 President, last Friday, December 7, 2012, the new United States Courthouse in Cedar Rapids, IA was dedicated. This facility was built to replace the previous courthouse, built in 1932, that was closed due to the extensive flood damage that occurred in June 2008.  The new courthouse has five courtrooms and associated facilities for the United States Courts operations and also houses a number of Federal Government agencies. Groundbreaking took place in April 2009. The new courthouse opened to the public on November 5. It is my understanding the courthouse was completed within budget and on time.  At the dedication ceremony last week, the keynote address was delivered by the Honorable David R. Hansen, Senior United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. I ask unanimous consent that his remarks be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Chief Judge Reade, Senator Grassley, Senator Harkin,      Distinguished Members of the Federal and State Judiciaries,      Mayor Corbett, Honored Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen:       May It Please The Court:       We gather today to dedicate this, the newest United States      Courthouse in these United States of America. It stands as a      fitting testament to the Federal Government's Design      Excellence program which employs the Nation's leading      architects and designers to design the country's newest      federal public buildings. In our case those professionals      were William Rawn and Associates of Boston and OPN Architects      of Cedar Rapids, and they have produced, with the excellent      efforts of the Ryan Companies this beautiful, eye-catching,      and awe-inspiring structure to house the components of the      United States District Court for the Northern District of      Iowa. The Northern District is composed of the northernmost      fifty-two counties in this state, with the dividing line      between the Northern and Southern districts basically along      Highway Thirty. The best news is that it was done on time and      within the budget.       Fifty years ago there were six Congressionally authorized      federal court points across this district. They were in      Dubuque, Cedar Rapids, Waterloo, Mason City, Fort Dodge, and      Sioux City. Not one of them was a stand-alone United States      Courthouse. All of them were buildings which principally      housed the United States Post Office for that city and      provided space for a courtroom and a judge's chambers,      usually on the second floor, along with some jury space.      Other non-court federal agencies were housed there too, and      they were really federal buildings. The players in the      federal court system had been and were scattered across the      district as well, with the Clerk of Court in Dubuque, the      Bankruptcy Referee in Fort Dodge, the United States Marshal      in Dubuque; and the Probation Office in Waterloo. The United      States Attorney was at times in Dubuque, Cedar Rapids,      Waterloo, Mason City, Fort Dodge, and Sioux City. Over the      years, and principally because of Judge Edward J. McManus's      initiatives, the various court functions were centralized      here in Cedar Rapids (for the eastern two-thirds of the      district) and in Sioux City for the Western Division.       The centralization meant that the United States Post Office      and Federal Building at 101 First Street SE, now City Hall,      here in Cedar Rapids, soon became way too small for the Court      and its offices, and we began our efforts to build a new      courthouse to bring the Federal Court family under a single      roof. It has taken more than twenty years' time, and a      monumental flood to make this United States Courthouse a      reality. It is also a reality because of the untiring efforts      of the entire Iowa Congressional delegation to make it so,      and of the unwavering support of this city's leaders, both      public and private, for which the Courts are very grateful.       But what is a courthouse? Or more specifically, what      attributes should a United States Courthouse have? Surely, as      you can easily discern, a courthouse is stone and steel,      glass and polished wood, art and architecture, pleasing lines      and soaring columns. But it is all those things combined to      inspire those who view it, those who work within it, and      those who are called to it, to the pursuit of the most lofty      goal of our democratic society--the attainment of justice for      all. As the ancient writer in the Old Testament enjoined his      readers--``Justice, Justice Thou Shalt Pursue.''       But it is not justice, in some raw or abstract sense, that      is to be pursued in this United States Courthouse: It is as      the inscription supporting the pediment of the United States      Supreme Court Building in Washington proclaims--It is Equal      Justice Under Law--that is, justice based on an equality of      treatment for those who seek it here, arrived at by applying      the Rule of Law. It is a justice based upon our First      Principles as outlined in the Declaration of Independence and      our Constitution. It is a justice arrived at by employing the      statutory laws, both Federal and State, that our      democratically elected representatives pass and our      presidents and governors approve, all of them acting in the      good faith pursuit of justice. It is a justice obtained by      the systematic weighing of the merits of each seeker's claim      to justice, pursuant to regularly established rules of      procedure by experienced and highly trained judges and well-     intentioned juries of the seeker's peers, together with the      assistance of able lawyers, all of whom have sworn an oath to      administer justice equally and to serve the rich and poor      alike. Oftentimes the line between justice and injustice is      not a bright one. Statues of Lady Justice are abundant--they      always show her holding a balance scale. Sometimes the scales      are shown to be evenly balanced and sometimes they are out of      balance.       Those who come here seeking justice for themselves will      sometimes leave disappointed, and they will go away mumbling      that ``Justice was not done'' when they really mean ``I      didn't win'': But because one didn't win doesn't mean that      justice under the Rule of Law wasn't administered in the      process of deciding their claim to it. The justice to be      obtained in this building is one informed by the law, based      on human reason, and guided by ancient precepts and common      sense. It is not an arbitrary judgment, nor is it dispensed      at the whim of the one who has the power to dispense it, be      it judge or jury.       Administering justice under law admits of no caprice and      permits no whimsy. In order to be true to its purpose, it is      to the tireless pursuit of justice that this building must be      dedicated.       In his 1951 Requiem For A Nun, the American novelist      William Faulker described the courthouse in his fictional      Yoknapatawpha County this way:       ``But above all, the courthouse: The center, the focus, the      hub, sitting looming in the center of the the county's      circumference like a single cloud in its ring of horizon;      laying its vast shadow to the uttermost rim of horizon;      musing, brooding, symbolic and ponderable, tall as cloud,      solid as rock, dominating all; protector of the weak,      judicate and curb of the passions and lusts, repository and      guardian of the aspirations and hopes''       Much of that description can be used to describe this real      courthouse. It is the center, the hub, the focus of the Third      Branch of government, the Judiciary, and of those who have      business with it. It is symbolic of the majesty and grace of      the law. It is nearly tall as cloud, solid as the tons of      rock used to build it, and it may be seen by some as rather      dominating in its appearance. It is emblematic of the trust      and confidence the people of the United States place in the      enduring National Government Lincoln described--``a      government of the people, by the people and for the people.''       But it is more than it appears to be--it is more than the      transcendent qualities it evokes when first seen. It is the      place where the rights of all citizens are protected, where      the passions of the majority are tempered by overarching      fundamental principles, and as Faulkner wrote, it is a place      where citizens with hopes and aspirations can repair for      redress.       This courthouse is all those things and more. The ``more''      is a goal that those of us who helped design it made clear at      the outset--it had to be as transparent as possible. It was      to be neither a castle on a hill nor a fortress of thick,      impenetrable walls. Rather than Faulkner's brooding and      formidable structure, we wanted one that, while imposing, was      also open and inviting. We wanted the citizens to be able to      see into the building, to see through it. As you approach the      entry, coming down First Street, you can easily see, behind      the glass wall, the entrances to each of the courtrooms. Once      inside, you can appreciate the abundance of natural light      everywhere. Every courtroom, every public space is filled      with it. This is not a dark place, where the forces of evil      can find repose. It has been purposely designed so that      natural sunshine will light the way of all who enter its      doors, of all who seek the truths to be found here, and of      all who engage in the never ending pursuit of justice to      which it is dedicated.       Thank you.                          ____________________
