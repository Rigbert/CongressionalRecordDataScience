President, there are few issues that I have ever felt more strongly about than the cruel devastation of whole societies by landmines. They are the worst of human depravity, a coward's weapon. At $2 or $3 dollars each, landmines like this one I am holding are sold by the hundreds of thousands and even millions.  There are 100 million unexploded landmines in over 60 countries. Armies leave, tanks withdraw, guns are unloaded, cannons are destroyed, the fighting ends, people even forget what the fighting was about, but the landmines stay, sometimes for decades.  In one country, they describe clearing the landmines an arm and a leg at a time. The children are often the innocent civilians. Every 22 minutes, somebody is horribly maimed or killed.  Mr. President, I hope this amendment is adopted overwhelmingly by this body to send a message to the world, so the United States can take the moral leadership as we did 3 years ago, as we did in the United Nations this past fall.  My opponents will say my amendment will endanger our troops--the same argument that was made against the chemical weapons ban.  Mr. President, our troops and civilians everywhere have far more to gain by what we do here.  Landmines are a weapon of choice in the very countries where our troops are likely to be sent in the future. A $2 mine can blow the legs off an American soldier as easily as it can pulverize a child.  Mr. President, let me repeat. This is not a prohibition, it is a moratorium that does not begin for 3 years. It does not cover Claymore mines. It does not cover antitank mines. Our troops have every weapon that shoots or explodes. We have far better ways of tracking the enemy than ever before. We have the most accurate weapons.  We are dealing with a global catastrophe. People everywhere are demanding an end to this madness. The U.S. Senate has led the way. We should continue to lead. This is not a weapon we need for our national security. It is a terrorist weapon used most often against the innocent.  I ask unanimous consent that several documents related to this matter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              Department of Social                                  Development and World Peace,                                   Washington, DC, August 3, 1995.       Dear Senator: We understand that the landmine issue will      soon be before the Senate. As you know, at our General      Meeting in June, the Catholic Bishops of the United States      approved unanimously a pastoral reflection entitled Sowing      Weapons of War: A Pastoral Reflection on the Arms Trade and      Landmines. In it, the U.S. Bishops joined Pope John Paul II      and bishops from around the world in calling for an end to      the manufacture and use of anti-personnel landmines.       Two months ago, the Holy Father stated, ``I should once      again like to make a vigorous appeal for the definitive      cessation of the manufacture and use of * * * `anti-personnel      mines'.'' The 100 million landmines that are strewn around      the world kill an estimated 500 people per week, most of whom      are civilians. Landmines cannot differeniate between civilian      and soldier or between periods of peace and war. From      Cambodia to Angola, they render large areas uninhabitable,      prevent refugees from returning home, inhibit post-war      reconstruction and development, and remain a long-term threat      to innocent life.       The bishops welcome the current U.S. moratorium on exports      of anti-personnel landmines and urge the United States to      take steps ``to further retrict its own use of landmines,      while it pursues with urgency and persistence international      agreements to restrict use globally.'' The Landmine Use      Moratorium Act (S. 940) would contribute to this goal by      prohibiting U.S. military exports to countries that continue      to export landmines and by imposing a one-year moratorium on      use by the United States of anti-personnel landmines, except      along international borders in monitored minefields. These      measures are a reasonable response to a serious problem that      affects millions of lives around the world.       We urge you to support Sen. Leahy's measure and to oppose      any amendments or substitutes that would weaken it.           Sincerely,                               Most Reverend Daniel P. Reilly,                                              Bishop of Worcester,     Chairman, Committee on International Policy.                                                                    ____                           Land-Mine Ban Woes       In 1994, about 100,000 land mines were removed from former      war zones at a cost of $70 million. At the same time, another      2 million mines were deployed elsewhere.       These and other sobering, frustrating statistics came out      of a three-day international conference in Geneva last week      on mine-clearing.       The daunting prospect of new mines being sown at a rate 20      times faster than they can be removed is matched by the      apparently futile attempts to ban the sale and manufacture of      these inexpensive weapons.       There is some momentum to enact an international ban, with      25 nations adopting moratoriums on mine exports and three--     Mexico, Sweden and Belgium--calling for comprehensive bans on      their sale and manufacture. But in Geneva, it was concluded      that banning land mines must be a long-term goal.       Despite the clear evidence that these weapons often can      serve as everlasting and deadly vestiges of wars long      resolved, some countries demand the right to keep them in      their inventories.       The nations that want to have land mines in their      inventories typically are not the same 64 countries where      collectively 100 million land mines kill or maim 500 persons      each week. If they were, perhaps a comprehensive ban would      not be so elusive.                Sanity May Take Root in Land Mine Debate       Far too many of us still see the hurt and disbelief in the      eyes of someone who has just been hit by a land mine. The      eyes that still bore into my mind are those of a little      Vietnamese girl who set off a mine while washing clothes on      the bank of the Perfume River in Hue in 1990--a full 15 years      after the war was supposed to be over for her and everyone      else.       The girl lay in a hospital bed in Hue with bandages over      most of her body. Her mother was attending her because of the      shortage of nurses. The mother looked up from her bedside      chair and asked me through a translator why the ``booms''      were still going off. Her daughter just stared at me in      searing silence.       I had no answer then, but have something hopeful to say      now. The U.S. Senate, perhaps this week but certainly this      summer, will confront the scourge that maims or kills      somebody in the world every 22 minutes. As many as half of      the victims are children like the one I saw in Hue.       Soldiers know how to detect and disarm mines. Children      don't. Sowing mines is like poisoning village wells: The      soldiers on both sides realize the danger, drink from their      canteens and move on. Not so with the villagers.       Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., and more than 40 Senate co-     sponsors have drafted legislation that would declare a one-     year moratorium on sowing mines on battlefields, starting      three years from now. Claymore mines, which infantrymen      spread around their positions at night and use in ambushes,      would be excluded from the experimental, one-year ban. So      would anti-tank mines. Also, international borders, like the      demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, could still      be sown with mines.       The Leahy proposal is but a short step toward the goal of      inspiring an international agreement to ban land mines the      way the nations managed to ban the use of poison gas and dum-     dum bullets. But it is a symbolic step. It will at least      force the Congress, the military and the public to confront      this uncontrolled sowing of poison seeds.       In the Senate, Leahy plans to tack the moratorium      legislation onto another bill on the floor, perhaps the      defense authorization bill.       In the House, Rep. Lane Evans, D-Ill., a Marine grunt from      1969 to 1971, is pushing a similar measure but has not      decided when to push for a vote. The hawkier House--which      seems determined to give the military almost anything it      wants--almost certainly will reject the amendment until the      Joint Chiefs of Staff say they favor it.       This hasn't happened despite expert testimony that it would      do the U.S. military more good than harm if land mines were      banned. No less a soldier than Gen. Alfred Gray Jr., former      Marine Corps commandant, has said:       ``We kill more Americans with our mines than we do anybody      else. We never killed many enemy with mines--. . . What the      hell is the use of sowing all this [airborne scatterable      mines] if you're going to move through it next week or next      month . . . I'm not aware of any operational advantage from      broad deployment of mines.''       Leahy warns that ``vast areas of many countries have become      deathtraps'' because 62 countries have sown between 80      million and 110 million land mines on their land. ``Every day      70 people are maimed or killed by land mines. Most of them      are not combatants. They are civilians going about their      daily lives.''       Yet mines are so cheap--costing as little as $2--that small      armies all over the world are turning to them as the poor      man's equalizer. American forces increasingly are being sent      to these developing areas and would be safer if land mines      were banned.       ``The $2 or $3 anti-personnel mine hidden under a layer of      sand or dust can blow the leg off the best-trained, best-     equipped American soldier,'' Leahy notes.       At the United Nations last year, President Clinton called      on the world to stop using land mines. He could weigh in      heavily on the side of the one-year moratorium and push the      chiefs in that direction. But don't count on it. He seems      determined during his re-election drive not to offend the      military and its conservative champions.       Belgium and Norway this year forbade the production, export      or use of land mines. Leahy and Evans hope the upcoming      debate will create a climate for a similar stand by the      United States. Lest you conclude the land mine moratorium is      being pushed by peacenik lawmakers, note that among the      senators supporting it are decorated war veterans Daniel K.      Inouye, D-Hawaii, J. Robert Kerrey, D-Neb., John F. Kerry, D-     Mass., and Charles S. Robb, D-Va.       The case for the Leahy-Evans moratorium is overwhelming.      Even so, Congress probably will lose its nerve and refuse to      enact the moratorium this year. But I think I could tell that      little girl in Hue, if she lived through her maiming, that      reason is beginning to assert itself. Man is beginning to see      the folly of fouling his own nest with mines. There is at      least a dim light at the end of the tunnel.
