 Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, my friend from Ohio just said why should people who pay their bill on time every month be penalized? I agree with him. But as the gentleman knows, right now people pay their bills on time every single month and, despite that, they can see a doubling or tripling of their interest rates, and that is precisely what we are trying to prevent.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).
