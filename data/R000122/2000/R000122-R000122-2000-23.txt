It is one of the situations where, after months and months of cooperating, of trying to accommodate, mutually, the desire and the recognition of getting things done, at some point when we see no movement with respect to our constitutional obligation to confirm judges, no real movement, when we see the elementary and secondary education bill that has been put out to languish and perhaps not to see the light of day for the rest of the year, when we see a process in which the price of bringing a bill to the floor is an agreement to surrender the rights of individual Senators to amend that legislation, to make that amendmentprocess subject to the approval of the majority leader, when we see all those things, what I think we have to do and what we must do is insist that we get back, away from that process of majority oppression. Perhaps that is too melodramatic. We have to get back to the rules of the Senate, the spirit of the Senate, which, I believe, is open debate, open amendment, and a vote.  Frankly, if that were the rule that was forthcoming from the majority leader, if the majority leader said, bring ESEA back, open up the amendment process, vote; when we finish the amendments, if the debate goes too long, in my prerogative, after long debate, I will enter a cloture motion--that is the way the Senate should operate. I suggest that is not the way this Senate is operating. That is why we are here today.  There is responsibility for every individual Senator for what happens on the floor of the Senate. Certainly the management of the Senate is within the grasp and the control immediately of the majority leader and the majority. That control has been deliberately, I think, to thwart the nomination and the confirmation of judges and deliberately to frustrate legislation important to the American people because there might be amendments that are uncomfortable for consideration by some in this body.
