Speaker, I would like to submit the following memo regarding H.R. 445:Heavy Duty Hybrid Vehicle Research, Development, and Demonstration Act                                 of 2009                         I. PURPOSE OF THE BILL       The purpose of H.R. 445, the `Heavy Hybrid Truck Research,      Development, and Demonstration Act of 2009,' is to establish      a research, development, demonstration, and commercial      application program to promote research of appropriate      technologies for heavy duty hybrid vehicles, and for other      purposes.                II. BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION       Because large, heavy duty trucks rely on a diesel or      gasoline internal combustion engine for power, they typically      have relatively low fuel economy and high emissions. This is      especially evident in trucks with duty-cycles that require      frequent starts and stops or long periods of engine idling to      power auxiliary systems such as bucket lifters, trash      compactors, off-board power tools, air conditioning,      refrigeration, or other work-related equipment. Switching a      portion of the driving and auxiliary power loads away from      the internal combustion engine to an alternate power source      would enable these vehicles to realize considerable fuel      savings and emissions reductions compared to conventional      models. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates      that an average delivery truck using a hybrid drive system      could save approximately 1,000 gallons of diesel per year      compared to one with a conventional drive system.       High fuel prices and tightening emissions standards provide      an added impetus for the development of new heavy duty hybrid      truck systems. Several manufacturers have technologies in      various stages of development for a range of large commercial      vehicle platforms such as package delivery vans, buses,      refuse collection trucks, large utility `bucket' trucks,      construction vehicles, and short- and long-haul tractor      trailer trucks. Research supported by the Department of      Defense (DOD) has also been a key driver of innovation for      heavy hybrids since these technologies can provide several      strategic advantages including substantial noise reduction, a      source of alternative power for radar and weapons systems,      reduction of overall weight and maintenance requirements, and      longer ranges between vehicle refueling. Despite substantial      investment in both the defense and commercial sectors, the      cost of research and development and the final price of heavy      duty hybrid vehicles remain prohibitively high, even for      military applications. Consequently, there remain significant      technical obstacles to development and final commercial      application of these technologies that federally-sponsored      R&D activities can help to overcome.       Managing a comprehensive federal R&D program is complicated      by the fact that there is no onesize-fits-all hybrid solution      for the entire heavy duty vehicle sector. The power demands      of heavy duty trucks are as varied as the applications, and      deploying hybrid models into heavy truck fleets is more      complicated than simply scaling up the hybrid systems used      for passenger vehicles. For example, through the course of an      average drive cycle the charging and discharging of a hybrid      system on a refuse truck with its frequent starts and stops,      dumpster lifting, and trash compaction will be considerably      different than that of a utility truck, which may idle in one      place for several hours to operate a boom or other equipment.      Furthermore, developing hybrid systems for long-haul tractor      trailer rigs (Class VIII) presents an even greater challenge      since these vehicles seldom brake during a drive cycle,      providing few opportunities for battery systems to recharge      through regenerative braking. The energy storage devices and      related control systems may be altogether different for each      of these platforms. Future generations of heavy trucks may      also include plug-in hybrid electric models that can store      more electric energy in larger banks of batteries and charge      these batteries through direct connection to the electricity      grid either while in operation on a jobsite or in a parking      lot or garage.       The majority of federal funding for hybrid vehicle R&D has      focused on passenger vehicles which far outnumber heavy      trucks. However, the federal R&D portfolio should address the      significant potential for fuel savings and emissions      reductions through improvements in the heavy duty vehicle      sector, and take advantage of the ability of this sector to      deploy new technologies quickly. For example, according to      the Oshkosh Truck Corporation, there are approximately 90,000      refuse trucks in the United States. Their collective fuel      consumption is equivalent to 2.5 million passenger vehicles      (based on 10,000 gallons/year per truck). Eaton Corporation      estimates that as few as 10,000 hybrid electric trucks could      reduce diesel fuel usage by 7.2 million gallons per year      (approx. 1 million barrels of oil), reduce annual NOx      emissions by the amount equivalent to removing New York      City's passenger cars for 25 days, and reduce carbon dioxide      emissions by 83,000 tons.       Energy storage technology options for hybrid trucks      generally include batteries, hybrid hydraulic systems, and      ultra-capacitors. Batteries receive the most attention and      research funding because of their applicability throughout      the transportation sector. To expand the use of electricity      in the vehicles sector, batteries must be smaller, lighter,      cheaper, and more powerful. Vehicle batteries typically fall      into one of three families of technologies: lead-acid, nickel      metal hydride (NiMH), and lithium-ion (Li-ion). Lead-acid      batteries have many advantages including their relative      simplicity and low cost, wide-scale availability, domestic      manufacturing capacity, and established recycling      infrastructure. NiMH batteries are found in the current      generation of hybrid vehicles and will be the battery of      choice for many of the first generation heavy hybrid trucks.      However, high weight and low power density are significant      issues for both lead-acid and NiMH batteries. Many in the      industry believe the future of hybrids depends on      breakthroughs in new battery technologies, such as the      lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries with their comparatively      low weight and high power density. In addition to      resolving remaining serious technical issues such as heat      management, the cost of manufacturing Li-ion batteries      remains prohibitively high for large-scale deployment in      vehicles. There is also concern that the U.S. is falling      behind countries like Japan, China and France in the race      to develop and mass produce batteries for hybrid vehicles.      Consequently, a significant effort is underway to build up      a domestic supply chain.       Plug-in hybrid applications that include an energy storage      system charged by an external power source are a particularly      attractive option for certain platforms of heavy duty      vehicles. Furthermore, heavy truck fleets provide a valuable      test-bed for demonstrating technologies that may ultimately      end up in the passenger vehicle market. Plug-in Hybrid      Vehicles (PHEV) is a critical near-to-mid term technology      option for drastically reducing the nation's dependence on      foreign oil. PHEV's, unlike traditional hybrid application,      shift most of the vehicle's energy source from petroleum to      domestically produced power from the electricity grid while      still providing sufficient power to handle heavy duty      applications. Some studies suggest that PHEV's may have the      added benefit of reducing transportation-related carbon      emissions, even if the electricity is generated solely from      coal. Much research remains in developing the technology to      reduce the weight and cost of the systems while improving      reliability.       The Department of Energy (DOE) has funded limited research      on the hybridization of     trucks, most recently through the 21st Century Truck      Partnership which conducts research and development through      joint public and private efforts. Other federal agencies      involved in the 21st Century Truck Partnership include the      Department of Defense, the Department of Transportation, and      EPA. Because of the highly fragmented nature of the heavy      duty vehicle manufacturing industry, there is limited in-     house research and testing capabilities for even the largest      of firms. The industry often relies on research efforts of      unique Federal facilities such as DOE's National Renewable      Energy Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory, the EPA's      National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory, and the      Army's National Automotive Center. Despite the potential      economic and environmental benefits of hybrid trucks and the      considerable technical hurdles that remain, the 21st Century      Truck Partnership is facing decreased funding and an      uncertain future as the administration chooses to focus      federal research on the passenger vehicle market. DOE does      not currently offer any competitive grants that target the      development of technologies applicable for use in hybrid      trucks.              III. SUMMARY OF MAJOR PROVISIONS OF THE BILL       H.R. 445 directs the Secretary of DOE (Secretary) to      establish a grant program for the development of advanced      heavy duty hybrid vehicles. The bill gives the Secretary the      discretion to award between three and seven grants based on      the technical merits of the proposals received. At least half      of the awarded grants must be for the development of plug-in      hybrid trucks.       Grants are awarded to applicants for two phases of research      and development. In phase one, recipients must build at least      one advanced heavy duty hybrid vehicle, conduct studies of      the vehicle, and report to DOE on the performance, cost, and      emissions levels of the vehicle. In phase two, recipients      must produce 50 advanced heavy duty hybrid vehicles and      report to DOE on the technological challenges and estimated      costs involved in wide-scale manufacture.       H.R. 445 also directs the Secretary to conduct a study of      alternative power train designs for use in advanced heavy      duty hybrid vehicles. The study includes analysis of      different designs under conditions of typical use. The bill      also directs the Secretary to establish a pilot program      through the National Laboratories to research and test the      effects on the domestic electric power grid of widespread use      of plug-in hybrid vehicles.       Grant applicants may include partnerships between      manufacturers, electrical utilities, or other entities to      fulfill the program's requirements. Awards under H.R. 445      will be for up to $3 million per year for three years. The      bill also amends the Energy Storage Competitiveness Act of      2007 (enacted as section 641(g)(1) of the Energy Independence      and Security Act of 2007 (42 U.S.C. 17231(g)(1)) to include      heavy trucks in the Secretary's priorities for applied energy      storage research.              IV. SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE BILL     Section I. Short title       H.R. 445 can be cited as the ``Heavy Duty Hybrid Vehicle      Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 2009.''     Section 2. Advanced Heavy Duty Hybrid Vehicle Technology          Research, Development, Demonstration, and Commercial          Application Program       Section 2(a) directs the Secretary to establish a program      to provide grants to carry out projects to advance research      and demonstrate technologies for advanced heavy duty hybrid      vehicles.       Section 2(b) requires the Secretary to issue application      requirements and to establish criteria for making grant      awards. The Secretary must give priority to applicants who      are best able to advance the current state of technology and      achieve the greatest reductions in fuel consumption and      emissions. To be eligible, recipients must produce trucks      with a gross weight between 14,000 and 33,000 pounds (e.g.      Class IV through Class VII vehicles). The Secretary is given      discretion to award between three and seven grants based on      the technical merits of the applications received. At least      half of the grants are to be awarded for plug-in hybrid      technology. Applicants can partner with other entities to      fulfill the obligations of the program.       Section 2(c) defines two phases of research by award      recipients. In phase one, each recipient has one year to      build or retrofit one or more advanced heavy duty hybrid      vehicles. Recipients are required to collect and analyze data      on the performance of key vehicle components; the estimated      costs of producing, operating, and maintaining the vehicle;      the emissions of the vehicle; and on overall vehicle      performance according to guidelines established by the      Secretary.       If, at the conclusion of phase one, it is clear that a      grant recipient will be unable to complete the requirements      of phase two, the Secretary has the discretion to waive the      requirement for phase two research and terminate the grant to      that recipient.       In phase two, recipients are required to demonstrate the      advanced manufacturing processes of heavy duty plug-in      vehicles by producing or retrofitting 50 advanced heavy duty      hybrid vehicles within two years. Recipients must also report      on the major technological obstacles they encounter in      developing and producing the vehicles and on the projected      costs of each vehicle.       Award recipients are eligible to receive three million      dollars per year for three years to complete both phases of      the development program.       Section 2(d) directs the Secretary to conduct a study of      alternative power train designs for use in advanced heavy      duty hybrid vehicles. The study would analyze these different      designs under conditions which they are typically used,      including the average number of miles driven, the time spent      with the engine at idle, horsepower requirements, the length      of time the maximum power is required, and other factors the      Secretary determines to be appropriate.       Section 2(e) requires the Secretary to report to Congress      within 60 days on the findings of the reports submitted by      grant recipients.       Section 2(f) and 2(g) require the Secretary to coordinate      the research conducted under this program with other research      conducted by the Department. The cost sharing provisions of      section 988 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C.      16352) apply to the program.       Section 2(h) directs the Secretary to establish a pilot      program through DOE's National Laboratories to research and      test the effects on the domestic electric power grid of the      widespread use of plug-in hybrid vehicles, including heavy      duty plug-in hybrid trucks.       Section 2(i) defines the terms: advanced heavy duty hybrid      vehicle, greenhouse gas, plug-in hybrid, retrofit, and      Secretary for the purposes of this section.       Section 2(j) authorizes appropriations of $16 million per      year for fiscal years 2010 through 2012.     Section 3. Expanding research in hybrid technology for large          vehicles       This section amends the United States Energy Storage      Competitiveness Act of 2007 (enacted as section Sec.      641(g)(1) of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007      (42 U.S.C. 17231(g)(1)) to include vehicles with a gross      weight over 8501 pounds in the Secretary's priorities for      advanced energy storage.                                V. VIEWS       The hybridization of heavy duty trucks is an important goal      that has been largely overlooked by the Federal government.      While numerous federal grants are available for the      production of hybrid and plug-in hybrid passenger vehicles,      there are no grants available that specifically target the      development of heavy duty hybrid vehicles. This is an      unfortunate oversight. Federal investment in this research      will result in improvements in the fuel efficiency and      emission profiles of heavy duty vehicles and is likely to      provide significant economic benefits as well as benefits in      energy efficiency and air quality.       The Secretary is encouraged to award the maximum number of      grants if sufficient meritorious applications are received.      Research applicable to heavy duty vehicles that make frequent      stops such as delivery trucks, buses, and refuse collection      vehicles and vehicles that idle on job sites for extensive      periods to operate auxiliary functions such as utility      `bucket' trucks should receive the highest priority for      funding under this program. This research and development      program is not intended to provide support for research and      development on large, Class IV, passenger trucks. The      definition of Advanced Heavy Duty Hybrid Vehicle included in      the legislation specifically excludes Class VIII heavy duty      vehicles (e.g. long-haul tractor trailer trucks).      Significantly different technical requirements of those      platforms merits funding under separate programs.       It is important to provide funding to applicants best able      to provide the greatest potential advancement over current      technologies and for research that is most likely to lead to      reduced fuel consumption and reduced emissions. In many      cases, this will mean awarding applicants who propose hybrid      designs that rely on multiple sources of energy for      propulsion, and integration of propulsion and auxiliary power      systems as this approach entails a greater technical      challenge.       Intellectual property rights and ownership of actual      vehicles built under this program are intended to benefit the      grant recipients who develop them. The Department of Energy      is encouraged to grant waivers of such rights.                          ____________________
