 WARNER. Just one sentence and I will yield. There has been a historical--over a 100 years--inability of the major nations of Europe to live in peace with one another. Indeed that is the principal purpose of NATO--the U.S. presence, both with military there, with a strong voice so as to ensure the tranquility this treaty has preserved for 49 years. It has exceeded every expectation of the drafters of the treaty and those who promoted and supported it in these 49 years. It is a magnificent document. I have fought hard with others to preserve the integrity of that document. Does the Senator wish to say a word?
