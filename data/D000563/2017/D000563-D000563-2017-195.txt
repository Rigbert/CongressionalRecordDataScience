Here is what he said:       Compared with its predecessors, the bill would increase the      ranks of America's medically uninsured more--by millions of      people--cost state governments billions more and pave the way      for the elimination of all protection for those with      preexisting medical conditions.  He goes on to say:       Among the biggest losers of federal funding would be the      states that had the foresight to expand Medicaid under the      Affordable Care Act and the resolve to reach out to lower-     income residents [and provide health insurance] coverage.  He goes on to say that, under this Cassidy-Graham bill, ``they'd be punished with draconian cuts in healthcare funding.''  He goes on to write:       Among the big winners would be the states that have done      nothing of the kind for their residents--refusing the      Medicaid expansion and interfering with outreach efforts [to      bring more people into health insurance coverage].
