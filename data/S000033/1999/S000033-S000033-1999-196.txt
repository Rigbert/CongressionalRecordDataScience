 Speaker, I would like to have printed in the Record statements by high school students from my home State of Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people today. I am asking that you please insert these statements in the Congressional Record as I believe that the views of these young persons will benefit my colleagues.                        Minimum Wage in Vermont       (On behalf of Brandi Russin, Tonya Boutin and Nicole King)       Brandi Russin: We are here to talk about the minimum wage      in Vermont. We feel that it is a little bit low for the      price. The living expenses in Vermont are very high compared      to the minimum wage.       Tonya Boutin: I feel that with the life that we are living      now, that the expenses are very high, and the minimum wage is      not enough. We have got car payments to pay, we have gas, we      have other things that we need to spend our money on, and      with the minimum wage, it is not enough. If you think about      all the stuff--       Brandi Russin: I don't know if you are interested. We      brought some forms along for you to look at. Right here, I      have pay stubs from a job when I was earning regular minimum      wage, and this is the net amount. We just want to note the      small amounts on these checks. And we have all noticed, at      the jobs when we've been getting paid minimum wage, you get      like a $60 to an $80 check per week, and you are like, Oh,      you know, I can just spend this here, spend this here, and      you tend not to save as much money. And as we grow up a      little, we know we have a lot to save for. And this is also      another job where it is more than minimum wage, and, on the      bottom, you can see the amounts are much larger. And with      amounts like this, you think, Wow, you know, maybe I should      be setting some of this aside for something.       We would like you just to see that. And we also made some      forms up on some expenses that teenagers do have in their      lifetime. And $5.25 is not adequate, we feel, along with most      other teenagers.       We also made up a little tiny fact sheet saying that, if      you want to see a movie on minimum wage, the movie price is      $7.50 to get into a movie. So if you want to go to see a      movie, you have to work for an hour and a half at your job to      see one movie. And a lot of teenagers like to wear Levi      jeans, and those cost--we did an estimate of $45. If you want      to go buy a pair of jeans for yourself, you have to work nine      hours for a pair of jeans.       Congressman Sanders: Anyone else that wanted to add      anything?       Nicole King: When I started working, I started my first job      last June, once I got out of school. I was making $5.50 at      that job, but I didn't feel I was making enough to make care      payments, car insurance, and my other living expenses, so I      started working a second job. And between the two of those, I      was working between 50 and 65 hours a week. And I could only      do that for about a month and a half, and I had to quit my      first job because I was getting more hours at my second job.       Congressman Sanders: Tonya, did you have anything to add to      that?       Tonya Boutin: I was working at a job that was paying      minimum wage, and I found that, the more hours I got was      better, but my paychecks weren't satisfying. You know, I      just--I worked hard to get the money that I earned, and the      paycheck that I was getting just didn't satisfy me. And to      try to save up money is very hard, because you only get      a certain amount, and, you know, you pay your bills and      what you need to do, and you only like 20 bucks at the      end, and it is not enough.       Brandi Russin: As both of these, I was working two jobs      also. I was working over 70 hours a week, and finally I said      to myself, I can't keep doing this. And when you become a      senior in high school, you realize all the college expenses      coming up, and you say, Wow, where am I going to get the      money from? So you start doing what we did, and panic, and      you start working 50 to 70 hours a week, and you say, Where      am I going to get all the money from? And you have to say no      to yourself, you have to say, I need to stop and realize what      I am doing to myself, and I am not getting enough sleep, and      I am just going to keep working, keep working for this money.                                       ____                      National Health Care System            (On behalf of Zarina Williams and Melanie Campo)       Zarina Williams: The United States should have a national      health care system. Nationally, Americans spent $1.2 trillion      on health care in 1998, and the amount is increasing each      year. Thirty-seven million out of 270 million people in      America do not receive adequate health care. Many Americans      cannot afford private medical insurance, but do not qualify      for Medicaid or Medicare. Some people who have private      insurance have to do without treatment because they cannot      afford the deductible.       There are other countries that have national health care.      France has a national health care system, where the      government reimburses 85 percent of medical costs, and you      have your choice of doctors and dentists. Germany also has a      national health care system, where the government pays for      unemployed welfare recipients and employed people up to a      certain income. People who earn high income take out private      insurance, because the government does not pay for the health      care. Most hospitals in Germany are run by states and      municipalities, not privately owned.       Melanie Campo: In the United States, government should      provide national health care. Financial means should not      determine the quality of the medical services a citizen      receives. If we had a national health care system, people      would want to become doctors to help people, not for the      money. Almost every industrialized country provides partial      health care coverage for its citizens. Why shouldn't America?       A plan proposed in Massachusetts would eliminate four-     fifths of the out-of-pocket health costs. Funds for this plan      could come from savings in administrative costs of the      system, money from the federal government, and money      employers and employees now contribute to health insurance      premiums. Additional money would be generated through new      taxes of 1.5 percent on income and 1 percent on payroll. With      this plan, everyone would receive the same coverage. This      plan would negotiate drug prices and regulate medical costs.                                       ____                            Peer Counseling        (On behalf of Lee Knight, Anna Tornello and Gigi Craig)       Anna Tornello: We have changed our topic to peer counseling      at Colchester High School.       In the past several months, there have been bomb threats,      weapon threats, and many unfortunate deaths. When we were on      vacation, the Littleton, Colorado, incident happened, and      when we came back to school, we were all really scared.       Lee Knight: And that is why we want to start a peer      counseling group. It's because we don't want the same tragedy      that happened at Columbine High School to happen here. One of      the reasons why students turn to violence was because of the      way that the society looked at them. Kids and students should      not be judged by the way they dress. It doesn't matter what      they look like; it is who they are on the inside. It is just      like philosopher John Locke said: People are not born good or      evil, but they are shaped by their surroundings. In which, in      our case, our surroundings are the society that we live in.      And we want to stop criticism that happens in schools all      around the nation.       Anna Tornello: As we know, not one student can save a whole      school from the same kind of tragedy that happened at      Columbine High School. And students have guidance counselors      at the school, but most students     are afraid to talk to their guidance counselors, and one      reason is because they are afraid that they might tell their      parents or they might tell other people. That's why we feel      that peers of your own age, you should be able to talk to      them. And that's what we think.       Gigi Craig: What we need is full-time guidance counselors      to respond quickly to students' needs, if they are feeling      that they are going to hurt themselves or hurt somebody else.      We can't wait a week, because we don't know what will happen      by then.       Anna Tornello: We have talked to Phillip Brown, who is a      licensed psychiatrist in Vermont, and he said that the peer      counseling would be a really good idea, because it will help      the kids be able to talk to other people better, and if there      is a problem like where somebody is going to hurt themselves      or somebody else, then you need to go seek professional help.      But we can help people with just little problems, and that      will help the students be able to talk and get out their      feelings.       The group at Colchester High School, we hope, will someday      help the peer counseling, and maybe someday it will be able      to spread through Vermont, and maybe the nation. And we feel      that students should be able to feel safer at school, and      that every student needs to have somebody that cares, and      somebody to talk to when they need help. And we feel that all      these goals can be accomplished with the help of the      community, the government, adults, and other students. We      don't want to get this swept underneath the rug. We want to      make a difference in the community, and, most of all, we want      to help kids that are normal on the outside but are crying on      the inside.
