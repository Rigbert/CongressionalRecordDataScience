President, the Senator from Mississippi has graciously allowed me to speak before him, and I ask unanimous consent that Senator Wicker be recognized immediately upon the conclusion of my comments.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). Without objection, it is so ordered.                          ____________________
