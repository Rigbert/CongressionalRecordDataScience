I was going to ask, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, if the Senator believes we should approve Miguel Estrada because he was rated well qualified by the American Bar Association, has the Senator from Utah ever failed to approve a nominee from President Clinton who was well qualified by the American Bar Association? I think the Senator has answered that question that there were times when he rejected nominees, voted against nominees, refused to have hearings for nominees, delayed hearings on nominees who were rated well qualified by the American Bar Association.
