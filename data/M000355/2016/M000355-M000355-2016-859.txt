 President, Elaine and I were saddened by the passing of Conrad Burns last month. Senator Burns was a big personality from a big State. He will certainly be missed by those who had the opportunity to know him.  Our thoughts were with Phyllis and the Burns family then, and they remain with Phyllis and the Burns family today.  The Senate remembers this former colleague.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 457, submitted earlier today.
