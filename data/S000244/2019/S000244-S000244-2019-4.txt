The majority leader just admitted that. This is a missed opportunity, and it is highly disappointing.  The American people want us to work in a bipartisan manner. The American people want us to accomplish things, and this is a poison pill that will make sure that this bill never sees the light of day in the Senate and will never become law.  When they take up this bill, I hope they strip out all the ObamaCare bailout--free of poison pills--and pass the bipartisan drug pricing bills so the House will be able to reconsider them in a more bipartisan fashion.
