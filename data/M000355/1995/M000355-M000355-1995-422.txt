 President, in conclusion, let me remind everybody that on this proposal offered by the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, Common Cause, the Washington Post, the ACLU, and George Will all think it is a bad idea.  Mr. President, I rest my case. I hope the motion of the Senator from Utah to table will be agreed to.  I yield the remainder of my time.
