President, I want to set the record straight on something that the senior Senator from Utah said yesterday regarding the President's February 2002 directive on the treatment of al-Qaida and Taliban detainees. According to Senator Hatch, ``the President [said] unequivocally that detainees are to be treated humanely.'' In fact, the President's directive said only that ``the U.S. Armed Forces'' should treat detainees humanely. The President's directive pointedly did not apply to the CIA and other nonmilitary personnel.  I asked Judge Gonzales:       Does the President's February 7, 2002, directive regarding      humane treatment of detainees apply to the CIA or any other      non-military personnel?  He replied:       No. By its terms, the February 7, 2002, directive      ``reaffirm[s] the order previously issued by the Secretary of      Defense to the United States Armed Forces.''  In other words, contrary to what he have heard, and continue to hear, from Judge Gonzales's supporters, the President's oft-quoted directive regarding the humane treatment of detainees is carefully worded to permit the occasional inhumane treatment of detainees. Indeed, that is one of the legal loopholes that concerns so many of us.  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
