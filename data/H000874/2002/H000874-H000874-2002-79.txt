She has talked to me and I know she has talked to the chairman. She has been working tirelessly on this issue and has great concern about it. I would be happy to work with her and the Postal Service to address the facilities need of the Jensen Drive Postal Station in Houston.  As the gentlewoman knows, the committee is very concerned with the financial system the Postal Service is in. As the Postal Service continues to address their fiscal deficits, they should not lose sight of the local communities that they serve. That is the gentlewoman's point. She is absolutely right on that point. Her concerns for those with disabilities and the elderly in accessing the Postal Service is absolutely essential.  To that end, I think the gentlewoman will be successful in her efforts working with us.
