This section was added during negotiations on the amendment that became the final text of the bill. It directly amends ICHIA to prohibit States from covering certain individuals who are lawfully present in the United States on student and tourist visas. Had the Senate intended to similarly exclude from ICHIA individuals granted RPI, Blue Card, and V-visa status, it would have explicitly done so.
