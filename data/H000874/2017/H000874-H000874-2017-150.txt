Speaker, I thank the gentleman.  Mr. Speaker, lastly, I would say that obviously I know the gentleman and I, and I think the overwhelming majority of Members of the House on both sides of the aisle, are very concerned that we ensure that sanctions on Iran's malevolent actions and Russia's actions, including involving itself in an American election, is an item of concern. I know the gentleman is working on it.  Can the gentleman tell me what he thinks the schedule for that bill might be?  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman knows, unfortunately, in the Senate, we had a constitutional challenge on a blue slip on the way they passed their bill. There is concern on this side that we want to make sure we move that bill in a very quick manner and do it correctly.  I do believe that there is a bill that moved out of here that there is an addition that should be added, North Korea. That came out of here 419-1, but I believe Iran, the work that Russia has done, and what North Korea has done, it would be a very strong statement for all of America to get that sanction bill completed and done and to the President's desk as soon as possible.
