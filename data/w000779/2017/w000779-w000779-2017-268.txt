President, today I, along with my colleague Senator Paul from Kentucky, am introducing the Protecting Data at the Border Act, a bill that protects Americans and U.S. Permanent Residents from warrantless searches of their electronic devices at the border.  1n 2014, the Supreme Court established in California v. Riley that law enforcement agencies must obtain a probable cause search warrant before they can search someone's phone or laptop during a ``search incident to arrest.'' Prior to that decision, law enforcement agencies around the country routinely engaged in warrantless searches of phones and other electronic devices. The Supreme Court rightly recognized that we need new, stronger rules to protect digital information.  Although the warrant protections from Riley have been the law of the land for the last three years, a significant loophole has remained: the border. The Riley decision left unresolved the question of whether or not U.S. Customs can search the smartphones and laptops of U.S. persons as they leave the country and return home. This is not a theoretical concern. According to recent statistics provided by Customs and Border Protection, searches of cellphones by border agents has exploded, growing fivefold in just oneyear, from fewer than 5,000 in 2015 to nearly 25,000 in 2016. Five-thousand devices were searched this last February alone, more than in all of 2015.  My colleague, Senator Paul and I intend to close this loophole, ensuring that U.S. persons crossing the border do not have lesser digital privacy rights than individuals who are arrested inside the United States.  This bill has four main components.  First, it requires that law enforcement agencies obtain a probable cause warrant before they can search the laptop, smartphone or other electronic device belonging to a U.S. person at the border. The bill includes an emergency exception to this warrant requirement, modeled after USA Freedom Act section 102, which became law in 2015.  Second, it requires informed, written consent before the government may request and obtain voluntary assistance from a U.S. person accessing data on a locked device or account, such as by disclosing their password or otherwise providing access. The bill also prohibits the government from delaying or denying entry to a U.S. person if he or she refuses to provide such assistance.  Third, it requires that the government obtain a warrant before it can copy and retain a U.S. person's data, even if the data has been collected without a warrant, during an emergency.  Fourth, it requires that the government create and publish statistics on the electronic border searches they conduct.  Passage of this bill would ensure that the important privacy rights recognized by the Supreme Court in Riley also apply at the border, while still enabling law enforcement agencies continue to do the important work of keeping our country safe.  I thank my colleague Senator Paul for his efforts on this bill, and I hope the Senate will consider our proposal quickly.                                 ______                                       By
