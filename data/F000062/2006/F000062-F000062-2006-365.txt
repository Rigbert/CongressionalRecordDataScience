  Mr. President, I am very pleased to be here as a member of the Judiciary Committee and as a Californian to indicate my support for the confirmation of Milan Smith to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. It is a fine occasion to be able to come here and represent that we have a very competent man to become an appellate court judge.  Mr. Smith has a long and distinguished legal career in our State. The chairman of the committee pointed out some of this. After graduating from the University of Chicago Law School in 1969, Milan Smith moved to Los Angeles where he has been an important part of the legal community ever since.  Mr. Smith founded the law firm known as Smith Crane Robinson & Parker in 1972, and over the last 34 years with Smith Crane Robinson & Parker he has engaged in a wide-ranging legal practice in business and real estate law.  After reviewing his extensive record, a majority of the American Bar Association rated him ``well qualified'' to serve as a judge of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.  He has demonstrated an impressive and enduring commitment to serving the public, from presiding over the Governing Board of the Los Angeles State Building Authority to acting as vice chairman of Ettie Lee Homes for Youth.  As many of you know, Milan Smith is the older brother of our esteemed colleague, Senator Gordon Smith. I know the Senator from Idaho was just talking to Senator Smith and saying: Isn't it nice that California is getting a Californian.  We are having a little tussle over another judge which the Senator from Idaho believes should be an Idaho judge, and the Senators from California believe should be a California judge. So that issue has not yet to be joined, but it certainly will.
