President, I rise to oppose the nomination of Eric Dreiband to be the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department.  Mr. Dreiband has no experience working on many of the most important duties of the Civil Rights Division, such as protecting voting rights, combating hate crimes, and ensuring that police departments respect the Constitution and civil rights laws.  Instead, he has extensive experience representing corporations who have been accused of employment discrimination and advocating against legislation to protect civil rights.  In his personal capacity, he has testified against the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act and against legislation to protect older workers from discrimination.  We need a head of the Civil Rights Division who will demonstrate independence and a willingness to preserve the right to vote and civil rights laws in the face of this administration's regressive agenda.  I am not confident that Mr. Dreiband will be the independent leader that the Civil Rights Division needs. I cannot support his nomination.
