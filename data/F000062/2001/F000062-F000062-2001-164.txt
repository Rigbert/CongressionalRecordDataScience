 President, I am pleased to co-sponsor this amendment with Senators Voinovich, Baucus, Cochran, Landrieu, Murray, and Corzine.  Under current law, elementary and secondary teachers can receive up to $5,000 of their student loans forgiven in exchange for 5 years of teaching. Head Start teachers are not currently included in the federal loan forgiveness program. By offering Head Start teachers the same loan forgiveness benefit as that afforded to elementary and secondary school teachers, I believe, we will encourage more college graduates to enter the field.  Many Head Start programs in California are losing qualified teachers to local school districts in part because the pay is better--nationally, the average Head Start teacher made $20,700 in 2000 compared to $40,575 for an elementary and secondary school teacher. Head Start teachers are making half of what elementary and secondary teachers are paid on average.  Low pay, combined with mounting student loan debt, is a real deterrent to getting college graduates to become Head Start teachers.  Today, there are no educational requirements for a Head Start teacher other than a child development associate (CDA) credential, requiring 24 early child education credits and 16 general education credits. By 2003, 50 percent of Head Start teachers will be required to have at minimum an associate or 2-year degree.  Under this amendment, a Head Start teacher who has completed at minimum a bachelor's degree could receive up to $5,000 of their federal student loan forgiven provided they agree to teach for at least 5 years in a Head Start program.  Clearly, we should recruit qualified teachers to the Head Start field who have demonstrated knowledge and teaching skills in reading, writing, early childhood development, and other areas of the preschool curriculum with a particular focus on cognitive learning. Obtaining and maintaining teachers with such educational backgrounds will, I believe, improve the cognitive learning portion of the Head Start program so that our youngsters can start elementary school ready to learn.  Several recent studies confirm the importance of investing in the education and training of those who work with preschoolers.  The National Research Council has recommended that:       . . . children in an early childhood education and care      program should be assigned a teacher who has a bachelor's      degree with specialized education related to early childhood.      . . . Progress toward a high-quality teaching force will      require substantial public and private support and incentive      programs, including innovative education programs,      scholarship and loan programs, and compensation commensurate      with the expectations of college graduates.  Last year, the Head Start 2010 National Advisory Panel held fifteen national hearings and open forums. The panel found:       . . . that despite increases resulting from Federal quality      set-aside funding, relatively low salaries and poor or non-     existent benefits make it difficult to attract and retain      qualified staff over the long term. . . . the quality of the      program is tied directly to the quality of the staff.  Head Start is one of the most important federal programs because it has the potential to reach children early in their formative years when their cognitive skills are just developing. Many of our Nation's youngsters, however, enter elementary school without the basic skills necessary to succeed. Often these children lag behind their peers throughout their academic career.  I believe we must continue to improve the cognitive learning aspects of the Head Start program so that children leave the program able to count to ten, to recognize sizes and colors, and to recite the alphabet. To ensure cognitive learning, we must continue to raise the standards for Head Start teachers. Offering Head Start teachers similar compensation for their educational achievements and expenses afforded to other teachers is one step to encouraging college graduates to become Head Start teachers.                          ____________________
