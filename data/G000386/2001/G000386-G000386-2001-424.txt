 President, I rise in opposition to the Hutchinson amendment. This tax amendment is not appropriate at this time. The pending underlying legislation is not a revenue bill.  If this amendment passes, this important bill will be potentially subject to a ``blue slip'' by the House. A ``blue slip'' would in effect kill this bill and the Senate would have to start anew.  Therefore, a tax amendment at this time would unnecessarily jeopardize the good work of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.  I would note that this provision regarding private activity bonds for school construction is contained in the Finance Committee bill passed yesterday, and that bill will be taken up tomorrow for consideration.  I have had a very long history on this matter of encouraging school construction, and specifically this very language that is contained in the amendment. I am very pleased that I was able to include this school construction bond language in the tax bill and look to hopefully having it signed into law.  For these reasons, while I know that the Senator has offered this amendment with the best of intentions, unfortunately, I must respectfully oppose this amendment.
