President, before she leaves the floor, I want to say to my seatmate on the Energy Committee, I am looking forward to working closely with her on a host of these issues. I think she is spot-on with respect to her concern about the independents. This morning we talked about natural gas, where there is enormous potential. I want to assure my friend and colleague I will be working very closely with her.
