President, I ask unanimous consent when the time goes back to this side, that first the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia be recognized and then his distinguished colleague from West Virginia, Senator Manchin, be recognized, both to speak for the time remaining to the Senator from Vermont.  I ask unanimous consent that when time is yielded back to me, the time remaining to the Senator from Vermont, which will be approximately 15 minutes, be divided between the two Senators from West Virginia.
