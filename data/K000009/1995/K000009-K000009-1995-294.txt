Now, you might ask yourselves, where is that money? If you look back at 1991, there were two billionaires in Mexico, according to Fortune Magazine. Now there are over 2 dozen.  Where do they have their money? Do you know what happened back in the early 1980's when Mexico got into trouble before when it owed several billion dollars? There was between $40 and $60 billion dollars worth of money from citizens in Mexico deposited in United States banks, the very same banks that Mexico owed money to. So being very simple-minded, I said just let them take their money back home.  What happened in this particular situation--and it was carefully orchestrated--the smart money left Mexico before the peso meltdown. If you look at the trade figures for the last year, you will see one of the top three exports to Mexico from the United States after NAFTA has been in two or three interesting areas: art, antiques, and collectibles.  Now, who would buy art, antiques, and collectibles to hedge against a possible devaluation? So they took their money out of the country, brought into the country goods that will sell anywhere in the world. So part of our job should be to drive it back in the country rather than put the money out.
