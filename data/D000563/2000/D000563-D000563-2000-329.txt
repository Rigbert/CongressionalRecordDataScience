President, I have spoken about the drug problems in America and this issue of foreign policy. But there is another issue which is a continuing concern across America. It is the fact that this Senate and Congress have failed to act on the problem in America of gun violence. It has been a little over a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still the leadership in this Congress refuses to enact sensible gun safety legislation.  Most will recall that a little over a year ago, we passed in this Chamber, with the tie breaking vote of Vice President Gore, legislation which would allow us to do background checks on people who buy guns at gun shows. If you go to buy a gun here in America, they are going to ask some questions: Do you have a history of committing a crime; a history of violent mental illness; are you old enough to own a gun? That is part of the Brady law. And with that law, we stopped some 500,000 people from buying guns in America who were, in fact, people with a criminal record or a history of violent and mental illness, or children. We stopped it--half a million of them--but there is a big loophole there. If you go to the so-called gun shows which we have in Illinois and States such as Texas and all over the country, these gun bazaars and flea markets do not have any background checks. You do not have to be John Dillinger and the greatest criminal mind to understand if you need a gun, do not go to a gun dealer, go to a gun show. No questions are asked; you can buy it on the spot.  We passed a law. We said we have to close this loophole. If we really want to keep guns out of the hands of people who will misuse them, we need a background check at gun shows. That was part of our bill.  The second part of the bill related to a provision with which Senator Kohl from Wisconsin came forward. It said if you sell a handgun in America, it should have a child safety protection device, or so-called trigger lock. You have seen them. They look like little padlocks. You put them over the trigger so if a child gets his hands on a gun, he or she will not be able to pull the trigger and harm anyone.  Is this important? It is critically important. We read every day in the newspapers about kids being harmed, killing their playmates, and terrible things occurring when they find a handgun. It is naive for any gun owner to believe if they have a gun in the house, they can successfully hide a gun. Children are always going to find Christmas gifts and guns. We have to acknowledge that as parents. If they find Christmas gifts, it is disappointing. If they find guns, it can be tragic.  Those who say they will not have a gun in their house if they have little kids may not have peace of mind if they know their playmates' parents own guns and do not have a trigger lock on them.  We said as a matter of standard safety in America, we want every handgun to be sold with a trigger lock. Is it an inconvenience for the gun owner? Yes, let's concede that fact. Do we face inconveniences every day bringing safety to our country and to our lives? Of course we do. Have you gone through an airport lately? Did you have to put that purse or that briefcase on the conveyor belt? Did you go through the metal detector? It is inconvenient, isn't it? It slowed you down, didn't it? We all do it because we do not want terrorists on airplanes and we want to fly safely.  So the idea of a trigger lock on a handgun I do not believe is a major obstacle to gun ownership or using a gun safely and legally. That was the second part of the bill that passed and went over to the House of Representatives.  The third part is one that is hardly arguable, and that is, we ban the domestic manufacture of high-capacity ammunition clips in this country, clips that can hold up to 100 or more bullets. The belief was nobody needed them. The only people who would need those would be the military or police. The average person has no need for them.  I said time and again that if a person needs an assault weapon or some sort of automatic weapon with a 100-round clip to shoot a deer, they ought to stick to fishing. Sadly, there are people who found if you could not manufacture these high-capacity ammo clips in the United States, you could import them from overseas. The third part of our gun safety legislation said we are going to stop the importation of high-capacity ammo clips which are designed to kill people. They have nothing to do with legitimate sports or hunting.  Three provisions: Background checks at gun shows, trigger locks on handguns when they are sold, and no more importation of high-capacity ammo clips. Do those sound like radical ideas to you? They do not to me. They sound like a commonsense effort to keep guns out of the hands of people who would misuse them.  We barely passed the bill. The National Rifle Association, the gun lobby, opposed it. The bill received 49 votes for, 49 votes against. Vice President Al Gore sat in that chair, as he is entitled under the Constitution, and cast the tie-breaking vote--50-49. The bill went to the House of Representatives--this is after Columbine--and with all this determination, we said: We are finally going to do something to respond to gun violence.  Of course, when it went over to the House of Representatives, the gun lobby, the National Rifle Association, piled it on, and the bill was decimated. There is nothing in it that looks like what I described. Then it went to conference. We are supposed to work out differences between the House and the Senate in conference. They have sat on it for a year, and every day in America, 12 or 13 children are killed by guns. The same number of kids who died at Columbine die each day, not in one place but all across America. They are kidswho commit suicide. They are kids who are gang bangers shooting up innocent people. They are kids who are playing with their playmates.  The gun tragedy continues in America, and this Congress refuses to do anything. Many of us come to the floor of the Senate on a regular basis as a reminder to our colleagues in Congress that this issue will not go away because gun violence is not going away, and we need to do something to make America safer.  Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, the Democratic leadership in the Senate who supports this gun safety legislation will read some names into the Record of those who lost their lives to gun violence in the past year and will continue to do so every day the Senate is in session. In the name of those who have died and their families, we will continue this fight.  The following are the names of just some of the people killed by gunfire 1 year ago on the dates that I mention. On June 19, 1999, these were the gun victims in just some of the States and some of the cities across America:  Milton Coleman, 58, Gary, IN; Darnell Green, 28, Gary, IN; Ronald Hari, 25, Chicago, IL; David Jackson, 23, St. Louis, MO; Andre Johnson, 24, Detroit, MI; Eien Johnson, 19, Detroit, MI; Nakia Johnson, 22, Philadelphia, PA; Lewis Lackey, 47, Baltimore, MD; Malcolm Mitchell, Gary, IN; Mann Murphy, 76 Detroit, MI; Robert Rodriguez, 31, Houston TX; Donnell Roland, 20, Kansas City, MO; Denise Wojciechowski, 33, Chicago, IL; an unidentified male, 36, Long Beach, CA; another unidentified male, 53, Nashville, TN; another unidentified male, 19, Newark, NJ.  In addition, since the Senate was not in session on June 17 or June 18, I ask unanimous consent that the names of those who were killed by gunfire last year on June 17 and June 18 be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                June 17       Donald R. Gauldin, Pine Bluff, AR; Phillip Martello, 18,      New Orleans, LA; Lee Martindale, 14, St. Louis, MO; Marcus D.      Miller, 18, Chicago, IL; Larry Mitchell, 19, Dallas, TX;      Raymond Reed, 71, Charleston, SC; Molly Roberts, 15, Houston,      TX; Norberto Rodriguez, 26, San Antonio, TX; Philip M.      Spears, 51, Houston, TX; and Tony Williams, 19, Chicago, IL.                                June 18       Warren Cunningham, 33, Charlotte, NC; Barron Howe, 31,      Washington, DC; Daniel Metcalf, 31, Washington, DC; Tony      Muse, Detroit, MI; Adam W. Newton, 36, Oklahoma City, OK;      Nysia Reese, 15, Philadelphia, PA; Jeffrey Rhoads, 37, York,      PA; Coartney Robinson, 20, Dallas, TX; Debra Rogers, 45,      Dallas, TX; and Damian Santos, 20, Bridgeport, CT.
