 President, I rise today to pay tribute to oncology nurses. May is the ninth annual Oncology Nursing Month. The celebration kicks off on Thursday, May 1, 2003, on Oncology Nursing Day, during the opening ceremonies of the Oncology Nursing Society's 28th Annual Congress in Denver, CO, and continues until May 31, 2003.  Oncology Nursing Month recognizes oncology nurses, educates the public about oncology nursing, provides an opportunity for special educational events for oncology nurses, and celebrates the accomplishments of oncology nurses.  The Oncology Nursing Society, ONS, is the largest professional oncology group in the United States composed of more than 30,000 nurses and other health professionals. It exists to promote excellence in oncology nursing and the provision of quality care to those individuals affected by cancer.  As part of its mission, the society honors and maintains nursing's historical and essential commitment to advocacy for the public good. ONS was founded in 1975, and held its first Annual Congress in 1976. Since the society was established, 218 local chapters have been formed to provide a network for education and peer support at the community level.  In my State of California, there are more than 2,515 oncology nurses and health professionals who care for individuals with cancer and their families. In addition, California has 18 local Oncology Nursing Society chapters including the areas of Pacific Grove, Fresno, Brentwood, Lompoc, Simi Valley, Palm Springs, Greater Los Angeles, Redding, Sacramento, Colton, Chico, Lodi, Orange County, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa Clara, Sonoma County, and Lakewood.  Over the last 10 years, the setting where treatment for cancer is provided has changed dramatically. An estimated 80 percent of all Americans receive cancer care in community settings including cancer centers, physicians' offices, and hospital outpatient departments. Treatment regimens are as complex, if not more so, than regimens given in the inpatient setting a few short years ago.  Oncology nurses are on the frontlines of the provision of quality cancer care for individuals with cancer. Nurses are involved in the care of a cancer patient from the beginning through the end of treatment. Oncology nurses are the frontline providers of care by administering chemotherapy, managing patient therapies and sideeffects, working with insurance companies to ensure that patients receive the appropriate treatment, and providing counseling to patients and family members, in addition to many other daily acts on behalf of cancer patients.  With an increasing number of people with cancer needing high quality health care, and an inadequate supply of nurses, our Nation could well be facing a cancer care crisis of serious proportion, with limited access to quality cancer care.  I was proud to support the passage of the ``Nurse Reinvestment Act'' in the 107th Congress. This important piece of legislation expanded and implemented programs at the Health Resources Services Administration, HRSA, to address the multiple problems contributing to the nationwide nursing shortage, including the decline in nursing student enrollments, shortage of faculty, and dissatisfaction with nurse workplace environments.  I commend the Oncology Nursing Society for all of its hard work to prevent and reduce suffering from cancer and to improve the lives of those 1.3 million Americans who will be diagnosed with cancer in 2003.                          ____________________
