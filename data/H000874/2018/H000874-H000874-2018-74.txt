Speaker, they didn't vote ``present.'' I voted ``present'' because I wanted to say to the leader, Mr.Speaker, I am not going to take it or leave it.  He wants to make me look like I am not for law enforcement when I have been for law enforcement in the 50 years I have been in public office, without fail--without fail.  Mr. McCARTHY. Will the gentleman yield?
