President, I rise today to introduce the Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Leahy. This bill would reauthorize the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, which expired last September. The programs supported by this Act have provided lifesaving services and housing for America's homeless and human trafficked youth for forty years and are a vital tool in addressing the problem of homelessness among young people in our country.  Homelessness is affecting youth in unprecedented numbers. According to the Health Resources and Services Administration, there are approximately 1.6 million homeless teens in the United States. Some advocacy groups estimate that 39 percent of the homeless population is under the age of 18. Some of these youth may stay away from home for only one or two nights, while others have been living on the street for years.  Of the 1.6 million homeless youth, the National Alliance to End Homelessness estimates that, in any given year, there are approximately 550,000 unaccompanied, single youth and young adults up to age 24 who experience a homelessness episode of longer than one week. Approximately 200,000 youth each year live permanently on the street--a life that is extremely difficult, often dangerous, and unhealthy. Sadly, 5,000 teenagers are buried each year in unmarked graves either because they are unidentified or unclaimed.  Teens run away and become homeless for many reasons. A study conducted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found that 46 percent of homeless youth left home because of physical abuse and 17 percent because of sexual abuse. This population is at greater risk of suicide, unintended pregnancy, and substance abuse. Many are unable to continue with school and are more likely to enter our juvenile justice system.  As the Ranking Member of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee on Appropriations, I have made addressing homelessness a priority. Since 2010, we have seen a 16 percent drop in chronic homelessness. We must build on this success and ensure our nation's homeless youth have opportunities to succeed just as other youth. The Administration has set a goal, which I fully support, to prevent and end youth homelessness by 2020.  The programs reauthorized by this bill serve homeless youth by meetingtheir immediate needs and providing long-term residential services for youth who cannot be safely reunified with family. In 2013, 94 percent of the minors who entered Basic Center Programs exited these programs safely and appropriately, and 72 percent were reunited with their families. Similarly, 88 percent of youth in Transitional Living Programs made safe and appropriate exits.  In Portland, Maine, the Preble Street Resource Center has used Runaway and Homeless Youth Act resources to connect with youth who need food, a safe place to sleep, health services, and education support. Over 200 individual youth were served at the Joe Kreisler Teen Shelter last year, and dozens received the support they needed to return home, find independent living options, and deal with trauma, substance abuse, and mental health challenges. The Street Outreach Program allows Preble Street to operate a Drop-In center and helps caseworkers and social workers connect with youth who appear homeless or in distress. This support often translates into powerful success stories. In fact, Preble Street has seen some of its youth go on to become physicians, attorneys, film makers, and social workers.  Mr. President, homeless youth are at high risk of victimization, abuse, targeting by human traffickers, criminal activity, and death. Research shows that 40 to 60 percent of homeless youth have experienced physical abuse. Without a safe place to stay, young people suffer and remain disconnected from education, the workforce, and community involvement, and they struggle to enter adulthood successfully.  The Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act will support the critically needed services for young people who run away, are thrown out, or are disconnected from families. A caring and safe place to sleep, eat, grow, and develop is critical for all young people, and the programs reauthorized through this legislation help extend those basic services to the most vulnerable youth in our communities.  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Leahy and me in supporting this bill.                                 ______                                       By
