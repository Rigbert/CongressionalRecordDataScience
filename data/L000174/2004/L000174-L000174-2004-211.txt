President, today the Senate considers the nomination of George Schiavelli to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. He is currently of counsel at Reed Smith LLP in Los Angeles, where he has worked since 2000. Prior to joining Reed Smith, he served as a judge on the Los Angeles Superior Court from 1994-2000. He has significant litigation and judicial experience and I support his nomination.  Mr. Schiavelli's nomination is the product of a bipartisan judicial nominating commission maintained with the White House by Senators Feinstein and Boxer. The State of California is well-served by its bipartisan judicial nominating commission, which recommends qualified, moderate nominees on whom members of both parties can agree. It is difficult to understand why President Bush has opposed similar bipartisan selections commissions since they clearly help Democrats and Republicans work together to staff an independent judiciary.  I thank Senators Feinstein and Boxer for their steadfast efforts in maintaining the commission. It is a testament to their diligence that we have such well-qualified nominees heading to California's Federal courts. With this confirmation, the Senate will have confirmed 15 nominees to the district courts in California.  The Senate will now have confirmed more than two dozen judicial nominees of President Bush this year alone. Only 17 judges were confirmed under Republican leadership in the entire 1996 session and no circuit court nominees were confirmed that entire time. That was the last year in which a President was seeking reelection. We have far exceeded the number of judges confirmed, including circuit judges, that year.  With today's votes, the Senate will have confirmed nearly 200 judicial nominees of President Bush. In this Congress alone, the Senate has confirmed more Federal judges than were confirmed during the 2 full years of 1995 and 1996 when Republicans first controlled the Senate and President Clinton was in the White House. We have also exceeded the 2-year total at the end of the Clinton administration, when Republicans held the Senate majority in 1999 and 2000. I would note, however, that the Republican-controlled Senate has not confirmed in 25 months quite as many as the 100 the Democratic-led Senate confirmed in our 17 months in the majority in 2001 and 2002.  With nearly 200 confirmation of President Bush's judicial nominees, the Senate has confirmed more lifetime appointees for this President than were allowed to be confirmed in the most recent four-year presidential term--that of President Clinton from 1997 through 2000. We have confirmed more judicial nominees than the first President Bush appointed in his presidency and more than during President Reagan appointed during his entire term from 1981 through 1984.  I congratulate Mr. Schiavelli and his family on his confirmation today.                    nomination of robert b. harwell
