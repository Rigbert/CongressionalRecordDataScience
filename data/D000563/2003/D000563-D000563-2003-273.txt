President, I rise today in recognition of the 75th anniversary of the founding of Motorola, Inc., which has been a significant icon in the history of America's heritage of innovation, while continually finding new ways to make things simpler, smarter, safer, synchronized, and fun.  On September 25, 1928, Paul V. Galvin and his brother, Joseph E. Galvin, opened the Galvin Manufacturing Corporation at 847 West Harrison Street, in Chicago, Illinois, with assets of $1,315. Galvin Manufacturing Corporation entered the electronics industry as a manufacturer of household battery eliminators and grew steadily throughout the 1930s and 1940s, introducing a wide variety of devices to the electronics market.  In 1930, Galvin Manufacturing Corporation introduced the first practical, affordable and commercially successful car radio, and founder Paul V. Galvin created the brand name ``Motorola,'' linking the ideas of ``motion'' and ``sound.'' In 1936, the Police Cruiser radio receiver was Galvin Manufacturing Corporation's first entry into the new field of mobile radio communications, and in 1937, Galvin Manufacturing Corporation entered the home entertainment business with a line of phonographs and table and console radios.  Galvin Manufacturing Corporation also made significant contributions to our Nation's efforts during World War II. In 1940, Galvin Manufacturing Corporation developed the Handie-Talkie SCR536 radio, a handheld two-way radio, and provided more than 100,000 units of this crucial communications tool to the Allied Forces. In 1941, company founder Paul V. Galvin was elected president of the Radio Manufacturers Association, where he helped lead the radio industry's war efforts in the United States. Also in 1941, Galvin Manufacturing Corporation introduced its first commercial line of FM two-way radio systems and equipment, installing its first FM system in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1942, Galvin Manufacturing Corporation helped organize and lead the procurement and production of quartz radio crystals, eventually subcontracting production to more than 50 crystal manufacturers who, with Galvin Manufacturing Corporation, supplied more than 35 million radio crystals to the U.S. War Department during World War II. Later in 1942, Galvin Manufacturing Corporation received the first of five U.S. Army-Navy ``E'' Awards for excellence in production achievements during World War II, the first ever awarded to a radio manufacturer.  In 1943, Galvin Manufacturing offered its first sale of public stock, and in 1947, Galvin Manufacturing Corporation changed its name to Motorola, Inc. Motorola continued to be an innovator, by introducing technologies which have significantly impacted Americans' lives. In 1947, Motorola's first television, the Golden View model VT71, was priced to sell for under $200 and was so well-received that 100,000more units were sold in one year. In 1949, Motorola established a research and development operation in Phoenix, Arizona, to investigate the new field of solid-state technology, and by anticipating the enormous potential of the transistor, helped create the semiconductor industry and became one of the world's largest semiconductor manufacturers. In 1955, Motorola's new Handie-Talkie radio pocket pager selectively delivered a radio message to a particular individual, and pagers began to replace public announcement systems in hospitals and factories.  In 1956, Robert W. Galvin, Paul V. Galvin's son, became president of Motorola, Inc., serving the company devotedly, until his 2001 retirement. Robert W. Galvin currently serves Motorola as Chairman Emeritus.  Following the 1958 introduction of Explorer I, a 31-pound, Earth-orbiting satellite, Motorola provided radio equipment for most manned and unmanned U.S. space flights for the next 40 years. Also in 1958, Motorola introduced the Motrac radio, the first vehicular two-way radio to have a fully transistorized power supply and receiver, with such low power consumption that the radio could be used without running an automobile engine.  In 1961, Motorola developed low-cost techniques to produce silicon rectifiers used in automotive alternators, making the alternator an economical replacement for the less durable generator. In 1962, Motorola introduced the fully-transistorized Handie-Talkie HT200 portable two-way radio. In 1969, Astronaut Neil Armstrong's first words spoken from the moon were relayed to Earth by a Motorola radio transponder aboard the Apollo 11 lunar module.  In 1971, NASA's lunar roving vehicle used a Motorola FM radio receiver to provide a voice link over the 240,000 miles (386,000 km) between Earth and the moon, earning Motorola the credit for ``the first car radio on the moon.'' In 1974, Motorola's first microprocessor, the MC6800, contained 4,000 transistors and was used in automotive, computing and video game applications. In 1975, Motorola transponders were used aboard the historic Apollo-Soyuz ``Handshake in Space'' docking mission. In 1978, Motorola introduced its first computer-controlled radio systems and equipment using trunking technology to help radio operators use crowded radio frequencies more efficiently. Also in 1978, Dr. Daniel E. Noble, Motorola director emeritus and former chief scientist, was awarded the Edison Medal by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, which provided recognition from his peers for his role as a founder of the modern land mobile radio and semiconductor industries.  In 1980, Motorola was one of the first to develop computerized, electronic engine control modules that reduced fuel consumption and emissions. In 1983, the world's first commercial handheld cellular phone, the Motorola DynaTAC phone, received approval from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, culminating a 15-year, $100 million investment in the development of cellular technology. In 1984, Motorola developed the MC68HC11 8-bit embedded controller for use in everyday consumer, automotive and industrial products. In 1986, the historic Voyager airplane, the first aircraft to make a nonstop, non-refueled flight around the world, used a Motorola satellite radio. In 1987, Motorola initiated its Six Sigma Quality Initiative, which launched a global pursuit of manufacturing and other process-oriented quality initiatives and established Motorola as a role model for global corporations. In 1988, Motorola was a winner of the first Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, established by the U.S. Congress to recognize and inspire the pursuit of quality in American business. In 1989, Motorola introduced the MicroTAC personal cellular telephone, which was the smallest and lightest cellular phone on the market.  In 1990, General Instrument Corporation was the first to propose an all-digital high-definition television (HDTV) technical standard. In 1991, Robert W. Galvin, former Motorola chairman and CEO, was awarded the National Medal of Technology by President George Bush, the highest honor bestowed by the President of the United States for technological achievement, ``for advancement of the American electronics industry through continuous technological innovation, establishing Motorola as a world-class electronics manufacturer.'' In 1992, Motorola opened its first of more than 20 software centers. In 1995, Motorola developed the DragonBall MC68328 microprocessor that became widely used in consumer electronics applications, including handheld video games and personal digital assistants. In 1996, Motorola's 3.1-ounce (88 grams), StarTAC wearable cellular telephone was the world's smallest and lightest. Also in 1996, Motorola received the Albert F. Gore LifePage Achievement Award for donating 10,000 numeric pagers to patients waiting for organ transplants. Also in 1996, Motorola created the PageWriter pager, the world's first full-text two-way pager, which was selected for the permanent collections of the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. Also in 1996, Christopher B. Galvin, grandson of Motorola founder Paul V. Galvin, was elected chief executive officer of Motorola, in 1996, assuming his responsibilities in 1997. In 1998, Motorola telematics automotive technologies provided vehicle occupants with location-specific security, information and entertainment services. Also in 1998, Motorola introduced the iDEN i1000 portable radio handset that combined two-way radio, telephone, text messaging and data transmission in a single unit.  In 2000, Motorola and General Instrument Corporation merged their businesses; the largest acquisition in Motorola's history. Also in 2000, Motorola implemented the world's first commercial General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) cellular systems in the United Kingdom and Germany, providing always-on access to the Internet. Also in 2000, Motorola conducted the world's first 700MHz wideband high-speed data trial with public safety users, enabling advanced mission-critical solutions.  In 2001, Motorola introduced the i.250 wireless chipset for GSM/GPRS (Global System for Mobile Communications/General Packet Radio Service) cellular handset manufacturers. Also in 2001, Motorola's Project 25 and TETRA-compliant IP-based wireless communications systems were designed to enable public safety and first response users to transfer pictures, fingerprints, video and Internet-based data using two-way radios. Also in 2001, Motorola introduced its first metal mobile phone, the V60 phone, which a year later became available in all three cellular technologies--GSM, TDMA and CDMA--and quickly became a worldwide best seller. Also in 2001, Motorola's Broadband Communications Sector received an Emmy Award from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS) for outstanding achievement in the development of consumer digital set-top boxes, marking Motorola's seventh Emmy win.  In 2002, Motorola launched its first 3G nationwide voice and data network using Code Division Multiple Access 1X (CDMA 1X) technology with KDDI, one of Japan's largest wireless operators, enabling Internet access at speeds more than double that of existing networks. Also in 2002, the Motorola Instant GPS chip was the first single-chip Global Positioning System receiver solution, a breakthrough technology that enabled designers to add accurate location sensing features to portable consumer electronics products. Also in 2002, Motorola's Commercial, Government and Industrial Solutions Sector was honored with the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award. In 2002, Motorola had achieved $27.3 billion dollars in sales. On July 30, 2003, Motorola declared its 226th consecutive quarterly dividend.  Since 1974, Motorola has received more than 90 awards for workplace health and safety, community service and environmental stewardship from the United States Government and governments and non-government organizations worldwide. Motorola is today a global leader in wireless, automotive and broadband communications. Motorola is also a global corporate citizen dedicated to ethical business practices and pioneering important technologies that make things smarter and life better, honored traditions that began when the company was founded 75 years ago.  I would like to applaud the great impact that Motorola has had on the business, social, and cultural landscape for Americans and, indeed, citizens of all nations by virtue of its achievements throughout its remarkable 75-year tradition of delivering on the power of technology to improve the way we live. I would like to recognize that Motorola's essence as an American icon has been and continues to be to link people's dreams with technology's promise.  I congratulate Motorola on finding new ways to make things simpler, smarter, safer, synchronized and fun for people around the world. I recognize that Motorola continues to demonstrate technological leadership, the highest standards of corporate responsibility and respect for the individual, all while continuing to lead the nation and the world into our technological future. I congratulate Motorola, on the achievements of its employees, retirees, suppliers, and distributors worldwide as they commemorate and celebrate the company's 75th anniversary while the company looks to deliver an even greater impact in the 21st century as a leading force in American technology superiority.                          ____________________
