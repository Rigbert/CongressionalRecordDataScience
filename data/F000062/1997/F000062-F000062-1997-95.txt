 President, I thank the Senator from Delaware for his excellent comment. I agree with him 100 percent. This is the wrong way for the wrong reason. The reasons are regional. The reasons are, if we do not like the decision, we don't appoint the judges.  One-third of the ninth circuit today is vacant. I repeat, one-third of the judgeships on the ninth circuit today are vacant. And I do not believe that there is a plan to appoint another judge to the ninth circuit until we bow to this. What we are bowing to is something that has never been heard, never been studied in the 4\1/2\ years that I have been on the Judiciary Committee of the Senate.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a July 14, 1997 statement of the Arizona bar in opposition to this split, a statement of the California bar in objection to this, a recent letter from the Governor of the State of California in objection to this, a July 22 letter from the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee in objection to this, a letter from the chief judge of the ninth circuit in objection to this, and the chief judge's letter on the unfair allocation of judges. I also have in my files letters objecting to the earlier proposals to split the circuit. These include letters of objection from the State Bar of Nevada, the State Bar of Montana, the State Bar of Hawaii, the Los Angeles County Bar, lawyers' representatives of the ninth circuit, and the Judicial Council.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         House of Representatives,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                    Washington, DC, July 22, 1997.     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Orrin: I understand that this week the Senate is      expected to consider S. 1022, the Commerce-Justice-State-     Judiciary appropriations bill. Included in the bill is a      major piece of substantive legislation, the ``Ninth Circuit      Court of Appeals Reorganization Act of 1997.'' This provision      of the bill (section 305) would amend Title 28 of the United      States Code by dividing the existing Ninth Circuit into two      new circuits. As you well know, altering the structure of the      Federal judicial system is a serious matter. It is something      that Congress does rarely, and only after careful      consideration.       It is anticipated that an amendment will be offered to      replace the circuit division rider with legislation to create      a commission to study the courts of appeals and report      recommendations on possible change. This legislation, H.R.      908, has already passed the House unanimously on a voice vote      on June 3, 1997. A similar bill, S. 956, was passed      unanimously by the Senate in the 104th Congress. This is a      far superior way of dealing with the problems of caseload      growth in the Ninth Circuit and other courts of appeals. I      urge your support for the amendment.           Sincerely,                                                    Henry J. Hyde,     Chairman.                                  ____                                                State Capitol,                                    Sacramento, CA, July 11, 1997.     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Orrin: I have been closely following the renewed      interest in Congress over proposals to split the Ninth      Circuit. I understand that a new proposal, under      consideration by the Appropriations Committee, would split      the Ninth Circuit and divide California in half between the      resulting circuits. I am writing to register my strong      opposition to the passage of any such measure prior to such      time that an objective study is commissioned and issued      addressing the many, serious ramifications of such a split.       As you may know, I have been on record in opposition to      previous proposals to split the Ninth Circuit on the grounds      that they were a form of judicial gerrymandering which sought      to cordon off some judges and keep others.       However, the present proposal to split California between      two circuits would not only amount to judicial gerrymandering      but would invite forum shopping of the rankest kind.      California would face the unprecedented prospect of a      ``circuit split'' on a question of law within the same state,      which would invite lawyers to ``forum shop'' between the two      resulting halves of California on the basis of which law is      more favorable to their position. This would be particularly      frustrating for State government, where     legal challenges to its actions may generally be brought in      any venue within the State.       While a split of the Ninth Circuit would generate a number      of inconsistent rulings along the West Coast in areas such as      commercial law, environmental law (including standing to      sue), and admiralty law, a split of California would      exacerbate this inconsistency by subjecting Northern      California's cities, like San Francisco, to different      controlling law than Southern California's cities, like Los      Angeles.       Nor would the spectacle of forum shopping between circuits      within California be alleviated by a mechanism similar to      that proposed in a 1993 House bill (H.R. 3654), which      suggested the creation of an ``Intercircuit California En      Banc Court.'' As proposed in that bill, the Intercircuit      California Court would permit en banc review by judges of      different circuits ``whose official duty stations are in the      State of California.'' Such an intercircuit en banc panel      would necessarily differ from the composition of the en banc      panels for each of the participating circuits. This, of      course, raises the specter of greater inconsistencies among      the circuits arising from overlapping en banc panels. As the      proposal would permit the Intercircuit Court to resolve only      intercircuit conflicts of federal law, conflicting      interpretations of California substantive law arising in      diversity cases would presumably remain unresolved. Of      course, these additional circuits would impose additional      burdens on the U.S. Supreme Court.       Admittedly, the Ninth Circuit handles more cases than any      other circuit. However, statistics refute any objection that      the Circuit is ``too big.'' The median time for it to decide      appeals (14.3 months as of September 30, 1995) is less than      that for the Eleventh Circuit (15.1 months), and only      slightly higher than that for the Sixth, Seventh and District      of Columbia Circuits.       The real issue underlying this debate appears to be one of      judicial gerrymandering, which seeks to cordon off some      judges in one circuit while keeping others in another because      of concerns, whether perceived or real, over particular      judges' perspectives or judicial philosophy. If this is the      issue, I submit that the proper means to address it is      through the appointment of judges who share our judicial      philosophy that judges should not make policy judgments, but      should interpret the law based on the purposes of the statute      as expressed in its language, and who respect the role of the      states in our federal system.       I urge you to discourage your colleagues from approving any      proposed split of the Ninth Circuit, and particularly one      that splits California, until such time as a study is issued      that carefully examines the implications of this significant      issue. I would be pleased to contribute one or more      representatives to assist with such a study.           Sincerely,                                                      Pete Wilson,     Governor.                                  ____                                                     The State Bar                                                of California,                                 San Francisco, CA, July 14, 1997.     Re State Bar of California Support for Commission to Study          the Federal Courts of Appeals and Opposition to Splitting          the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: The Board of Governors of the State      Bar of California strongly opposes the recent proposals to      split the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. We support the      establishment of a non-partisan commission to study the      structure and alignment of the federal courts of appeals. A      bill to establish such a commission, H.R. 908, unanimously      passed the House in June. It has been 24 years since the last      major study of the structure and alignment of the federal      courts of appeals was conducted. No proposal to restructure      the Ninth Circuit should be considered prior to the      completion of a thorough study.       Some have argued that the size of the caseload of the Ninth      Circuit argues for its division; however, caseload growth is      an issue common to courts of appeals nationwide. Splitting      the Ninth Circuit, ostensibly because of its caseload, before      considering how to respond to growing caseloads nationwide,      will complicate rather than advance solutions to caseload      growth. Furthermore, repeated division of circuits in      response to growth is likely to create a proliferation of      balkanized circuits.       We have heard that various proposals to split the Ninth      Circuit may be made in the Senate Appropriations Committee,      for example, to include California and Nevada in one circuit      and to join other states in the Continental United States in      another circuit, including non-contiguous Arizona; or to      place California in a single circuit with the island      territories, with all other states presently in the Ninth      Circuit in a separate circuit. The variety of proposals      indicates that there is no consensus, even among proponents,      as to how any split should be achieved.       We are strongly opposed to all of these proposals to split      the Ninth Circuit. They represent a form of judicial      gerrymandering and are not based upon any study of the Ninth      Circuit or of the overall needs of the federal courts of      appeals. They violate the established principles that federal      judicial circuits encompass three or more states and be      designed to transcend parochial interests. These proposals      are likely to increase the problems of the federal courts of      appeals and make these problems more costly and difficult to      fix. The multiplicity of proposals that have been made,      without study, simply emphasize the need for a thorough study      of the federal appellate courts as a whole.       For these reasons, we believe that any proposal to split      the Ninth Circuit, or to realign any other circuit, needs to      be informed by a non-partisan study of the structure and      alignment of the federal courts of appeal.       I have written a similar letter to Senator Boxer, who is a      member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.           Sincerely,                                               Thomas G. Stolpman,     President.                                  ____                                         State Bar of Arizona,                                       Phoenix, AZ, July 14, 1997.     Hon. Orrin Hatch,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Hatch: This letter is simply to confirm that      the State Bar of Arizona has repeatedly opposed any division      of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and supports the      House's proposal for a study commission.           Sincerely,                                                       Don Bivens,     President-Elect.                                  ____                                             United States Courts,                                        For the Ninth Circuit,                                          Reno, NV, July 23, 1997.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senator,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: This afternoon we had a meeting of      the active and senior judges of the Ninth Circuit Court of      Appeals, for the sole purpose of discussing the current      efforts underway by the Senate Appropriations Committee to      split the Ninth Circuit. After a thorough discussion, the      judges voted overwhelmingly to support the creation of a      study commission to study the structure of the circuits.       Altering the structure of the federal judiciary system is      an extremely serious matter, something that should be done      rarely and only after careful, serious study and      consideration.       We strongly urge the members of the Senate to support the      creation of a commission to conduct a thoughtful, thorough      and complete study of the matter.       Our court asked me to convey to you our appreciation for      your continued leadership in this matter.           Yours sincerely,                                                 Procter Hug, Jr.,     Chief Judge.                                  ____                                              United States Courts                                        For the Ninth Circuit,                                          Reno, NV, July 18, 1997.     Hon. Harry M. Reid,     U.S. Senator,     Washington, DC.       Dear Harry: After reviewing this matter yet again, I have      some possible arguments for the floor of the Senate, giving      examples of why this is a hasty and ill-considered bill and      why a Commission should study such an important issue.       1. Under the bill, the Ninth Circuit is to have fifteen      judges and the Twelfth Circuit is to have thirteen judges.      The Ninth Circuit would have a 50% greater caseload per judge      than the Twelfth Circuit.States:                                                         Filings    California....................................................4,840    Nevada..........................................................500    Guam.............................................................87    Northern Marianas................................................21                                                               ________                                                                     Total.......................................................5,448                                                               ========With 15 judges, the caseload per judge..............................363                                                               ========    Alaska..........................................................204    Arizona.........................................................891    Hawaii..........................................................204    Idaho...........................................................141    Montana.........................................................175    Oregon..........................................................626    Washington......................................................871                                                               ________                                                                     Total.......................................................3,112                                                               ========With 13 judges, the caseload per judge..............................239       The caseload per judge in the Ninth Circuit would be 124      cases per judge higher than the Twelfth Circuit, or 52%      greater than the Twelfth.       2. The provision in the bill for co-equal clerks in the      Twelfth Circuit is completely unworkable. How can it be      efficiently administered in this way? Is the administration      of the circuit to be done in two separate co-equal      headquarters? Where would the Circuit Executive be located?       3. Consider the travel time and expense of the judges.      Presumably, the judges from Alaska and Montana will half the      time travel to Phoenix, and the Arizona judges will half the      time travel to Seattle. Presently, the circuit headquarters      in San Francisco is equidistant and air routes convenient.      This would not be the case in the new Twelfth Circuit.       Harry, I suggest these arguments be saved for the floor to      avoid changes or arguments prepared to meet them.           Yours Sincerely,                                                 Procter Hug, Jr.,     Chief Judge.                                  ____                   Statement of Administration Policy                      The Judiciary: Ninth Circuit       The Administration opposes the provision in the Committee      bill that would reorganize     the Ninth Circuit by splitting it into two separate circuits.      We understand that other substantive amendments to divide the      Ninth Circuit may be offered on the Senate Floor. The      Administration strongly objects to using the appropriations      process to legislate on this important matter. The division      of the Ninth Circuit is an important issue not just for the      bench and the bar of the affected region, but also for the      citizens of the Ninth Circuit. The Administration believes      that a much better approach would be passage of legislation,      H.R. 908--already passed by the House and currently pending      at the desk in the Senate--that would create a bipartisan      commission to study this difficult and complex question and      make recommendations to the Congress within a date certain.      This would allow for substantive resolution of the issue in a      deliberative manner, allowing all affected parties to voice      their views.
