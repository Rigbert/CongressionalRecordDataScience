Speaker, Speaker Gingrich has said that his multimillion dollar book deal was ``like winning the lottery.'' Well, not quite, Mr. Speaker. Your lottery was no game of chance. You see, Mr. Speaker, you were [[Page H236]] the only one holding a lottery ticket. And in addition, your lottery price was being decided by Rupert Murdoch and his publishing empire, a man who has extensive issues pending before Federal agencies.  This morning's Washington Post reported that many publishing companies refused to bid on the Speaker's book contract when Mr. Murdoch raised the offer into the millions of dollars.  The Republicans and Speaker Gingrich have promised us new openness in dealing with the House of Representatives and politics in Washington. Let us start with openness and full disclosure on this multimillion dollar book deal. It is time for the Speaker to not only release the contract, but to come clean with the American people about all the circumstances surrounding it.                          ____________________
