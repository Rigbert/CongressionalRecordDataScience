President, as a supporter of the development of renewable energy in this country, and in the Northwest in particular, I am pleased to see our region taking a leadership role in developing renewable energy resources.  Several years ago, two forward thinking utilities in the Northwest, along with the Bonneville Power Association, initiated an effort to site and permit a new wind project in Carbon County, WY. The focus of the project was to test a new generation of technology in Northwest climates, and develop capability and experience with a resource which the region has in abundance. Despite considerable changes in the electricity market, and challenges presented by the project, these three utilities persevered and made thisproject a reality. PacificCorp., the Eugene Water and Electric Board, and the Bonneville Power Administration demonstrated great leadership to create the first new commercial-scale wind project to serve the Northwest. Their commitment marks the dawn of a new industry for the Northwest, and a substantial contribution to a sustainable future for us and our children.  Three individuals deserve special recognition in this effort: Dennis Steinberg of PacifiCorp., Ken Beeson of the Eugene Water and Electric Board, and George Darr of the Bonneville Power Administration. I thank them for their dedication and hard work in bringing this project to fruition.                          ____________________
