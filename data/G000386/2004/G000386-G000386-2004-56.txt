 President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator Murkowski in sponsoring a resolution commemorating the annual ``Red Ribbon Week.'' Celebrated October 23-31, Red Ribbon Week encourages individuals, families, and communities to take a stand against alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drug use. I hope the rest of the Senate will join in supporting this resolution and support this very important campaign.  The tradition of Red Ribbon Week and wearing and displaying red ribbons started back in 1985 following the assassination of U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency Special Agent Enrique Camarena. In an effort to honor his memory and unite in the battle against illegal drugs, friends, neighbors and students from his home town began wearing red ribbons. In 1988 the National Family Partnership took the celebration nationwide. Since then, the Red Ribbon campaign has reached millions of children, families and communities across the country, spreading the message about the destructive effects of drugs.  In my State of Iowa, this year's theme for Red Ribbon Week is ``Take a Stand--Help Iowa Be Drug Free.'' Schools and community groups across the State are organizing a variety of activities including pledges, contests, workshops, rallies, theatrical and musical performances, and other family and educational events all designed to educate our children on the negative effects of drugs and promote a drug-free environment.  Research tells us that if you can keep a child drug-free until they turn 20, chances are very slim that they will ever try or become addicted. This is why it is so important to maintain a coherent anti-drug message that begins early in adolescence and continues throughout the growing years. Such an effort must engage parents, communities, and young people. Red Ribbon week provides each of us the opportunity to take a stand by helping our children make the right decisions when it comes to drugs.  More than 80 million people across the country are expected to participate in Red Ribbon Week. I urge my colleagues to join us in passing this resolution to demonstrate our commitment to raising awareness about drugs and encourage everyone to make healthy choices.                          ____________________
