President, let's be factual here. The suggestion was made by the Senator from Vermont that we have an order of speakers on both sides. These would be Senators who have amendments that they want to offer. They would discuss them on the floor with the idea that perhaps a bipartisan group could meet after the caucus meetings and talk about how we might sequence the amendments. I would note, however, for the Senators here, the meeting after the caucus was a closed-door meeting to which only Republicans were invited.  It is somewhat difficult to schedule Republican or Democratic amendments in such a meeting. This one-sided meeting was completely different than the business meetings the Senator from Pennsylvania held in the Judiciary Committee, which were successful in getting a bill to the floor.  I urge the Republican and Democratic leaders to look at the model followed by the Senator from Pennsylvania in committee, which reported a bill to the floor.
