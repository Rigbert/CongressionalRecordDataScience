Chairman, I would just like to emphasize the gentleman has been a real leader in the unfunded mandates effort several Congresses ago when it was not popular, and now when it is, and his efforts to put an office of risk assessment within the Department of Agriculture was a real initiative, a real reform effort in the Committee on Agriculture during the last session.  Unfortunately, because of the budget pressures, it was not funded. We need this money. It is a good effort and I commend the gentleman and I support the amendment wholeheartedly.    amendment offered by mr. skeen as a substitute for the amendment                          offered by mr. condit
