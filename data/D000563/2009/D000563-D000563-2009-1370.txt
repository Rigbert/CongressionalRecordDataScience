In America we don't say ``buyer beware'' when it comes to lead paint in toys or risky drugs. But when Americans purchase financial products such as mortgages or credit cards, they often have little idea whether those products --and the mountain of fine print that come with them--are good for their families. Why?  The answer is that consumer products are subject to oversight, while financial products are not. Professor Elizabeth Warren, Chairperson of the Congressional Oversight Panel for the $700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program, was right when she said ``we need more oversight.'' That was more than a year ago.  Today there are no fewer than 10 Federal regulators with responsibility for consumer protections from predatory or deceptive financial products, but none have oversight as its primary objective.  The legislation that I am introducing today with Senators Schumer and Kennedy would create a Financial Product Safety Commission that would focus exclusively on the interests of consumers. I am pleased that Congressmen Bill Delahunt and Brad Miller will be introducing the House companion.  The objectives of the Financial Product Safety Commission would be to reduce consumer risk in using financial products, coordinate enforcement with other Federal and State regulators, and report to the public regarding the state of consumer financial product safety.  The Financial Product Safety Commission would fulfill that mission by preventing predatory and deceptive financial practices, educating consumers on the responsible use of financial products and services, establishing a regulatory floor beneath which consumer financial product safety could not fall, and recommending the steps that should be taken to improve the value of financial products for consumers.  The bill is supported by over 55 national and State organizations, including Consumer Federation of America, Center for Responsible Lending Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, NAACP, La Raza, AFL-CIO, SEIU, National Consumer Law Center, Consumers Union, Public Citizen, and U.S. PIRG. I include a statement of support for the Record.  As Congress embarks on financial regulatory reform, our improved regulatory system must focus not just on the safety and soundness of the providers of financial products but also on the safety of the consumers of financial products. The Financial Product Safety Commission will do just that.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and supporting material be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 566       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Congress finds that--       (1) the Nation's multiagency financial services regulatory      structure has created a dispersion of regulatory      responsibility, which in turn has led to an inadequate focus      on protecting consumers from inappropriate consumer financial      products and practices;       (2) the absence of appropriate oversight has allowed      excessively costly or predatory consumer financial products      and practices to flourish; and       (3) the creation of a regulator whose sole focus is the      safety of consumer financial products would help address this      lack of consumer protection.     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

(b) Responsibilities.--The Commission shall--       (1) promulgate consumer financial product safety rules      that--       (A) ban abusive, fraudulent, unfair, deceptive, predatory,      anticompetitive, or otherwise anticonsumer practices,      products, or product features;       (B) place reasonable restrictions on consumer financial      products, practices, or product features to reduce the      likelihood that they may be provided in a manner that is      inconsistent with the objectives specified in subsection (a);      and       (C) establish requirements for such clear and adequate      warnings or other information, and the form and manner of      delivery of such warnings or other information, as may be      appropriate to advance the objectives specified in subsection      (a);       (2) establish and maintain a best practices guide for all      providers of consumer financial products;       (3) conduct such continuing studies and investigations of      consumer financial products industry practices as it      determines necessary;       (4) award grants or enter into contracts for the conduct of      such studies and investigations with any person (including a      governmental entity), as necessary to advance the objectives      specified in subsection (a);       (5) following publication of a rule, assist public and      private organizations or groups of consumer financial product      providers, administratively and technically, in the      development of safety standards or guidelines that would      assist such providers in complying with such rule;       (6) comment on selected rulemakings of agencies designated      in section 6(d) affecting consumer financial products; and       (7) establish and operate a consumer financial product      customer hotline which consumers can call to register      complaints and receive information on how to combat      anticonsumer products or practices.

For purposes of this section, a State law      is not inconsistent with this Act or a consumer financial      product safety rule, or the purposes of the Act or rule, if      the protection afforded by such State law to any consumer is      greater than the protection provided by the consumer      financial product safety rule or this Act. Nothing in this      Act or any rule promulgated under this Act precludes any      remedy under State law to or on behalf of a consumer.       (b) Programs To Promote Federal-State Cooperation.--       (1) In general.--The Commission shall establish a program      to promote cooperation between the Federal Government and      State governments for purposes of carrying out this Act.

(c) Cooperation of Federal Departments and Agencies.--The      Commission may obtain from any Federal department or agency      such statistics, data, program reports, and other materials      as it may determine necessary to carry out its functions      under this Act. Each such department or agency shall      cooperate with the Commission and, to the extent permitted by      law, furnish such materials to the Commission. The Commission      and the heads of other departments and agencies engaged in      administering programs relating to consumer financial product      safety shall, to the maximum extent practicable, cooperate      and consult in order to ensure fully coordinated efforts.     SEC. 9. PROHIBITED ACTS.

SEC. 10. ENFORCEMENT.       (a) Criminal Penalties.--       (1) Knowing and willful violations.--Any person who      knowingly and willfully violates section 9 shall be fined not      more than $500,000, imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both      for each such violation.       (2) Executives and agents.--Any individual director,      officer, or agent of a business entity who knowingly and      willfully authorizes, orders, or performs any of the acts or      practices constituting in whole or in part a violation of      section 9 shall be subject to penalties under this section,      without regard to any penalties to which that person may be      otherwise subject.       (b) Civil Penalties.--       (1) In general.--Any person who violates section 9 shall be      subject to a civil penalty in an amount established under      paragraph (2). A violation of section 9 shall constitute a      separate civil offense with respect to each consumer      financial product transaction involved.       (2) Publication of schedule of penalties.--Not later than      December 1, 2009, and December 1 of each fifth year      thereafter, the Commission shall prescribe and publish in the      Federal Register a schedule of the maximum authorized civil      penalty that shall apply for any violation of section 9 that      occurs on or after January 1 of the year immediately      following the date of such publication.       (3) Relevant factors in determining amount of penalty.--In      determining the amount of any civil penalty in an action for      a violation of section 9, the Commission--       (A) shall consider--       (i) the nature of the consumer financial product;       (ii) the severity of the unreasonable risk to the consumer;       (iii) the number of products or services sold or      distributed;       (iv) the occurrence or absence of consumer injury; and       (v) the appropriateness of such penalty in relation to the      size of the business of the person charged; and       (B) shall ensure that penalties in each case are sufficient      to induce compliance by all regulated entities.       (4) Compromise of penalty; deductions from penalty.--       (A) In general.--Any civil penalty under this section may      be compromised by the Commission.       (B) Considerations.--In determining the amount of such      penalty or whether it should be remitted or mitigated and in      what amount, the Commission--       (i) shall consider--       (I) the nature of the consumer financial product;       (II) the severity of the unreasonable risk to the consumer;       (III) the number of offending products or services sold;       (IV) the occurrence or absence of consumer injury; and       (V) the appropriateness of such penalty to the size of the      business of the person charged; and       (ii) shall ensure that compromise penalties remain      sufficient to induce compliance by all regulated entities.       (C) Amount.--The amount of a penalty compromised under this      paragraph, when finally determined, or the amount agreed on      compromise, may be deducted from any sums owing by the United      States to the person charged.       (c) Collection and Use of Penalties.--       (1) Establishment of fund.--There is established within the      Treasury of the United States a fund, into which shall be      deposited all criminal and civil penalties collected under      this section.       (2) Use of fund.--The fund established under this      subsection shall be used to defray the costs of the      operations of the Commission or, where appropriate, provide      restitution to harmed consumers.       (d) Private Enforcement.--       (1) In general.--A person may bring a civil action for a      violation of section 9 for equitable relief and other charges      and costs in an amount equal to the sum of--       (A) any actual damages sustained by such person as a result      of such violation, if actual damages resulted;       (B) twice the amount of any finance charge in connection      with the transaction, except that such liability shall not be      less than $1,000, such minimum to be adjusted on an annual      basis by the Commission based upon the consumer price index;      and       (C) reasonable attorney fees and costs.       (e) Jurisdiction.--       (1) In general.--Any action under this Act may be brought      in any appropriate United     States district court, or in any other court of competent      jurisdiction, not later than 2 years after the date of the      discovery of the violation.       (2) Rules of construction.--This section does not bar a      person from asserting a violation of this Act in an action to      collect a debt, or if foreclosure has been initiated, as a      matter of defense by recoupment or set-off. An action under      this Act shall not be the basis for removal of an action to a      United States district court.

(f) State Actions for Violations.--       (1) Authority of states.--In addition to such other      remedies as are provided under State law, if the chief law      enforcement officer of a State, or an official or agency      designated by a State, has reason to believe that any person      has violated or is violating section 9, the State--       (A) may bring an action to enjoin such violation in any      appropriate United States district court or in any other      court of competent jurisdiction;       (B) may bring an action on behalf of the residents of the      State to recover--       (i) damages for which the person is liable to such      residents under subsection (d) as a result of the violation;      and       (ii) civil penalties, as established under subsection (b);      and       (C) in the case of any successful action under subparagraph      (A) or (B), shall be awarded the costs of the action and      reasonable attorney fees, as determined by the court.       (2) Rights of federal regulators.--       (A) Notice of state action.--A State shall serve prior      written notice of any action under paragraph (1) upon the      Commission and provide the Commission with a copy of its      complaint, except in any case in which such prior notice is      not feasible, in which case the State shall serve such notice      immediately upon instituting such action.       (B) Commission authorization.--Upon notice of an action      under subparagraph (A), the Commission shall have the right--       (i) to intervene in the action;       (ii) upon so intervening, to be heard on all matters      arising therein;       (iii) to remove the action to the appropriate United States      district court; and       (iv) to file petitions for appeal.

(4) Limitation on state action while federal action      pending.--If the Commission has instituted a civil action or      an administrative action for a violation of section 9, a      State may not, during the pendency of such action, bring an      action under this section against any defendant named in the      complaint of the Commission for any violation of section 9      that is alleged in that complaint.     SEC. 11. REPORTS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to the Commission      for purposes of carrying out this Act such sums as may be      necessary.                                  ____  56 Diverse National, State Organizations Support Financial Product                            Safety Commission     Hon. Richard J. Durbin     Majority Whip, U.S. Senate     Washington, DC.     Hon. William Delahunt     House of Representatives     Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles Schumer     U.S. Senate     Washington, DC.     Hon. Brad Miller     House of Representatives     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Durbin and Schumer and Representatives      Delahunt and Miller: The undersigned organizations strongly      support your legislation to create a federal Financial      Product Safety Commission (FPSC) that would ensure the      fairness, safety and sustainability of credit and payment      products. It is now widely accepted that the current      international economic crisis was triggered by the failure of      federal regulators to stop abusive lending, particularly in      the housing sector. By creating a separate agency focused      exclusively on credit safety, your legislation will not only      better protect consumers, but the entire economy.       Under this legislation, the FPSC would be empowered to      ensure that credit and payment products do not have predatory      or deceptive features that can harm consumers or lock them      into unaffordable loans, such as pre-payment penalties,      unjustified fees, or hair-trigger interest rate increases.      The agency would also conduct ongoing research and      investigation into credit industry products and services. In      addition, it would provide consumers with high-quality      information about how to avoid abusive lending or credit      problems. This approach offers two crucial improvements over      the current splintered, ineffectual regulatory system:       A FPSC would put consumer protection first. Federal      regulatory agencies have often treated consumer protection as      less important than or even in conflict with their mission to      ensure the safety and soundness of financial institutions. In      addition, the independence of regulators like the Office of      the Comptroller of the Currency and Office of Thrift      Supervision has been threatened because they are directly and      almost entirely funded by the institutions they oversee. As a      result, federal agencies dithered for years in implementing      regulations to stop unfair and deceptive mortgage and credit      card lending practices, finally producing only after the      current foreclosure and consumer debt crisis took hold.      Regulators have left other types of dangerous products      completely untouched, such as high-cost ``overdraft'' loans      that are triggered without consumer permission. The FPSC      would be required to make consumer protection its top      priority, which will also better ensure the soundness of      financial institutions.       A FPSC would stop regulatory agencies from competing among      themselves to lower standards. Right now, financial      institutions freely switch charters between federal and state      regulation, and between various federal charters, in order      to reduce the level of oversight and the costs associated      with it. Under a FPSC, regulated institutions could not      choose the agency that regulates them. The FPSC would be      empowered to establish federal minimum standards for all      credit products and the institutions that offer them, so      that competition between state and federal regulators      would only exist to improve the quality of consumer      protection.       Unless the structure of financial services regulation is      realigned to change not just the focus of regulation but its      underlying philosophy, it is unlikely that consumers will be      adequately protected from unfair or dangerous credit products      in the future. The ultimate result of this crucial      legislation would be an agency designed to protect consumers      from the corrosive effects of unsafe credit, which has a      regulatory perspective that is truly independent of the      institutions it regulates. Just as importantly, this agency      would not be under constant pressure to keep protection      standards low. You have created a template for regulatory      modernization that will protect consumers, financial      institutions and the economy for years to come.       We applaud your leadership on this issue and look forward      to working with you to enact this proposal.           Sincerely,       Gregory L.
