BOXER. That is absolutely correct. Let me reiterate what I said. In cases all across this country, there have been settlements in seven different States, and $5 billion has been collected from the oil companies in these settlements. Now, if the oil companies had such clean hands and they were paying their fair amount of royalties, I assure my friend they would not part with $5 billion--I didn't say million, I said $5 billion. I don't even know what $5 billion looks like in a room. All I can say to my friend is, it is more than we spend on Head Start in a year.
