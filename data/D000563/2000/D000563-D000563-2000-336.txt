This is a critically important issue in the Midwest. It is certainly an important issue in the State of Illinois. I have been back to my State and I can tell you virtually every single group I have met with--labor, business, education, ordinary families--all bring up this issue as the first concern because it hits them in the pocketbook. Families trying to drive back and forth to a job, small businesses that depend on the cost of fuel for profit--they are all concerned. I commend the Senator from Michigan for the comments he has made.  I have listened to the oil companies and their explanations about why these prices have gone up, but I have to tell you they just don't wash. They don't make sense. When you explore them and look to them you say: Sure, that might account for a 2-cent increase or a 5-cent increase. But in the Chicagoland area, it is not uncommon to find gasoline at $2.29 a gallon and higher, for the lowest cost gasoline. That does not explain it away.  Frankly, I think the oil companies are coming up with excuses. In the past, they have come up with excuses and, frankly, we have to go further. I think the Senator from Michigan is correct; the Federal Trade Commission has a responsibility here. Next Tuesday, the chairman of that Commission is going to meet with the Illinois delegation to talk about this. I hope they take the Senator's suggestion and go forward with this investigation. At this time I think we need to have the oil companies in for honest answers so families and businesses across America understand what is behind this.  I commend the Senator from Michigan, as well as the Senator from Maine, and all those who have shown leadership on this issue. It is really a matter of the quality of life for a lot of families and businesses in the Midwest--across the Nation.
