Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Ralph Stanley. Mr. Stanley recently passed away, leaving behind him a legacy of outstanding public and private sector work in the transportation arena. Throughout his career Mr. Stanley established, among other things, a true expertise for mass transit projects.  Mr. Stanley was a graduate of Princeton University and Georgetown University Law School.  He joined the Transportation Department in 1981, serving as chief of staff to Transportation Department Secretaries Drew Lewis and Elizabeth Dole. He then served as the chief of the U.S. Urban Mass Transportation Administration for four years. During this time I worked closely with Mr. Stanley, particularly in the expansion of Metro for the Washington Metropolitan area. Had it not been for our working relationship, the vast system of public transportation we all enjoy today would not have been possible.  Mr. Stanley found the Virginia Toll Road Corporation in 1988 and spent four years as chief executive. In 1992, he became vice president for infrastructure and development for Bechtel. While at Bechtel, Mr. Stanley helped direct the expansion of the light rail transit system in Portland, Oregon, as well as the economic development of the land near the rail expansion.  Mr. Speaker, although Mr. Stanley and I did not always find ourselves on the same side of public policy issues, he was fair, forward looking and supportive of the transportation projects on which we worked together. Mr. Stanley was dedicated to create a better and more efficient transportation system for that we are grateful.                          ____________________
