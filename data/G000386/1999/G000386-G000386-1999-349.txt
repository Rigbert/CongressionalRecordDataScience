 I know that the subcommittee has allotted the Drug Enforcement Agency the tools it needs to properly wage the war on illegal drugs. I also know that the subcommittee has added personnel and resources to the western and central regions of the United States to focus primarily on the methamphetamine problems in those geographic regions of the country. However, as you may know, methamphetamine abuse and production across the United States has forced law enforcement agencies to address challenges that exceed the many years of experience of the State and local law enforcement personnel within such agencies. Methamphetamine affects smaller communities and rural areas disproportionately. In many cases, these communities lack the investigative and technical skills, and resources to confront major criminal gangs or the environmental hazards caused by meth product.
