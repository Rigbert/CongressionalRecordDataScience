Speaker, I submit the following article to be included in the Record:                [From the New York Times, Jan. 30, 2003]     What the World Hears When the President Speaks; Calming Fears                            (By Bill Emmott)       Before President Bush's State of the Union address, worry      about war and suspicion of America were the prevailing views      in the outside world. After his address, worry and suspicion      still prevail. But there is now hope that the suspicion, at      least, could soon ease.       Don't misunderstand. I have long supported America's effort      to enforce the United Nations resolutions calling on Saddam      Hussein to disarm, and have felt that only under an ever-     nearing threat of war was there any chance that this might be      achieved, peacefully or otherwise. Few of my fellow Europeans      (and surprisingly few Britons) have felt the same. Every time      they have seen Mr. Bush speaking informally about this issue,      their fears and suspicions have grown. However, every time      they have seen him make a big, formal speech (as at the      United Nations in September and before Congress on Tuesday)      they have felt reassured.       This time, the reassurance did not come from his      deliberately reassuring gestures, such as the promise to put      up $15 billion to combat H.I.V. and AIDS in Africa and the      Caribbean or the $1.2 billion for research into pollution-     free cars. It came from his announcement that on Feb. 5      Secretary of State Colin Powell would reveal evidence of      Iraq's weapons concealment to the Security Council.       It was reassuring because it suggests that some proof      exists. Admittedly, the lust for evidence represents a sort      of mass self-delusion, a belief that somehow the 1990's      didn't happen and that no weapons programs were found then.      It also represents topsy-turvy thinking: that the burden of      proof is on Mr. Bush, not Saddam Hussein. Still, such      thinking is a reality that the White House needs to face.       Such evidence is not needed on technical, moral or legal      grounds. But it is needed to secure a broad coalition, which      in turn is highly desirable if the risks of war--and an      unstable aftermath of war--are to be reduced. At least from      this vantage point in London, the recent opposition to war      heard from France and Russia looks shallow. Some credible,      publicly usable evidence is all that is needed for them to be      able to back a second United Nations resolution and even to      offer military support.       Following President Bush's address, therefore, an extremely      favorable situation looks to be within America's grasp--a      broad coalition and a second resolution, both just at the      time when the military buildup is reaching its peak. Saddam      Hussein, no doubt, will have fresh delaying tactics up his      sleeve, such as apparent, partial admissions or concessions      about weapons programs with which he will hope to sow new      divisions and confusion. The wider the coalition against him,      and the shorter the time he has available, the lower will be      his chances of success.  The president's speech brought that prospect closer. Now Colin Powell must clinch it.                          ____________________
