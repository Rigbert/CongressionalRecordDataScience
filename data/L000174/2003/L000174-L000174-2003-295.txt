President, I rise to engage the chairman and Senator Dorgan in a colloquy concerning the Rebuild America Program at the Department of Energy. The events of August have dramatically shown all of us that we need to take immediate steps to increase the reliability of our electricity grid. In Vermont, we came very close to being swept up in the blackout cascade. Our transmission grid is under increasing demand pressure. Although there are several proposals to upgrade the transmission grid, everyone recognizes that the only action we can take immediately is energy conservation. This is why I strongly support the Rebuild America Program to help bring emerging technologies to our States to improve energy efficiency in buildings. I would like to work with the chairman and Senator Dorgan to increase funding for this program to bring it closer to the Fiscal Year 2003 level.
