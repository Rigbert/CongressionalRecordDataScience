 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a dear friend, a beloved family man, a successful business man, and a treasure to the State of Alabama. Winton `Red' Blount, a native of Union Springs, AL passed on October 24, 2002. He was one of those people who everyone should emulate, because he took advantage of everything life had to offer--having a loving family, running a successful business, standing up for justice during the Civil Rights movement, enjoying the arts,and pursuing civil service. It is my hope, that in this tribute, I can draw a bit of a picture to describe the kind of life that Red Blount lived.  During the 1960s civil rights movements, the State of Alabama was home to some tumultuous times. When Governor George Wallace blocked integration into the University of Alabama, Red Blount calmly and constructively worked with U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy and Governor Wallace to keep the peace and allow African-American students into the University. Blount, at that time, served as a member of the University's Board of Trustees, and, more importantly, served as a voice of reason during a time when reasonable voices were few and far between.  As a businessman, Blount was straight-forward, hard working, and honest in his practices. He founded Blount Brothers and quickly developed a reputation for delivering products on time and without unexpected costs. Blount's company can be credited with building the launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, FL, which sent the first space flight to the moon. Blount Brothers also built the Nation's first ballistic missile site, the New Orleans Superdome, and international projects including King Saud University, near Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  Since I can remember, Red was a dedicated civil servant and a devoted member of the Republican Party. Known as Mr. Republican, he wanted to make a difference in Alabama and across the Nation. In 1960, Red headed up then-Vice President Richard Nixon's unsuccessful bid for the presidency as his southeastern campaign chairman. In 1968, Red became president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and then he went on to serve as President Richard Nixon's Postmaster General. In this capacity, he advocated for and implemented massive reform, making the postal service less political and more efficient. Red even threw his hat into the ring for a bid to the U.S. Senate in 1972. Unfortunately, he lost, but there is no question that he would've made a great Senator.  Among Red Blount's many business and political achievements, having a family was his most important accomplishment. His five children are grown and successful in their own right, and there is no question that Blount instilled a strong work ethic into them and fostered their ability to succeed in whatever they chose to do. Blount's family expanded when he married his second wife, Carolyn Self Varner Blount, and he became step father to her two children. They enjoyed gathering at the holidays with all the children and grandchildren in the extended Blount family.  One of the things that Alabamians will remember most about Red Blount was his love of the arts. In 1982, Red discovered that the Alabama Shakespeare Festival, of which his wife, Carolyn served on the board, was very much in debt. He was able to assist them with their financial difficulties by building a theater on the 250-acre grounds behind his home. This became Montgomery's Blount Cultural Park, and the theater was named for his wife.  The theater grew with the support of State grants, but mostly because of the investment that Red and Carolyn made in it. They made nearly $15 million in donations of art work, which encouraged the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts, which was looking to change locations, to move to the park grounds. The park continued to grow with gardens and an amphitheater, and Blount expanded the land by buying more acres. He made contributions totaling $21.5 million to the Alabama Shakespeare Festival, which remains the single-largest gift ever given to a regional theater in the country.  Blount's philanthropic heart turned Montgomery into a leading cultural center. Had Red and Carolyn not made the financial and creative investment, the theater, museum, and park would not be what it is today. They helped to create a priceless treasure for the area, encouraging the young and old to experience the arts.  There aren't too many people in the world who loved life as much as Red did. He was the kind of person we all want to be, and the State of Alabama is a better place for having Red Blount as part of our history. We are all grateful to Red and his family for giving so much of themselves, and allowing Red to leave us with a wonderful legacy we will never forget.                          ____________________
