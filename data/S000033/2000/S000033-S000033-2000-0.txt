 Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time, and I thank her for bringing forth this very, very important resolution.  It is no secret that in this country we are facing a major energy crisis. It is no secret that the price of home heating oil, propane, kerosene, natural gas has been increasing very, very substantially. It is also no secret that we are the richest country in the history of the world, and that it would be an absolute outrage if any senior citizen, if any low-income American went cold this winter or had to take funds from their food budget in order to pay the heating bill. This is America, and elderly people should not go cold or should not go hungry.  Last month, I authored two letters signed by over 100 Members of Congress, including 20 Republicans, and the first letter urged the President to immediately release $400 million in emergency LIHEAP funding to deal with the energy crisis we are currently facing, and I am grateful that thePresident did that. The second letter urged Congress to increase funding for LIHEAP by 50 percent, from $1.1 billion to $1.65 billion for both fiscal year 2001 and fiscal year 2002, and that is what we are discussing here right now.  The issue is one of priorities. There are people in the Congress who have voted for huge tax breaks for the richest 2 percent of the population. If people are prepared to vote for tax breaks for millionaires, we should be absolutely certain that no one in America goes cold this winter. Let us substantially increase funding for LIHEAP and ease the minds of elderly and lower-income Americans that this winter will not be a brutal one.
