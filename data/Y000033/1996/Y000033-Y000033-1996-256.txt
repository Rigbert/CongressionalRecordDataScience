Mr. Speaker, I want to bring forth to the body here that we want to protect the environment, and we also want to protect private property, the basis of our Constitution.  The gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Pallone] had a zero, a zero rating for private property. He does not believe in private property. The gentleman from California [Mr. Miller] did a little better. He had 7 percent. He slipped up; I do not know what happened. I think the gentleman from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed], he has not spoken as yet, he also got a zero.  What we are saying is private property and the environment, together we can prevail. We ignore private property, we destroy the Constitution.
