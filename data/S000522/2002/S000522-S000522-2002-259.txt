Mr. Speaker, this week marks the 60th anniversary of the infamous Bataan Death March, in which thousands of American and Filipino soldiers lost their lives in one of the most brutal episodes of World War II.  On December 22, 1941, the Japanese Army landed in northern Luzon in the Philippines and began to push southward toward Manila. At first, General Douglas MacArthur was inclined to confront the Japanese on the beaches, but without air support the U.S. Navy's small Asiatic fleet was in no position to challenge Japan at sea. While the U.S. regulars and Philippine Scouts were excellent troops, they were severely outnumbered and would have had no air support.  Giving up his initial strategy of defeating the enemy on the beaches, General MacArthur instead decided to withdraw to the Bataan Peninsula and pursue a strategy of defense and delay, by shortening his lines and using the mountainous, jungle-covered terrain to his advantage. He hoped they could hold out long enough for a relief force to be mounted from the United States.  By March 1942, however, it was clear that help from the United States would not arrive in time. Lacking sufficient food and ammunition, and wracked by dysentery and malaria, nevertheless the American-Filipino force bravely continued to fight.  In March, President Roosevelt ordered General MacArthur to leave the Philippines and escape to Australia, handing over his command to Lt. Gen. Jonathan Wainwright and to Maj. Gen. Edward King.  On April 9, 1942, with food, supplies and ammunition virtually gone, after four months of gallant resistance, the exhausted and starving U.S. troops in Bataan were forced to surrender.  Mr. Speaker, unfortunately the courageous defense of Bataan had a shockingly tragic end. Marching their prisoners toward camps in northern Luzon, the Japanese denied food and water to the sick and starving American and Filipino soldiers for more than a week. When the weakest prisoners began to straggle, Japanese guards shot or bayoneted them and threw their bodies to the side of the road. Even those soldiers who were healthy when the March started became ill with dysentery and malaria along this long road.  It is estimated by some historians that Japanese guards may have killed more than 600 Americans and 10,000 Filipino prisoners during this long and brutal March, and that more than 1,500 American and 25,000 Filipino soldiers may have lost their lives after reaching their destination.  Meanwhile, General Wainwright and his troops on the small, fortified island of Corregidor in Manila Bay had been able to continue resisting for another month, despite being under constant Japanese artillery and air bombardment. But on May 6, 1942, after Japanese troops stormed ashore on the island, General Wainwright agreed to surrender Corregidor and all other U.S. troops on the Philippine islands. And by May 9, 1942, the battle for the Philippines had ended, though there remained some Americans and Filipinos who escaped to the mountains and continued to wage a guerrilla war against the Japanese.  Mr. Speaker, this week, on the 60th Anniversary of the Bataan Death March, there remain thousands of surviving American and Filipino veterans who continue to bear the scars, both physical and emotional, of that war crime. All of the courageous soldiers who fought, persevered or perished on the Island of Philippines at Bataan and Corregidor played a distinctive and vital role in World War II. Their stories, and the full history of the Bataan Death March must never be forgotten.  Inscribed on a monument in Corregidor, there is a poem by an unknown poet that pays homage to these brave soldiers: ``Sleep my sons, your duty done. For Freedom's light has come. Sleep in the Silent Depths of the sea or in your bed of hallowed sod. Until you hear at dawn the low clear reveille of God.''  Mr. Speaker, I call on all Americans who cherish liberty and freedom to join us this week in respectful recognition of the brave United States and Filipino soldiers who served in the Philippines during this fateful event.                          ____________________
