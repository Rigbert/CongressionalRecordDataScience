And as others have mentioned, on April 16, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it was filing a civil lawsuit at long last against the big speculator Goldman Sachs, accusing it of committing fraud, but it was a civil filing.  We know that what happened on Wall Street in the financial markets, the commodities markets, and in the housing markets led to enormous financial turmoil in our country and, ultimately, this great economic crisis that we are facing. And the American people want answers. They want to know who did what, and they ultimately want justice.  A few days after that filing, over five dozen of our colleagues signed on to a bipartisan letter sent to the Attorney General on April 23, and our letter called upon the Attorney General to begin a criminal investigation and prosecution.  One of our concerns continues to be that if, in fact, a civil case is filed by the SEC, could it be possible down the road that some of that evidence could be inadmissible in the event there is a criminal proceeding. So we urged Attorney General Holder to proceed quickly, and today we delivered--in addition to that letter--signatures from over 140,000 Americans who have been signing up on an e-petition to the Attorney General urging the same.  We thank the organizations Progressive Change Campaign Committee and MoveOn.org for alerting citizens across this country that they don't have to be neutral in this fight. They can let their views be known to the Attorney General of our country about the importance of criminal proceedings.  What makes that so important is the fact that the Attorney General's office in the Department of Justice has been understaffed throughout the last 10 years, unable to do the type of financial crimes investigations that are necessary. Back in the savings and loan crisis at the end of the 1990s and early 2000s--or I should say at the end of 1989 up until the early 1990s--we had over 1,000 investigators in financial fraud at this Department of Justice. After 9/11, that was reduced to about 75; and, therefore, we were totally unequipped at the Justice Department to deal with a lot of the wrongdoing that was proceeding through those years and those decades.                              {time}  1800  I have a bill, H.R. 3995, to close that gap and increase the number of investigators. Quite frankly, I have a deep concern about some of the self-serving individuals that may have been representing private interests rather than the public interest as they were conducting their business through Goldman Sachs and other firms.  I would like to place on the record, for example, the following: Joshua Bolten, who was President Bush's chief of staff in the White House at the time that the markets melted down, had actually been the person who ran Goldman Sachs' London office, and yet then he came to be President Bush's chief budget officer and then went to be chief of staff at the White House at the key moment when decisions had to be made about how to handle the financial markets  In the current administration, it is no secret that the chief of staff to the current Secretary of the Treasury, Mark Patterson, had come directly from Goldman Sachs as its top lobbyist. In addition, Neel Kashkari from Goldman Sachs had gone to handle the TARP. I think this goes far beyond party, this has to do with America and standing up as patriots for this country and asking the question: Isn't that too much insider dealing? How do you know that they are really representing their client's interest or the public interest when they are personally involved both on the private side and then on the public side like a very fast revolving door?  I will also place on the Record tonight the fact that since the crisis started the six institutions in addition to Goldman Sachs, that includes Citibank and Wells Fargo, HSBC, Morgan Stanley, all these big banks now control two-thirds of the deposits and GDP of this country. Six institutions. They are raiding equity out of our local communities. They are just simply too powerful and they are too irresponsible. They are not doing loan workouts in places I come from. I thank the gentlelady for calling into question their business principles as you so ably put on the floor here as to who their interests really are.  That is my bottom line question: Who do these people represent? They seem to be getting bonuses at extraordinary levels, in the millions of dollars. When people in my district have fallen off unemployment benefits, these companies like JPMorgan Chase do not return phone calls to do loan workouts. Wells Fargo, they are totally irresponsible. They have too much power andthey are thumbing their nose at the American people at a time when our people are just hanging on.  I want to thank the gentlelady for holding this Special Order this evening and for giving us a chance to place on the Record the letter that we sent to the attorney general asking for criminal proceedings, and also the names of the Members of Congress who have signed on this letter. I urge other colleagues who wish to join us to please give us a call. I thank you for allowing me to place this information into the Record.                                Congress of the United States,                                   Washington, DC, April 23, 2010.     Hon. Eric Holder     U.S. Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice,          Washington, DC.       Dear Attorney General Holder: The U.S. Securities and      Exchange Commission (SEC) announced on Friday, April 16,      2010, that it had filed a securities fraud action against the      Wall Street company Goldman Sachs & Co (GS& Co.) and one of      its employees for making materially misleading statements and      omissions in connection with a synthetic collateralized debt      obligation (``CDO'') that GS & Co. structured and marketed to      investors. The SEC alleges that:       1. This synthetic CDO, ABACUS 2007-AC1, was tied to the      performance of sub-prime residential mortgage-backed      securities (``RMBS'') and was structured and marketed by GS &      Co. in early 2007 when the United States housing market and      related securities were beginning to show signs of distress.      Synthetic CDOs like ABACUS 2007-AC1 contributed to the recent      financial crisis by magnifying losses associated with the      downturn in the United States housing market.       2. GS & Co. marketing materials for ABACUS 2007-AC1--     including the term sheet, flip book and offering memorandum      for the CDO--all represented that the reference portfolio of      RMBS underlying the CDO was selected by ACA Management with      experience analyzing credit risk in RMBS. Undisclosed in the      marketing materials and unbeknownst to investors, a large      hedge fund, Paulson & Co. Inc. (``Paulson''), with economic      interests directly adverse to investors in the ABACUS 2007-     AC1 CDO, played a significant role in the portfolio selection      process. After participating in the selection of the      reference portfolio, Paulson effectively shorted the RMBS      portfolio it helped select by entering into credit default      swaps (``CDS'') with GS & Co. to buy protection on specific      layers of the ABACUS 2007-AC1 capital structure.       3. In sum, GS & Co. arranged a transaction at Paulson's      request in which Paulson heavily influenced the selection of      the portfolio to suit its economic interests, but failed to      disclose to investors, as part of the description of the      portfolio selection process contained in the marketing      materials used to promote the transaction, Paulson's role in      the portfolio selection process or its adverse economic      interests.       As the SEC notes, financial manipulations such as this      contributed to the near collapse of the U.S. financial system      and cost American taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars.      On the face of the SEC filing, criminal fraud on a historic      scale seems to have occurred in this instance. As an ever      growing mountain of evidence reveals, this case is neither      unique nor isolated.       If both global and domestic confidence in the integrity of      the U.S. financial system is to be regained, there must be      confidence that criminal acts will be vigorously pursued and      perpetrators punished.       While the SEC lacks the authority to act beyond civil      actions, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has the power      to file criminal actions against those who commit financial      fraud. We ask assurance from you that the U.S. Department of      Justice is closely looking at this case and similar cases to      further investigate and prosecute the criminals involved in      this, and other financially fraudulent acts. Furthermore, if      the DOJ is not currently looking into this particular case,      we respectfully ask you to ensure that the U.S. Department of      Justice immediately open a case on this matter and      investigate it with the full authority and power that your      agency holds. The American people both demand and deserve      justice in the matter of Wall Street banks whom the American      taxpayers bailed out, only to see unemployment and housing      foreclosures rise.       This matter is of deep importance to us. As you may know,      H.R. 3995, the Financial Crisis of 2008 Criminal      Investigation and Prosecution Act, has been introduced, which      authorizes you to hire more prosecutors, Director Mueller of      the Federal Bureau of Investigation to hire 1,000 more agent      as well as additional forensic experts, and Chair Mary      Schapiro of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to      hire more investigators to continue to pursue justice and      route out the criminals in our financial system. Part of      financial regulatory reform should include removing the      criminals and crafting a system that supports those who      follow the law.       We in Congress stand ready to support you in protecting the      American taxpayers from financial crimes such as the fraud      that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has charged      Goldman Sachs with committing. We ask that you take up this      case, and others, to pursue justice for the American people,      to put criminals in jail, and seek to restore the integrity      of our nation's financial system.
