Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join my colleagues in bringing to the floor today a resolution that addresses a common but often unrecognized problem, suicide. This resolution recognizes suicide as a national problem and declares suicide prevention to be a national priority.  While no single prevention program would be appropriate for all populations and communities, the point of this resolution is to create a climate for suicide prevention, to recognize as a Nation that we must become aware of the problem, that we are to address it and eventually solve it.                              {time}  1615  We must not remain quiet or silent on problems that cause us pain. Instead, we must bring the problems out from under the rug into the light where we can deal with them. If we begin to do that as a Nation, it is my hope that we will encourage individuals and communities nationwide to do the same.  I am pleased that more than 92 of my colleagues are joining me in this effort by becoming original cosponsors of this resolution. I want to thank my good friend from North Carolina (Mr. Burr) for managing the bill on the other side.  Suicide touches hundreds of American families every year. An estimated 750,000 people attempt suicide each year. Suicide claims the lives of more than 31,000 people annually, more than homicide. Suicide is the ninth leading cause of all deaths in the United States, and the third for young people age 15 to 24. It is on the rise for young people in general and for African-American young men in particular.  Only by talking about mental illness and encouraging treatment can we begin to address the painful issue that leads to suicide. We must tell our friends and our loved ones that it is okay to talk about feelings of despair, depression and hopelessness and suicide. For those who have the courage to get help, to seek treatment, we must support them, and we must talk about suicide so that we can try to understand it and prevent it.  Too much shame surrounds feelings of depression and suicide. We can change that and we must, by reaching out to others in our communities. The Senate has already passed a similar resolution on suicide recognition and prevention. I urge all of my colleagues in the House to join me and many others, Republicans and Democrats, from all parts of the Nation in our pledge to work together towards suicide prevention, awareness and treatment. Please join us in supporting House Resolution 212, a resolution recognizing suicide as a national problem.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee).
