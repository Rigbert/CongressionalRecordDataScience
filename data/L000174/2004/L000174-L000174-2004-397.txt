President, again reserving the right to object, there will be a request for a rollcall vote, and I assume the leader would join in that, that there would be a request for a rollcall vote on the two judges, 10-minute rollcall votes so we are only here for 11 minutes, and everybody will be out on the second one. I only ask to protect my rights to ask for those rollcall votes.
