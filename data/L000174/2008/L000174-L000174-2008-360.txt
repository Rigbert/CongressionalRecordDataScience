President, we all want to be able to collect intelligence on terrorists. When I came here, during the Cold War, we wanted to be sure we could collect on our adversaries. We still want to be sure we can do that. That is why I have voted for dozens of changes to FISA over the years, requested by both Republican and Democratic administrations. I voted for them because the administrations made a clear and convincing case each time that we needed a change to keep up with the technology or to keep up with a changing threat.  But let's not be so frightened by terrorists that we go back to the situation we had during the Watergate era, when we found our Government was spying on people who disagreed with it. The government spied on people who had legitimate concerns about, for example, the war in Vietnam or the excesses of J. Edgar Hoover. The government could do that back then because there were no checks and there was no oversight. We do not want to go back to that time. We can do our intelligence gathering and protect Americans at the same time.  Now, Mr. President, has my time expired?
