``Bill'' Boyle, a lifelong Toledoan, a veteran, police officer, business owner, civic leader, and a leading force in Lucas County politics for the better part of four decades.  On behalf of our entire community, please let me extend deepest sympathy, comfort, and gratitude to Bill's beloved family and friends. Always a family man and proud of his Irish-American heritage, he was a compassionate but stern taskmaster, relishing his role as father, grandfather, great grandfather, brother, uncle, and loyal friend.  Bill was born on June 5, 1930 to Theresa and Daniel Boyle, who immigrated to America from Ireland. He attended St. Ann Grade School and was a proud 1948 graduate of Central Catholic. He attended Georgetown University, and then later attended the University of Toledo, receiving his bachelor's degree in 1990.  He was gifted. He was patriotic. He was a strong, fearless, and unrelenting leader on many levels. He was a dogged fighter for his beliefs. His toughness could mask a sense of humor that he royally shared. Rising from the working class of people, he began his career in service to America as an Air Force Intelligence Officer, returned home to enlist in the Toledo Police Division where he was seriously wounded in a gun battle, losing his right eye, and then faced recasting his life.  He pursued wide ranging interests, choosing to lead a community-focused life with innumerable generous works. He chose to take the helm as Chair of the then beleaguered Lucas County Democratic Party. He built it into the most successful county party in the state of Ohio at the time, drawing forth new leadership down to the precinct level. He recruited a new generation of idealistic candidates to serve the region. Bill served as Executive Director of the Democratic Party from 1967 to 1970 and was Chairman of the Democratic Party from 1970 to 1984.  Bill then built again--by acquiring the TolTest Company and transforming it into a highly successful Toledo company, anchoring its headquarters in then job-short Downtown Toledo, just blocks away from where he had been wounded in the line of duty.  Our community has benefitted intergenerationally from Bill's wisdom and community-minded life. His business acumen and philanthropy in education and other fields kept building Toledo forward even during the toughest economic times.  Bill will be remembered for his dedication to his family, and we offer his children Mike, Kathy, Beth, Pat, and Kris, his 14 grandchildren and 7 great-grandchildren, his brother Regis and sisters Sheila, Theresa and Ann, and his friends our prayers and hope that they find comfort in the wonderful memories of what Bill had meant to so many who treasured his life and valued his pursuits.  May his loved ones gain strength to endure from the example he set--to triumph again and again over adversity. His relentless spirit and good works now form part of the precious character of our community.  I thank Bill Boyle for sharing his extraordinary life with us.                          ____________________
