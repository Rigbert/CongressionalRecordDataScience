President, as we celebrate National Women's History Month during this time of war, I rise to pay tribute to the extraordinary women, past and present, who have served this country selflessly and courageously in the armed services.  Over 20 years ago, my distinguished colleagues, Senator Barbara Mikulski and Senator Orrin Hatch, cosponsored legislation that first established the National Women's History Week. I salute my colleagues for their leadership in establishing this now month-long celebration of women and their many contributions.  This year's theme for National Women's History Month is ``Women Pioneering the Future.'' As we anxiously await a safe and swift end to the war in Iraq, it seems appropriate to honor and remember the pioneering women of the armed services. Today it is common, and perhaps unremarkable, to see women serving in a variety of capacities in the Persian Gulf. As a result, itis easy to forget that at one time the women who served this country in every major military conflict were unwanted and ill-treated.  During the Revolutionary War, women were prohibited from enlisting in the Continental Army, but that did not stop many women from following their husbands to war where they served as cooks and nurses. One brave woman, Margaret Corbin, took over her fallen husband's cannon at the Battle of Fort Washington. During the battle she was wounded and taken prisoner by the British. On July 6, 1779, Mrs. Corbin became the first woman to be awarded a Federal pension for being wounded in battle.  During the American Civil War, hundreds of women disguised themselves as men in order to serve in the Union and Confederate Armies. Many women were never discovered and most were not discovered until they were wounded or found dead on the battlefield. One woman enlisted in the 95th Illinois Infantry as Albert Cashier. Under the guise of a 19-year-old Irish immigrant, she served for 4 years, participating in almost 40 battles.  Following the Spanish American War, where more than 1,500 women were contracted to serve as nurses, the Army Nurse Corps of 1901 and the Navy Nurse Corp of 1908 were created, making women official members of the military for the first time. Twenty contract nurses died in service during the Spanish-American War and over 400 nurses died in the line of duty during World War I.  In addition to serving as nurses, during World War I, women were enlisted in the Navy and the Marine Corps to serve as stenographers and typists. In addition to these 12,185 female Yeomen, 230 women were hired by the Army to serve in France as bilingual telephone operators. These ``Hello Girls'' routed messages between headquarters and the front lines. Despite the great service of the women of World War I, Congress soon took action to close the loopholes that had allowed women to serve in the military.  Decades later, in order to meet the huge demands of World War II, all four services of the military formed women's components which were to last ``for the duration of the emergency and six months.'' Four hundred thirty two military women were killed in that war and 88 became prisoners of war. Sixty-six Army nurses endured an incredible 33 months at the Santo Tomas prison camp in the Philippines.  Finally, in 1948, women achieved permanent status in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, when President Truman signed the Women's Armed Services Integration Act of 1948. Unfortunately, that act restricted the number of women who could enlist and the award of promotions. Despite these restrictions, many thousands of women have served in a variety of capacities during the major military conflicts in Korea, Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf.  In fact, according to the Department of the Navy, the deployment of women in the Persian Gulf was ``highly successful.'' More than 37,000 women served as administrators, air traffic controllers, logisticians, engineer equipment mechanics, ammunition technicians, ordinance specialists, communicators, radio operators, drivers, law enforcement specialists, and guards during Desert Shield/Desert Storm. Tragically, during that conflict, 5 women were killed in action, 21 were wounded in action, 2 were taken as prisoners of war, and 4 Marine women received the Combat Action Ribbon.  Today, women make up about 15 percent of the military and nearly 85 percent of all positions and occupations in the military are available to active-duty women. The progress that has been made in opening military service to the women of the United States is no doubt a reflection of the incredible service records of the pioneering women soldiers who have served this country since the Revolutionary War.  One such pioneering woman is National Women's History Month Honoree, BG Wilma L. Vaught. General Vaught grew up in rural Scotland, IL, and attended the University of Illinois. After college and some time spent in the corporate world, she joined the Air Force, in part, because of the opportunity it offered for managerial advancement.  While serving in the Air Force, General Vaught achieved several ``firsts'': first female Air Force officer to attend the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, first woman to command a unit that received the Joint Meritorious Unit Award, first woman promoted to Brigadier General in the comptroller career field, and the first and only woman to serve as president of the board of directors of the Pentagon Federal Credit Union. In addition, General Vaught is one of the most highly decorated women in history. It was my honor to meet General Vaught several years ago and feature her on my monthly cable television show.  This March, as the Nation prays for the safe return of our soldiers in Iraq, let us remember the incredible contributions that women like BG Wilma Vaught have made in service of our country.                          ____________________
