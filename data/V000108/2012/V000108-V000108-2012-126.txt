Dingell, I appreciate your yielding. I want to thank both you and my good friend from Ohio for reserving this time, and the Chair's indulgence.  Mr. Speaker, it is with fond admiration and profound respect that I take this time to recognize a very dear friend and one of Indiana's most distinguished citizens, the Honorable John Vincent Sullivan, whom I will always claim as a resident of the First Congressional District, having graduated from Munster High School in Munster, Indiana.  It has been mentioned that he has served this country in the United States Air Force for 20 years--9 years active service, 11 years in the Reserve, and retiring with the designation of lieutenant colonel.  What has not been mentioned, I don't think, this evening is that for some inexplicable reason John also wanted to jump out of airplanes, and became a qualified paratrooper. Ultimately, he found himself at Indiana University Law School, as has been mentioned by Mrs. Biggert, but which was qualified by the gentlewoman from Maryland, who indicated that in fact I don't think that John is so much an IU fan as he is a rabid Bobby Knight fan.  But I do think that the mark of the man is the recognition of his legal acumen, his grace under pressure, and his scrupulous fairness when a Democratic Speaker, Tip O'Neill, requested that he join the Parliamentarian's office in 1987. And that 17 years later, his leadership skills and his ability to make nimble and wise decisions in very stressful and momentous situations was recognized by Republican Speaker Dennis Hastert, who asked that he become Parliamentarian of the House.  Mr. Speaker, John comes from a strong family of nine children, and his siblings love him deeply and know him better than any of us. I am happy to share some of their thoughts with my colleagues.  Margaret mentions:       As a teacher, I know about the incredible power of a good      model. John has provided the best model of a good brother,      husband, public servant, son, and man throughout my life, and      I adore him.  His sister Anne said:       As a little sister, I chose John as my role model for      integrity. Later, I chose him as my role model for word      choice, too.  Patty remarks that:       My heart is so full, I do not know where to start. You know      how I feel about my magnificent big brother.  Gary, for himself and for Mary Fran, John's sister whom he has lost, said:       I speak for Mary Fran and myself in sending love and thanks      to John for his service to our country.  His brother Matt said:       I would like to add my voice to my siblings' in expressing      my love and appreciation of our brother John.  Michael noted:       John and I played together, ate together, fought together,      got in trouble together, slept together, walked to school      together, and talked to each other about everything. That is      really where I learned all the important things about life.      That is where I learned what it took to be a good man. John      was my big brother, but he has always been my confidant and      mentor. He is my number one phone call when I need advice. He      has the discipline and fairness that I lack. So it is good to      have him to lean on. I love you, John, and I look forward to      enjoying a piece of your retirement with you.  Jerry observed that:       John went to take his physical qualification test for the      Air Force Academy and came back and told Dad he didn't      seem to do as well as he had expected. He did plenty well      enough, passed, and graduated the Academy. Turned out      there was a reason for his feeling a bit less than full      strength during the test. He had a case of mononucleosis      that had not yet been diagnosed. He plowed through the      tough test in typical fashion for John. Only he, as his      own toughest critic, got any sense that something was not      quite right. The rest of the world did nothing but approve      of his skill, dedication, and durability, which have      always added up to make him the best sort of guy.  His brother Jim noted--and I would like to state for the record that John looks a lot older than Jim:       I am 4 years older than John but have looked up to him      since I can remember. He is simply the finest man I know. He      is as tough as they come, and he is as gentle as a lamb with      the innocent and those less strong than he. He is fearless,      and I have seen him risk much to speak for the right,      regardless of the risk to himself. I have seen him operate,      in the right, with all the advantages, and yet let the      vanquished foe up and off the hook, time and again. He      embodies the idea of following the harder right rather than      the easier wrong, and of being humble and gentle in victory,      stern and unyielding in defeat. His goodness and strength are      clear from the moment you meet him.  Mr. Speaker, I would add that I will miss the opportunity that John provided every time I had young people in the gallery since 1987 for the opportunity to point him out with pride as being from ``back home,'' and emphasizing that he was someone they could emulate; that by studying hard, by using the talents God had given them, they, too, could achieve a position of great responsibility and great opportunity to be of service to others and to their country.  We will all miss you, John--a man who has dedicated and devoted his life to serving his country. This institution and each of us have become more effective and judicious stewards of the public trust because of John Sullivan's example, his wisdom, and yes, his good humor.  So I would conclude by saying, Mr. Speaker, that despite all of the disparaging remarks John has made over these many years about the quality of the football team in South Bend, Indiana, called Notre Dame, I do sincerely wish him, his wife Nancy, and their family every blessing and happiness life has to offer.                              {time}  1950  Mr. LaTOURETTE. I thank the gentleman from Indiana.
