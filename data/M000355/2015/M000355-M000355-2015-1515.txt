 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m. on Tuesday, April 14; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, and the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day; that following leader remarks, the Senate be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each. I further ask that theSenate recess from 10:30 a.m. until 11:30 a.m. for the all-Senators briefing and that it recess again from 12:30 p.m. to 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly conference meetings.
