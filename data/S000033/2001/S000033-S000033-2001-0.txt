 I was watching C-Span and I heard all these fine words about David Bonior. I thought, ``My God, something has happened. He's dead. What a shame.''  I came down here, he looks very good and the only thing that is happening to him is, he is going to be governor of the great State of Michigan and certainly while it is our loss, it is Michigan's gain.  In this institution, given all of the political and economic and financial pressures that are on all the Members, it is very difficult to hold out a moral compass, to be very sure that the values that you are fighting for are what you believe. It is doubly difficult to do that year after year. The first year you could do it and the second year, but after many years, it becomes harder and harder to do.  I think on virtually every issue affecting the lives of working people, whether it is helping people join unions and fight for their dignity there, whether it is developing a sane trade policy which protects the needs of American workers or raising the minimum wage or affordable housing or all the things that millions and millions of working families need, year after year, right up here, at this podium, Dave Bonior has been leading the fight. We are very proud of him, not just becausehe is a good politician; because of the strong sense of morality and values that motivate him.  David, you have been an inspiration to all of us. My wife says that you are her second favorite Congressman. I am not sure who the first one is, to tell you the truth, but we are going to miss you very much and the people of Michigan are very lucky to have you.
