Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing legislation that would designate the Atlanta Federal Center as the Sam Nunn Federal Center, in honor of the former Senator from Georgia.  I believe we all recognize the tremendous accomplishments of Sam Nunn during his service in the U.S. Senate. Senator Nunn is one of the true statesmen of that body and is a source of pride to Georgia. Since my election to Congress in 1986, I have had many opportunities to work with Senator Nunn on several issues and often benefited from his experience and support during the time that we served together.  Since his election to the Senate in 1972, Senator Nunn has served the State of Georgia with honor and dedication. Senator Nunn worked to become the Senate's foremost expert on national security and international affairs. Senator Nunn served 8 years as the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and retired as the ranking Democrat on both the Armed Service Committee and the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.  I have dedicated much time and effort in support of the Atlanta Federal Center. When Georgia Gov. Zell Miller approached me and asked my support for naming the Federal Center after Senator Nunn, I thought the dedication a fitting tribute to Senator Nunn. For these reasons, I will work to see that the Federal Center soon bears the name of our former Senator, Senator Sam Nunn.                          ____________________
