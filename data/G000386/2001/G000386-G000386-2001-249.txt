 We cannot expect 100 Members of the Senate to vote yes or no on an amendment unless we know what that amendment is.  The pattern I set in the Senate Finance Committee is best illustrated by something I told each of the other 19 members when I went to their offices to visit with them about how they saw the committee ought to function and how we ought to do business. That is, No. 1, transparency; and, No. 2, communication. The bottom line was I told every member if they wanted to know what was going on in this committee, all they had to do was ask and they would get an answer. If they didn't get an answer, at least they were entitled to know why they couldn't get an answer. And 99.9 percent of the time I figure everybody is entitled to know what everybody else is doing.  Now we reach a point where the product of this bipartisan effort is in this Chamber, and I hope in the very same way we can communicate with each other, we can be very transparent. But most important, on the issue of what amendments we are going to vote on, we ought to have those amendments at the desk so we can study them while we are debating other amendments.
