 Res. 455       Whereas, Senator Charles Schumer has been named as a      defendant in the case of Richard Arjun Kaul v. Senator      Charles Schumer, et al., Case No. 19-CV-13477-BRM-JAD,      currently pending in the United States District Court for the      District of New Jersey;       Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(1) of the      Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 288b(a)      and 288c(a)(1), the Senate may direct its counsel to defend      Members of the Senate in civil actions relating to their      official responsibilities: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to      represent Senator Schumer in the case of Richard Arjun Kaul      v. Senator Charles Schumer, et al.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send to the desk a resolution authorizing representation by the Senate Legal Counsel and ask for its immediate consideration.  Mr. President, this resolution concerns a civil action pending in New Jersey Federal court against Senator Schumer and various private entities. The plaintiff previously brought a lawsuit arising out of the revocation of his medical license by the New Jersey State Board of Medical Examiners, and that lawsuit was dismissed. In this lawsuit, plaintiff asserts a conspiracy among Senator Schumer and two large insurance companies, a bank, a law firm, and a media company, to obstruct and undermine plaintiff's previous lawsuit by having the Senator use his influence over the presiding judge to dismiss the case. Plaintiff's claims against Senator Schumer are subject to dismissal for failure to State a claim and on jurisdictional grounds. This resolution would authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to represent Senator Schumer in order to seek dismissal of the claims against him.                          ____________________
