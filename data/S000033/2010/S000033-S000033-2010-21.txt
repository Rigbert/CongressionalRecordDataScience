 I know she shares with me the belief that the American people have to become engaged in this very important debate, which has a lot to do with the future of this country.  Senator Landrieu asks a very simple question, which I would like--and I think the American people would like--an answer to: Whose brilliant idea was it--at a time when we have seen an explosion in income and wealth to the people on top, while their tax rates have already gone down--that we drive up the national debt and ask our kids to pay higher taxes to pay off that debt in order to give tax breaks to people who don't need them? That is the question Senator Landrieu is asking. I think the American people need an answer to that, and my hope is that millions of Americans will start calling their Senators to ask that question.
