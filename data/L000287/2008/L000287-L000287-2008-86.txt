Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, on Tax Day, it is so important that we bring H.R. 5719 to the floor of the House. Taxpayers must be treated fairly, and they deserve all the help we can give them.  This bill draws, in part, on legislation authored by myself and many members of the Ways and Means Committee. Most of the pieces of this bill enjoy bipartisan support.  This bill will assist victims of identity theft and prevent the misuse of the IRS name in schemes that defraud the public.  The bill helps low-income taxpayers by allowing IRS employees to refer them to low-income taxpayer clinics, expanding earned income tax credit outreach, and authorizing funding for low-income taxpayer programs.  It would, once and for all, repeal the authority of the IRS to enter into private debt collection contracts. This program violates the public trust and must end.  The bill also protects elderly and disabled persons from tax liability on workers provided to them under government programs.  H.R. 5719 enhances the fairness of our tax code and deserves this House's total support.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
