 Our bill funds water resource projects that are critical, including in Texas; supports science and energy technology research activities necessary to build the future and our future competitiveness; and responsibly funds a credible nuclear deterrent and important nonproliferation efforts.  This amendment will harm all of these. It will harm job creation and reduce protections against flooding and natural disasters that all parts of our country have been facing.  One can be penny-wise and pound-foolish, and not making these investments will make the costs in the future even greater.  This amendment will also result in fewer investments in water resource infrastructure and energy research and development programs, all of whichcreate good jobs, have substantial returns on investment, and position our Nation for future needs.  We must continue investing in these areas to ensure our national security on many levels and to remain the global leader in energy and in science.  Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.
