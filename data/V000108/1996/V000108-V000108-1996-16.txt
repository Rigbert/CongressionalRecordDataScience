Speaker, it is my honor to commend the Save the Dunes Council, and its executive director, Tom Anderson, as they celebrate their 44th anniversary. The Save the Dunes Council is primarily responsible for the creation of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, which celebrates its 30th anniversary this year.  The Save the Dunes Council was formed to establish a dunes national park. Its main goal was to fight off plans of powerful political and economic interests to industrialize the entire Hoosier shoreline on Lake Michigan. In 1952, Dorothy Buell, a citizen of Ogden Dunes, invited two dozen area women to a meeting in her house on the first day of the summer. This fledgling group was called the Save the Dunes Council. Their main focus was to raise money to buy the 5 miles of beach and dunes generally located between the towns of Dune Acres on the east and Ogden Dunes on the west. These women did succeed in purchasing a piece of the unprotected land at a 1953 Port County tax sale, which now stands as Cowles Bog.  From these early beginnings, the council, which included Herb and Charlotte Read, and Illinois Senator Paul Douglas, traveled to Washington, DC, to fight plans to industrialize the area. As a result, on November 5, 1966, the first Indiana Dunes bill was enacted to create the 5,800-acre Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Since 1983, Dale B. Enquist has been superintendent of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. This year, Mr. Enquist received the Department of the Interior's highest honor, the Meritorious Service Award.  The Council fought corporate interests and the entire Indiana legislative and congressional delegations in the days before the National Environmental Policy Act and open meetings law. While two steel plants and a deep water port on Lake Michigan now sit in the heart of the dunes, 14,000 acres of Indiana's dunes are forever protected as a State and national parkland.  The Save the Dunes Council developed tactics and strategies that were never used before. It stood up to corporate America and won the battle. The Save the Dunes Council has preserved one of the country's most beautiful and precious assets to ever exist. Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending the Save the Dunes Council, as well as the hope it embodies in its continuing effort to preserve our environment.                          ____________________
