President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senators Harkin, Kennedy, Coleman, Pryor, Cantwell, Durbin, Mikulski, Bingaman, Lautenberg and Kerry, in introducing the ``Keeping Families Together Act.'' This legislation is intended to reduce the barriers to care for children with serious mental illness so that their parents are no longer forced to give up custody solely for the purpose of securing mental health treatment.  Serious mental illness afflicts millions of our Nation's children and adolescents. It is estimated that as many as 20 percent of American children under the age of 17 suffer from a mental, emotional or behavioral illness. What I find most disturbing, however, is the fact that two-thirds of all young people who need mental health treatment are not getting it.  Behind each of these statistics is a family that is struggling to do the best it can to help a son or daughter with serious mental health needs to be just like every other kid--to develop friendships, to do well in school, and to get along with their siblings and other family members. These children are almost always involved with more than one social service agency, including the mental health, special education, child welfare, and juvenile justice systems. Yet no one agency, at either the State or the Federal level, is clearly responsible or accountable for helping these children and their families.  My interest in this issue was triggered by a compelling series of stories by Barbara Walsh in the Portland Press Herald which detailed the obstacles that many Maine families have faced in getting desperately needed mental health services for their children. Too many families in Maine and elsewhere have been forced to make wrenching decisions when they have been advised that the only way to get the care that their children so desperately need is to relinquish custody and place them in either the child welfare or juvenile justice system.  When a child has a serious physical health problem like diabetes or a heart condition, the family turns to their doctor. When the family includes a child with a serious mental illness, it is often forced to go to the child welfare or juvenile justice system to secure treatment.  Yet neither system is intended to serve children with serious mental illness. Child welfare systems are designed to protect children who have been abused or neglected. Juvenile justice systems are designed to rehabilitate children who have committed criminal or delinquent acts. While neither of these systems is equipped to care for a child with a serious mental illness, in far too many cases, there is nowhere else for the family to turn.  In some extreme cases, families feel forced to file charges against their child or to declare that they have abused or neglected them in order to get the care that they need. As one family advocate observed, ``Beat `em up, lock `em up, or give `em up,'' characterizes the choices that some families face in their efforts to get help for their children's mental illness.  In 2003, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report that I requested with Representatives Pete Stark and Patrick Kennedy that found that, in 2001, parents placed more than 12,700 children into the child welfare or juvenile justice systems so that these children could receive mental health services. This likely is just the tip of the iceberg, since 32 States--including five States with the largest populations of children--did not provide the GAO with any data.  Other studies indicate that the problem is even more pervasive. A 1999 survey by the National Alliance on Mental Illness found that 23 percent--or one in four of the parents surveyed--had been told by public officials that they needed to relinquish custody of their children to get care, and that one in five of these families had done so.  Some States have passed laws to limit custody or prohibit custody relinquishment. Simply banning the practice is not a solution, however, since it can leave children with mental illness and their families without services and care. Custody relinquishment is merely a symptom of the much larger problem, which is the lack of available, affordable and appropriate mental health services and support systems for these children and their families.  In 2003 and 2004, I chaired a series of hearings in the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to examine this issue further. We heard compelling testimony from mothers who told us that they were advised that the only way to get the intensive care and services that their children needed was to relinquish custody and place them in the child welfare or juvenile justice system. This is a wrenching decision that no family should be forced to make. No parent should have to give up custody of his or her child just to get the services that the child needs.  The mothers also described the barriers they faced in getting care for their children. They told us about the limitations in both public and private insurance coverage. They also talked about the lack of coordination and communication among the various agencies and programs that service children with mental health needs. One parent, desperate for help for her twin boys, searched for two years until she finally located a program--which she characterized as ``the best kept secret in Illinois''--that was able to help.  Parents should not be bounced from agency to agency, knocking on every door they come to, in the hope that they will happen upon someone who has an answer. It simply should not be such a struggle for parents to get services and treatment for their children.  We also need to question what happens to these children when they are turned over to the child welfare or juvenile justice authorities. I released a report in 2004 with Congressman Henry Waxman that found that all too often they are simply left to languish in juvenile detention centers, which are ill-equipped to meet their needs, while they wait for scarce mental health services.  Our report, which was based on a national survey of juvenile detention centers, found that the use of juvenile detention facilities to ``warehouse'' children with mental disorders is a serious national problem. It found that, over a six month period, nearly 15,000 young people--roughly seven percent of all of the children in the centers surveyed--were detained solely because they were waiting for mental health services outside the juvenile justice system. Many were held without any charges pending against them, and the young people incarcerated unnecessarily while waiting for treatment were as young as seven years old. Finally, the report estimated that juvenile detention facilities are spending an estimated $100 million of the taxpayers' money each year simply to warehouse children and teenagers while they are waiting for mental health services.  The Keeping Families Together Act, which we are introducing today, will help to improve access to mental health services and assist states in eliminating the practice of parents relinquishing custody of their children solely for the purpose of securing treatment.  The legislation authorizes $100 million over six years for competitive grants to states to create an infrastructure to support and sustain statewide systems of care to serve children who are in custody or at risk of entering custody of the State for the purpose of receiving mental health services. States already dedicate significant dollars to serve children in state custody. These Family Support Grants would help states to serve children more effectively and efficiently, while keeping them at home with their families.  In addition, the legislation calls for the creation of a federal interagency task force to examine mental health issues in the child welfare and juvenile justice systems and the role of those agencies in promoting access by children and youth to needed mental health services. The task force would also be charged with monitoring the Family Support grants, making recommendations to Congress on how to improve mental health services, and fostering interagency cooperation and removing interagency barriers that contribute to the problem of custody relinquishment.  The Keeping Families Together Act takes a critical step forward to meeting the needs of children with serious mental or emotional disorders. Our legislation has been endorsed by a broad coalition of mental health and children's groups, including the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, Mental Health America, the American Psychological Association, and the American Psychiatric Association. I ask unanimous consent that letters from these organizations endorsing the bill be printed in the Record.  The Keeping Families Together Act will help to reduce the barriers to care for children with serious mental illness, and I urge our colleagues to join us as cosponsors.  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                               Bazelon Center,                                 Washington, DC, January 17, 2007.     Hon. Susan Collins     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: The Judge David L. Bazelon Center for      Mental Health Law--the leading national legal-advocacy      organization representing children and adults with mental      disabilities who primarily rely on the public mental health      system for treatment--is pleased to support the Keeping      Families Together Act and commends your leadership on this      important legislation.       A lack of access to appropriate mental health services and      supports for children in both the private and public sectors      is a significant barrier families across the country face      when they are confronted with the horrific problem of custody      relinquishment of a child solely to access necessary menta1      health treatment. Custody relinquishment for these purposes      should not and does not need to happen. It is a symptom of a      flawed children's mental health system that is in crisis.       The Keeping Families Together Act serves to address this      fragmented system by assisting states in developing and      expanding capacity to serve children with severe mental and      emotional disorders so families have options when their child      is in need of mental health care. With studies showing      approximately two-thirds of children and adolescents are not      receiving the mental health services they need, we welcome      this vital legislation. Promoting early intervention,      ensuring access to wide range of services and supports and      helping to maintain family integrity are achievable goals      supported by your legislation--goals we are confident will      help reduce these appalling statistics.       The Bazelon Center looks forward to working closely with      you and your staff throughout the legislative process to      enact the Keeping Families Together Act. Thank you for your      commitment to the health and mental health needs of our most      vulnerable chi1dren.           Sincerely,                                          Robert Bernstein, Ph.D.,     Executive Director.                                  ____                           American Psychological Association,                                 Washington, DC, January 19, 2007.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the 145,000 members and      affiliates of the American Psychological Association (APA), I      am writing in support of the Keeping Families Together Act.      This vital legislation would establish a state family support      grant program to end the practice of parents needing to      relinquish legal custody of their children to state agencies      for the sole purpose of obtaining mental health services for      their children.       As you know, the custody relinquishment problem stems from      a paradox that exists in many states. Private healthcare      plans frequently do not cover many services needed by      children with physical, mental, or developmental      disabilities. As a result, many parents turn to the child      welfare or juvenile justice system for assistance. Neither of      these     systems is intended nor equipped to care for a child with a      serious mental health problem. Yet, as the law currently      exists in many states, parents must relinquish custody to      receive otherwise unaffordable specialized care for their      children. Ironically, these children are frequently placed      with foster families that receive full funding for the      children's care, while competent parents lose contact with,      influence over and decision making authority for their      children. Custody relinquishment of a child solely so he or      she may access necessary mental health services is a national      tragedy.       The Keeping Families Together Act lays a strong foundation      for needed reforms by promoting access to needed services and      reducing fragmentation in service delivery. Some of the      legislation's main provisions include providing grants to      states to establish interagency systems of care for children      and adolescents with serious mental health and emotional      problems. Additionally, this legislation will establish a      federal interagency task force to examine mental health      issues in the child welfare and juvenile justice systems.       APA members are actively engaged in research and practice      initiatives related to helping children and their families      receive the mental health services they need. Please view APA      as a resource to you for empirically-based research on child      mental health matters when considering the enactment of the      Keeping Families Together Act.       In closing, we would like to thank you once again for your      efforts in developing the Keeping Families Together Act and      to offer our association's assistance in furthering passage      of this vital legislation. Please contact Annie Toro of our      Public Policy Office if you would like any additional      information.           Sincerely,                                      Gwendolyn Puryear Keita,                                               Executive Director,     Public Interest Directorate.                                  ____                                        Mental Health America,                                Alexandria, VA., January 22, 2007.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Pete Stark,     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.     Hon. Tom Harkin,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Jim Ramstad,     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Collins and Harkin and Representatives      Ramstad and Stark: On behalf of Mental Health America      (formerly the National Mental Health Association), I am      writing to commend you for reintroducing the Keeping Families      Together Act in the 110th Congress.       As you know, thousands of families every year are forced to      give up custody of their children to the state in order to      secure vitally necessary mental health services. This custody      relinquishment tears families apart, is devastating for      parents and caregivers, and leaves children feeling abandoned      in their hour of greatest need. Parents are often forced to      take this tragic step because their private health care      coverage imposes discriminatory and restrictive caps on      mental health care or their insurers simply refuse to cover      the required treatment. The majority of these families are      not eligible for Medicaid coverage because of their income.      Furthermore, there is a widespread lack of appropriate mental      health services for children and adolescents in most states      and communities which forces families to make desperate      choices.       Your legislation promises to improve access to the services      these families need to stay together by providing grants to      states to establish interagency systems of care for children      and adolescents with serious mental disorders. These grants      will allow states to build more efficient and effective      mental health systems for children and families. Your bill      also calls for the creation of a federal interagency task      force to examine mental health issues in the child welfare      and juvenile justice systems. This analysis is greatly needed      because, as you know, children who become wards of the state      in order to receive mental health services are generally      placed in the child welfare or juvenile justice systems even      though neither system is designed or intended to serve as a      mental health provider.       No family in our nation should ever be asked to make the      heart-wrenching decision to give up parental rights of their      seriously ill child in exchange for mental health treatment.      We welcome this legislation as a critical step toward ending      custody relinquishment and toward delivering more cost      effective and appropriate services for children and families.       Once again, we thank you for your leadership and commitment      to ending this practice and for continuing to stand up for      children and families.           Sincerely,                                            David L. Shern, Ph.D.,     President and CEO, Mental Health America.                                  ____                                              National Alliance on                                               Mental Illness,                                  Arlington, VA, January 18, 2007.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Tom Harkin,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Collins and Harkin: On behalf of the 210,000      members and 1,200 affiliates of the National Alliance on      Mental Illness, NAMI, I am writing to offer our strong      support for the Keeping Families Together Act, KFTA. As the      nation's largest organization representing families of      children and adolescents living with mental illness, NAMI is      proud to offer our support for this important legislation.       The KFTA represents a major step forward in helping to end      a national scandal that has lingered too long in states      throughout our nation. As you know, thousands of families      every year are forced to give up custody of a child to the      state in order to secure vitally necessary mental illness      treatment and support services. This unthinkable practice      tears families apart, devastates parents and caregivers and      leaves children feeling abandoned in their hour of greatest      need.       This practice occurs because most families have      discriminatory and restrictive caps on their private mental      health coverage or insurers fail to cover the required      treatment. The majority of these families are not eligible      for Medicaid coverage because of their income and assets.      This truly unfortunate practice also exists because of the      lack of appropriate mental health services in many states and      communities for children and adolescents with mental      disorders. This was well documented in President Bush's 2003      New Freedom Initiative Mental Health Commission report.       Your legislation would help end this growing crisis by      providing grants to states to establish interagency systems      of care for children and adolescents with serious mental      disorders. These grants would allow states to build more      efficient and effective mental health systems for children      and families. It would also. eliminate barriers to home and      community-based care for children by enabling a greater      number of children to receive mental health services under      the Section 1915(c) Medicaid home- and community-based      waiver. The waiver promises to make appropriate services      available to children in their homes and communities and      close to their loved ones at a considerable cost savings over      providing those services in an institutional setting.       The KFTA also creates a federal interagency task force to      examine how the child welfare and juvenile justice systems      serve children and adolescents with mental illness. A GAO      report released in April 2003 showed that when parents give      up custody of their child to secure mental health services,      those children are placed in one of these two systems--     neither of which is designed to be a mental health service      agency.       NAMI feels strongly that no family should ever be asked to      make the heart-wrenching decision to give up parental rights      of their seriously ill child in exchange for mental health      treatment and services. Thank you for your leadership and      commitment to ending this practice and for continuing to      stand up for children, families and common sense.           Sincerely,                                   Michael J. Fitzpatrick, M.S.W.,                                               Executive Director.
