Chairman, I have had conversations with Mr. Blunt and I have also had conversations with Mr. Obey, and I want to tell the Members of the House that it would be my intention if we complete this bill and we can complete the Legislative appropriations bill tonight in the next 5\1/2\ hours, then it would be my intention that we would not meet tomorrow.  I want all the Members to understand that we will complete the Legislative appropriations bill this week, but if we can complete both of those bills tonight, it would be my intention that we would not be meeting tomorrow.
