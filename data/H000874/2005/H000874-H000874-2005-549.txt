The happy circumstance is we both certainly agree on this procedure, that it needs to have a thorough airing and debate and discussion. There are strong views on either side of this issue and quite obviously the consequences of this bill are very substantial. Whether it passes or whether it fails, the consequences are substantial. So we appreciate the fact that there will be significant time to discuss and debate this issue.  Mr. Leader, I have two items left. The Head Start reauthorization has now, as you know, been marked up by the committee. I know it is not coming next week, and we will be out the week after that for the Memorial Day work period. Can you tell me when you might expect the Head Start reauthorization bill to come to the floor?  Mr. DeLAY. We do have a very, very full schedule over the next few weeks. As the gentleman knows and most of the Members know, the Appropriations Committee is trying their best to get all the appropriations bills out of the House before the July 4 break, so there is very little time between now and the Fourth of July to do other bills. We are considering the Head Start bill, but we do not have any immediate plans to consider the Head Start bill reauthorization and hope that we can get to it as soon as possible.
