As chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and author of the highway bill, I suggest there are titles of the bill that are not within the jurisdiction of my committee. One is the Finance Committee title. The title is not yet here, so we do not have that to consider at this time.  I think it would be more appropriate later on, after we receive the title, to debate that in the normal process of legislation.
