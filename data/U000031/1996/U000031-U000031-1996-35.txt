Speaker, today I would like to honor a man who has dedicated his career to the betterment of banking and has continually voiced the banking industry's message loud and clear to the Members of this Congress. At the beginning of May, Daniel R. Smith, chairman and CEO of First of America Bank Corp., will be retiring after four decades of service in the banking industry.  Throughout his career, Dan has made many contributions to the furtherance of constructive banking legislation. While he was president of the Michigan Bankers Association, legislation was passed that allowed statewide branching in Michigan. During his tenure as president of the American Bankers Association in 1994, interstate banking legislation, regulatory reform and bankruptcy legislation was passed. Dan also conceived an important market share study of the financial services business, which the ABA completed, that clearly demonstrates the continued strength of banks in their respective markets. He also previously chaired both the MBA's and the ABA's government relations councils and is currently a member of the Bankers Roundtable.  Dan spent the first 21 years of his banking career in the trust department for First National Bank and Trust Company of Michigan, which later become First of America Bank--Michigan. In 1974, he was elected to the bank's board of directors and became president of the Kalamazoo Bank in 1977. He was named president of First of America Bank Corp. in 1983 and CEO of the corporation in 1985. During his tenure as CEO, the company grew from $5 billion in assets and 255 branch offices in Michigan, to the 33d largest holding company in the country with $23 billion in assets and over 600 branch offices in Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Florida.  I would like to thank Dan for his strong leadership in the banking industry and his continued determination to reach beyond the traditional boundaries of banking.                          ____________________
