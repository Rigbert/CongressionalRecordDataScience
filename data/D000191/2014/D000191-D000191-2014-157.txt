Speaker, I want to thank one of my constituents, Laura Mason Caldwell of Eugene, Oregon, for her tireless advocacy on behalf of breast cancer patients. In large part thanks to Laura's work, we have a new law in Oregon that requires doctors to inform patients in writing if they have dense breast tissue. This is a small change that could have a major benefit. Dense breast tissue has been associated with increased risk of breast cancer, and routine mammograms are less likely to effectively detect tumors in women who have dense breast tissue. Had Laura been informed about these risk factors early on, she may have been able to catch her cancer before it spread. Oregonians now have that information, but women in many other states do not. For that reason House leadership needs to bring up the bipartisan Breast Density and Mammography Reporting Act, H.R. 3404, for a vote. Passing H.R. 3404 will make sure that women across the country have access to theinformation necessary to detect breast cancer early when it is most treatable.                          ____________________
