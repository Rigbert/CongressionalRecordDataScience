 The media center was remodeled last summer to fully envision the goal of delivering 21st century skills to both students and teachers. With a media classroom and three classroom areas all equipped with the technology-enhanced classroom model, the media center and learning commons are overflowing with teaching and learning on a daily basis. The media center is an active learning environment for the student population and is being used by approximately 4,000 students per week.  The media center's cutting-edge technology gives students the opportunity to work with and learn from off campus groups and experiences. With the help of social studies teacher Stacie Phillips, Jeanna Walker teamed with Western Michigan University's Haworth College of Business to bring online collaborative tools to Portage Northern American history classes. Also, access to live video conference capability gave students the ability to watch an autopsy through the Columbus Center for Science and Industry.  In honor of this national recognition, the media center will be featured on the American Association of School Libraries Vision Tour, an initiative by the association's President, Dr. Nancy Everhart, to visit school media centers across the United States in order to provide the public with examples of what exceptional school media centers offer students and communities.  On behalf of all residents of southwest Michigan, congratulations again to the Portage Northern High School Library Media Center, Media Specialist Jeanna Walker, and the entire Portage Community on this worthy achievement. Go Huskies!                          ____________________
