I would rather have them tonight.  I ask unanimous consent that at 5:30 today, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Lautenberg amendment No. 625 to be followed by a vote in relation to the Harkin amendment No. 618, with no second degrees in order to the amendments prior to the votes and with the time until then equally divided; provided further that there be 2 minutes equally divided for debate between the votes.
