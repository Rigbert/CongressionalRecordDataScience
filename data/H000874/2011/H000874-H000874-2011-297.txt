 I do not want to be argumentative, but I have just received your amended copy of the resolution, and as I read on your second page, it says ``the remainder of fiscal year 2011 that assumes non-security spending at fiscal year 2008 levels or less.''  The implication in that, it seems to me, is that Mr. Ryan unilaterally can set a number which has not been agreed to by the House, but under the power granted in this resolution would bind the House to a number to which it had never agreed.  Is that an accurate reading of that? Could, in fact, under this resolution Mr. Ryan set a number that is less than, as your resolution says, 2008 numbers?
