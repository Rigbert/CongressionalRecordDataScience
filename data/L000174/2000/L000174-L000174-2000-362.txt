President, I do not want to interrupt the discussion of the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from California. I am just curious, so we can have some idea of where we might be; yesterday, we had a problem. I understand the two proponents were out negotiating a new draft of this. But we had a situation where there were few on the floor.  I know the two proponents of this amendment, although they are on opposite sides from me, would agree that a constitutional amendment is far too consequential to be some kind of place holder on the Senate schedule. We have a number of Senators who will want to speak. They have asked me to speak. We have the distinguished dean of our party, my friend, the senior Senator from West Virginia, who will want to speak. We have had others who have.  I am just curious if the two Senators have some concept of where we may be on the schedule.
