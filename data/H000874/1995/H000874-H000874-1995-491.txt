Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, I join in the sadness and sorrow of the gentleman from Oklahoma, and I rise to express my strong support for this resolution that condemns the bombing attack on the men, women, and the children of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City.  This resolution sends a message that the Congress joins with the administration, no resolution can send it as strongly as every Member feels it or as every American feels it, but support for using all necessary means to find and bring to justice all those responsible for this unspeakable act.  As a member of the Committee on Appropriations I want to express my commitment to providing whatever resources are necessary to bring all those responsible to justice. And let no one be uncertain that punishment for anyone else who might try such as act in the future will also be swift and as severe as the law allows.  My prayers and the prayers of everybody in this Chamber and throughout this country are with the victims in Oklahoma, with their families, and with their friends and with their colleagues.  As a longtime supporter of our Nation's civil service, I am especially saddened, Mr. Speaker, by the horrific impact that this tragedy has had on the more than 500 Federal employees who worked at that building, and almost 2 million more who work around this country on behalf of their fellow citizens.  In my view, Mr. Speaker, Federal workers are one of our Nation's greatest assets. This ironically is Public Service Recognition Week, that special week each year when we recognize the enormous contribution that public employees at all levels of government make to the national well-being.  Like the Federal buildings scattered throughout the Nation, the Murrah Building was a microcosm of government. The jobs there reflect the broad spectrum of services that Americans expect from the Federal Government:  One hundred twenty-five workers at a Housing and Urban Development office to help citizens realize the greatest of Americans dreams--home ownership and affordable housing.  Sixty-one Social Security Administration employees getting benefits out and resolving questions and problems for the citizens of Oklahoma. At least 11 of those employees are dead, along with many of the estimated 35 members of the general public who were in the Social Security Administration office at the time of the blast.  Twenty-five Federal Highway Administration employees keeping transportation projects so critical to our economy and to our citizens on track.  Twenty-two Department of Agriculture employees giving aid and information out to farmers so that all Americans can have affordable, healthy food.  Seventeen Marine Corps employees who I am confident never thought that their little Oklahoma recruiting office would be blown up as if it were in a war zone. I understand that a group of New York firemen who had joined in the rescue effort, who are also Marine reservists, saluted as they carried one of their own from beneath the crushed concrete.  And perhaps, Mr. Speaker, most disturbing, the law enforcement officials who were stationed in the Murrah Building from the Secret Service, the Customs Service, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and, yes, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. ATF employees stationed in the building not only assisted in the rescue efforts but have worked with ATF's two national response teams that were deployed to Oklahoma City immediately after the bombing.  These are not nameless, faceless bureaucrats as some would project to the American public or folks that are just the enemy who we want to get who are what we want to undermine, get ride of them. America relies on these heads of families, these mothers of children, these children of others.  Their desire, Mr. Speaker, is to serve and is exemplified by an incredible news clip shared with me by the Department of the Army. Written by Tonya Riley-Rodriguez, it reads:       He stood beneath a tree which survived the blast and took a      long drink of bottled water.       I'm going to be here until they all--come home, ``said      Staff Sgt. Don M. Majors, a U.S. Army nurse recruiter.       I have worked in this building for 5\1/2\ years, and I knew      everybody.''       He slipped a surgical mask back up to his sweat-and-dirt-     covered face, ineffectually wiped at a streak of plaster on      his forehead, and turned to go under the collapsed building      again. He wasn't sure how long he had been searching that      day. ``Maybe 13 or 14 hours,'' he offered.  Mr. Speaker, this is the type of dedication we have seen from so many people in Oklahoma City since April 19. It is the spirit that so many Federal workers bring to their job day after day.  As we pass this resolution condemning this horrible act in Oklahoma City, I hope that all Members of this body will join with me in recognizing the tremendous commitment of Federal employees in Oklahoma City and across this Nation. And, yes, remember the brave citizens of Oklahoma and Oklahoma City. They are our brothers and they are our sisters, and if they are attacked, we are attacked. They are fellow Americans.  Let them know in Oklahoma that we are with them, let them know in Oklahoma, my friends who represent that great State, that we will march with you side by side to ensure their safety and to ensure that whatever is within our ability to make them whole, and only God can do that, of course, we will do.  I thank the gentleman for his time.                              {time}  1330
