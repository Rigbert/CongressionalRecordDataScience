Gen. Bruce Prunk. After 35 years of service to our Nation and the State of Oregon, General Prunk will retire from the Oregon National Guard. I know I speak for Oregonians across the State in thanking him for his service.  I got to know Bruce well during the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commissions, BRAC, process. He was a key player in leading the Oregon National Guard's efforts and working with my office to build an overwhelming business case for keeping the 142nd Fighter Wing open at the Portland Air National Guard Base. Everywhere you turned, it seemed like he was at community meetings, making media presentations, and doing outreach with elected officials and business leaders to build consensus. As a result of these herculean efforts, we successfully beat back Secretary Rumsfeld's recommendation to close the 142nd Fighter Wing, and the wing's airmen keep the skies of the Pacific Northwest safe to this day.  General Prunk enlisted in the Oregon Air National Guard in 1983 and worked his way up to serve in several high-level positions throughout the Oregon Air National Guard, including vice wing commander of the 142nd Fighter Wing, chief of staff for air at Joint Force Headquarters, and assistant adjutant general of the Oregon National Guard. He also held positions in the National Guard Bureau out in Washington, DC, serving as assistant and as special assistant to the Director of the Air National Guard. And I would be remiss if I didn't mention that Bruce volunteered to deploy to Iraq in 2007 with the 732nd Air Expeditionary Group, 332nd Air Expeditionary Wing and that he earned the Bronze Star for actions during that deployment.  Rising to the level of general is quite an accomplishment and enough of a career for most folks, but not Bruce. In his civilian life, he joined the Portland Police in 1976, working his way up to captain, then to commander, and finally to assistant chief of police. In these positions, he led community policing efforts, working with local leaders and elected officials to improve neighborhood livability in Portland. He retired from the Portland Police in 2004 and was able to devote more time to the Oregon National Guard.  I think General Prunk's career epitomizes the citizen-soldier envisioned by the Founders. His civilian service and long military career have given him an appreciation for the various challenges Oregon's National Guard soldiers and airmen face balancing family, employer, and often medical issues. His ability to bring different groups together to solve problems is perhaps best illustrated through his work with Camp Rosenbaum, a free camp on the Oregon coast for low-income, inner-city children. For over 25 years he has led efforts to build a unique partnership between police, public employees, and private sponsors to help thousands of at-risk young people go to Camp Rosenbaum.  From his work on the BRAC recommendations to his service in the Portland Police to his involvement with Oregon's military crisis hotline on suicide prevention, General Prunk has just about done it all. Oregon is grateful for all of his hard work on the State's behalf and for the leadership he has displayed over his long and decorated career. It has been a privilege to get to know such a dedicated public official, and I want to thank him for his many years of outstanding service. His retirement will be a loss to Oregon, but we wish him a long, happy, and healthy retirement.                          ____________________
