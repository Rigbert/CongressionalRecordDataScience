 President, in response to the Senator's question, for technical purposes, I agree with him 100 percent. I am an admirer of the Senator from Virginia, in no small part because he was in combat, because he was in the military and because he knows, I suspect, what it feels like sitting there, figuratively speaking, strapped in waiting for an order.  I am always very reluctant to argue a position that may get somebody killed, may get somebody maimed, may get someone put in a prison camp. And men like Senator Kerrey, a Congressional Medal of Honor winner, and Senator McCain, who argued against my position for years on Bosnia--not Kosovo; Bosnia--when men who are brave like that, men like Danny Inouye, Senator Chafee, and Senator Hollings, my seatmate, when they have questions about this, I take it very, very seriously.
