President, I know everyone stands riveted to hear the rest of my speech. I was trying to complete the speech so the Senator from California could be recognized.  Mr. President, sometimes after all this work, the Senate actually does work. Those who are watching someday will explain what exactly has happened.  To continue, the Senate has already confirmed 140 of this President's judicial nominees, including 27 circuit court nominees. We could have confirmed at least five more this week if the Republican leadership would have worked with us to schedule votes on them. That stands in sharp contrast to the treatment of President Clinton's nominees by a Republican-controlled Senate from 1995 through 2001, when judicial vacancies on the Federal courts were more than doubling from 16 to 33.  Opposition to Mr. Pryor's nomination is shared by a wide spectrum of objective observers. Mr. Pryor's record is so out of the mainstream that, even before last month's hearing, a number of editorial boards and others weighed in with significant opposition.  Last April, even the Washington Post, which has been exceedingly generous to the Administration's efforts to pack the courts, termed Mr. Pryor ``unfit''. Both the Tuscaloosa News and the Hunstville Times wrote in early May against the nomination. Other editorial boards across the country spoke out, including the San Jose Mercury News and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Since the hearing, that chorus of opposition has only grown and now includes the New York Times, the Charleston Gazette, the Arizona Daily Star and the Los Angeles Times. I ask unanimous consent to print the full package of these editorials and op-eds in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, April 11, 2003]                             Unfit To Judge       President Bush must have worked hard to dream up an      escalation of the judicial nomination wars as dramatic as his      decision this week to nominate Alabama Attorney General Bill      Pryor to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. A      protege of Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions, Mr. Pryor      is a parody of what Democrats imagine Mr. Bush to be plotting      for the federal courts. We have argued strongly in favor of      several Mr. Bush's nominees--and urged fair and swift      consideration of all. And we have criticized Democratic      attacks on nominees of substance and quality. But we have      also urged Mr. Bush to look for common ground on judicial      nominations, to address legitimate Democratic grievances and      to seek nominees of such stature as defies political      objection. The Pryor nomination shows that Mr. Bush has other      ideas.       Mr. Pryor is probably best known as a zealous advocate of      relaxing the wall between church and state. He teamed up with      one of Pat Robertson's organizations in a court effort to      defend student-led prayer in public schools, and he has      vocally defended Alabama's chief justice, who has insisted on      displaying the Ten Commandments in state court facilities.      But his career is broader. He has urged the repeal of a key      section of the Voting Rights Act, which he regards as ``an      affront to federalism and an expensive burden.'' He has also      called Roe v. Wade ``the worst abomination of constitutional      law in our history.'' Whatever one thinks of Roe, it is      offensive to rank it among the court's most notorious cases,      which include Dred Scott and Plessy v. Ferguson, after all.       Mr. Pryor's speeches display a disturbingly politicized      view of the role of courts. He has suggested that impeachment      is an appropriate remedy for judges who ``repeatedly and      recklessly . . . overturn popular will and . . . rewrite      constitutional law.'' And he talks publicly about judging in      the vulgarly political terms of the current judicial culture      war. He concluded one speech, for example, with the following      prayer: ``Please, God, no more Souters''--a reference to the      betrayal many conservatives feel at the honorable career of      Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter.       Mr. Pryor has bipartisan support in Alabama, and he worked      to repeal the provisions in that state's constitution that      forbade interracial marriage. Bush this is not a nomination      the White House can sell as above politics. Mr. Bush cannot      at once ask for apolitical consideration of his nominees and      put forth nominees who, in word and deed, turn federal courts      into political battlegrounds. If he sends the Senate nominees      such as Mr. Pryor, he cannot complain too loudly when his      nominees receive the most researching scrutiny.                                  ____               [From the Tuscaloosanews.com, May 4, 2003]                 Pryor's Opinion Goes Beyond Mainstream       Attorney General Bill Pryor's opinion that lumps      homosexuality in with abusive crimes such as child      pornography, bestiality, incest and pedophilia puts him well      within the camp of recent nominees to the federal bench but      well outside the mainstream of American life.       Pryor was nominated by President Bush to a seat on the U.S.      Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, which has jurisdiction      over Alabama, Georgia and Florida. A legal argument Pryor      wrote earlier this year, which just came to light last week,      parallels comments by Sen. Rick Santorum, that landed the      Pennsylvania Republican in hot water recently.       The amicus brief, penned by Pryor and signed by attorneys      for South Carolina and Utah, declared that states' support      for the Texas sodomy law in the Supreme Court case of      Lawrence vs. Texas, which the court is expected to decide in      June or July. Pryor argues the Texas law should be upheld,      otherwise constitutional protections ``must logically extend      to activities like prostitution, adultery, necrophilia,      bestiality, possession of child pornography, and even incest      and pedophilia (if the child should credibly claim to be      `willing').''       Hardly so.       It is a long step from sanctioning, or even tolerating,      consensual private activity between two adults to permitting      abusive crimes such as pedophilia. The law is perfectly      capable of drawing such distinctions in theory and in      practice.       We have cautiously supported Pryor's nomination, while      taking issue with a number of his controversial positions.      These include his defense of state Supreme Court Chief      Justice Roy Moore's decision to display the Ten Commandments      in the state Judicial Building, his opposition to multi-state      lawsuits against tobacco companies and his defense of utility      companies in upgrading their coal-fired power plants without      adding new pollution control devices.       Several of Bush's nominees for federal bench hold extreme      anti-gay views. Timony Tymkovich, confirmed to an appeals      court last month, has compared homosexuality to cockfighting,      bestiality, prostitution and suicide.       Pryor's confirmation hearings have not yet been set. The      Judicial Committee will certainly want an explanation of his      incendiary comments, which unfortunately are typical of the      nominees they will be asked to consider.                                  ____                [From the Huntsville Times, May 4, 2003]                           Pryor's Preaching       Churches promote faith; courtrooms promote justice.       Attorney General Bill Pryor usually has been what few      Alabama politicians seem to know how to be: principled.      Though unabashedly a conservative Republican, Pryor has      usually been more nonpartisan than partisan.       More than once, he has ignored the prevailing political      winds to do what he thought was right. Trying to reform the      state's sentencing system is a prime example. One that he      thought was right again. But this time Pryor has gotten it      wrong.       In a ``friend of the court'' brief filed almost three      months ago regarding the Texas sodomy case before the U.S.      Supreme Court, Pryor compared homosexual acts to      ``prostitution, adultery, necrophilia, bestiality, possession      of child pornography, and even incest and pedophilia.''       This is the same case, of course, the Pennsylvania Sen.      Rick Santorum, another conservative Republican, made      similarly troubling remarks about.       The problem here is neither that Pryor has a certain point      of view that others may not share, nor that he expressed it.      In the United States, we all have a right to think and speak      freely.       The problem is that as the attorney general of Alabama--and      President Bush's nominee to the 11th Circuit Court of      Appeals--Pryor did not separate his personal moral views from      his public role as a promoter of justice.       Bill Pryor has championed causes that many Republicans and      not a few Democrats would probably have walked away from:      such as the removal of the interracial marriage ban from the      state constitution and the recruitment of mentors for      underprivileged children, to mention a few.       Alabama has benefited from having him as attorney general,      and would probably benefit if he decided to seek an even      higher elected office one day.       Perhaps the nation would too, but not if Pryor plans to use      a judicial appointment as an opportunity to give his moral      points of view the heft of the law's brief seems to be a part      of a trend to infuse public policy and the law with morality      of an abashedly religious strain.       Until God--or whoever or whatever it is you do or do not      worship--decides to clarify the myriad matters of faith that      have caused us to separate into different churches, temples,      mosques, sects, and beliefs, it would be best for those who      believe to enjoy their beliefs in a way that allows others to      enjoy theirs--or to enjoy not having any beliefs at all.       Churches are supposed to promote faith, and courtrooms,      justice. If Pryor is confirmed to the 11th Circuit, he would      do well to honor this distinction.                                  ____             [From the San Jose Mercury News, May 21, 2003]                           Coup in the Courts       President Bush has treated judicial nominations like tax      cuts: Declare, with a straight face, that the extreme is      reasonable and that any opponent is obstructionist.       In the case of judgeships, that means nominating one      conservative ideologue after another, knowing that Democrats      in a Republican Senate have neither the will nor a way to      challenge and defeat most of them.       Instead, the Democrats have picked their shots--and they      should continue to do that.       Contrary to his protestations, Bush has had tremendous      success. In his first 28 months of office, the Senate has      approved 121 of his nominations--better than President      Clinton averaged over his administration. Bush has named one      out of seven active federal judgeships.       What's at stake is whether Bush will be able to stuff the      federal courts with judges narrow in their view of minority      and women's rights, staunch in opposition to abortion, and      intent on overturning decisions that have been long accepted      by the courts and the public.       Individuals like James Leon Holmes, nominated to a federal      court in Arkansas, who has written that the role of a woman      ``is to place herself under the authority of the man.'' And      Alabama Attorney General Bill Pryor, who characterized Roe v.      Wade, the decision establishing a right to an abortion, as      ``the worst abomination of constitutional law in our      history.''       The latest troubling nomination is that of Los Angeles      Superior Court Judge Carolyn Kuhl to the 9th Circuit Court of      Appeals. That court is the ultimate authority, save for the      U.S. Supreme Court, for a huge swath of the West, including      California.       As an eager young lawyer in the Reagan administration, Kuhl      fought the IRS to retain a tax-exempt status for Bob Jones      University despite its record of religious and racial      discrimination. The Supreme Court later overturned that      decision 8-1. As a deputy attorney general, she co-wrote a      brief calling on the Supreme Court to overturn Roe. v. Wade.      Three years ago, she dismissed the suit of a breast-cancer      patient who claimed a violation of privacy after a drug-     company salesman watched her examination without her      permission. That appallingly insensitive ruling was also      overturned.       Kuhl has plenty of supporters among lawyers, including      Democrats, who say she's a good trial judge. If so, that's      where she should stay--not placed on an appeals court where      decisions are binding an all lower courts.       Both home state senators, Barbara Boxer and Dianne      Feinstein, oppose Kuhl's appointment; traditionally, that's      been enough to sink a nomination. But Senate Republicans are      pushing ahead, after slipping by the Judiciary Committee on a      party-line vote.       Democrats have used the filibuster to delay two nominations      to federal appeals courts, that of Washington attorney Miguel      Estrada and Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen.       Bush deserves the right to appoint capable, smart,      conservative judges. But senators must exercise their      constitutional veto over nominees whose values and judicial      philosophy are way out of the mainstream.                                  ____           [From the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, July 20, 2003]                         Not Fit for the Bench                alabama's pryor is a walking stereotype       The problem with Senate Republicans during the Clinton      administration was that they too often assumed the      president's nominations to the federal bench were wild-eyed      liberals. Now that a Republican president is in the White      House, the Democrats and their friends are playing tit-for-     tat by viewing Mr. Bush's nominations as reactionary by      definition.       The Post-Gazette has deplored these tendencies, which have      made it difficult to sort out the slanderous caricatures from      the solid characters. It is why we rose strongly to the      defense last year of Western Pennsylvania's D. Brooks Smith,      a Republican nominee who was eventually confirmed for an      appeals court seat after seeing his record distorted by      liberal special-interest groups.       One trouble with crying wolf is that, just as in the old      story, sometimes a real wolf turns up. Such a one is Alabama      Attorney General Bill Pryor, whom The Washington Post      observed in an editorial ``is a parody of what Democrats      imagine Bush to be plotting for the federal courts.''       If Mr. Pryor is confirmed for a seat on the 11th U.S.      Circuit Court of Appeals, he will be well placed to begin      preying on a number of settled legal precedents and      doctrines. Roe v. Wade? ``The worst abomination in the      history of constitutional law'' in the United States, he      said. Separation of church and state? He's cozy with the      religious right, so he looks favorably on such things as the      display of the Ten Commandments on public property. Protect      the environment? Mr. Pryor thinks the feds should get out of      that business and leave it to the states.       And so it goes with this reactionary's reactionary, who      would be in the mainstream only if it were far to the right.       On Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee put off voting      on Mr. Pryor's nomination amid concerns raised about his      fund-raising activities for the Republican Attorneys General      Association, specifically focusing on how accurately he      answered the committee's questions.       This is no small matter, but it was dismissed as ``pure      politics, pure and simple'' by Committee Chairman Sen. Orrin      Hatch, R-Utah. In a sense, he was right, except that the      process began in the White House. This nomination is entirely      political, meant to curry favor with President Bush's right-     wing constituency.       The delay represents an opportunity for Pennsylvania's Sen.      Arlen Specter, who has a reputation for reason and moderation      but has been fretting for days about exposing his flank to a      right-wing challenger in the primary. Whatever happens with      the fund-raising questions. Sen. Specter and the others have      before them a self-confirming stereotype who should be      opposed.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, July 23, 2003]                     An Extremist Judicial Nominee       The Senate Judiciary Committee could vote as early as today      on the nomination of the Alabama attorney general, William      Pryor, to a federal appeals court judgeship. Mr. Pryor is      among the most extreme of the Bush administration's far-right      judicial nominees. If he is confirmed, his rulings on civil      rights, abortion, gay rights and the separation of church and      state would probably do substantial harm to rights of all      Americans. Senators from both parties should oppose his      confirmation.       Mr. Pryor, who has been nominated for a seat on the Federal      Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, based in Atlanta, has      views that fall far outside the political and legal      mainstream. He has called Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion-     rights ruling, ``the worst abomination'' of constitutional      law in our history. He recently urged the Supreme Court to      uphold laws criminalizing gay sex, a position the court      soundly rejected last month. He has defended the installation      of a massive Ten Commandments monument in Alabama's main      judicial building, which a federal appeals court recently      held violated the First Amendment. And he has urged Congress      to repeal an important part of the Voting Rights Act.       Moderates in the Senate and in the legal community have      repeatedly called on the Bush administration to stop trying      to stack the federal judiciary with far-right partisans like      Mr. Pryor. But the White House and its supporters have chosen      instead to lash out at these reasonable critics. In a      shameful bit of demagoguery, a group founded by Boyden Gray,      a White House counsel under the first President George Bush,      has run newspaper ads accusing Mr. Pryor's critics in the      Senate of opposing him because he is Catholic.       At today's committee meeting, much of the attention will be      on Arlen Spector, the Pennsylvania Republican who could cast      the deciding vote. Mr. Specter owes it to his constituents to      break with the White House and vote against Mr. Pryor, whose      extremist views are out of step with most Pennsylvanians'.      Standing up for an independent, nonideological judiciary is      an urgent cause, and one that should find support on both      sides of the aisle.                                  ____              [From the Charleston Gazette, June 30, 2003]                      Extremist Far-Right Nominee       President Bush hopes to pack the federal judiciary with      numerous ultraconservative appointees who eventually will      revoke women's right to choose abortion--a goal of the      Republican national platform--and make other legal changes      desired by the party's ``religious right'' wing.       Many of the White House appointees are evasive about their      personal views when questioned at Senate confirmation      hearings. But one of them, Alabaman William Pryor, nominated      to the Atlanta circuit court, has     such an inflammatory record that he can't hide his extreme      beliefs.       He told the senators that allowing women to choose abortion      is ``morally wrong'' and this freedom has caused ``the      slaughter of millions of unborn children.'' He said he once      refused to take his family to Disney World on a day that gays      attended, because his personal ``value judgment'' dictated      it.       In the past, he has sneered at the U.S. Supreme Court as      ``nine octogenarian lawyers'' because the justices delayed an      execution that Pryor desired.       The New York Times commented:       ``As Alabama attorney general, Mr. Pryor has turned his      office into a taxpayer-financed right-wing law firm. He has      testified to Congress in favor of dropping a key part of the      Voting Rights Act. In a Supreme Court case challenging the      Violence Against Women Act, 36 state attorneys general urged      the court to uphold the law. Mr. Pryor was the only one to      argue that the law was unconstitutional. This term, he      submitted a brief in favor of a Texas law that makes gay sex      illegal, comparing it to necrophilia, bestiality, incest and      pedophilia. . . .       ``If a far-right legal group needs a lawyer to argue      extreme positions against abortion, women's rights, gay      rights and civil rights, Mr. Pryor may be a suitable      candidate. But he does not belong on the federal bench.''       Where on Earth does Bush find such narrow-minded nominees--     from TV evangelist shows? It will be tragic if America's      federal courts become dominated by one-sided, puritanical      judges far out of step with the majority of people.       Senate Democrats are threatening filibusters to block the      worst of Bush's judicial appointees. Republicans want to      change Senate rules, banning filibusters when judges are up      for confirmation. We hope that West Virginia's senators,      Robert C. Byrd and Jay Rockefeller, do their utmost to hold      the line against extremist judges.                                  ____              [From the Arizona Daily Star, June 14, 2003]                           Deny the Ideologue       President Bush continues his quest to pack the American      judicial system with ideologically driven, conservative      activists who simply are unfit to take a seat on the nation's      appellate courts. The latest is William H. Pryor, the Alabama      Attorney General.       Pryor's nomination to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals is      outrageous. It is designed, as are the president's other      ideological nominations, to appeal to the base instincts of      the right-wing, conservative Christian element of the      Republican Party.       Pryor makes no attempt to distance himself from his      outlandish comments. He has said that if a Texas law      outlawing homosexual sex were overturned, it would open the      door to legalized ``prostitution, adultery, necrophilia,      bestiality, possession of child pornography and even invest      and pedophilia.''       That statement is breathtakingly bigoted.       But Pryor is a multi-dimensional ideologue. Here's his      stance on Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision allowing      abortion: The law is ``an abominable decision'' and ``the      worse abomination in the history of constitutional law.'' He      opposes abortion even in the case of rape.       Though these are his personal opinions about legal      decisions, he says, he would uphold the law as an appellate      court judge. That is disingenuous, at best. He admitted      during a Senate hearing that in a meeting with a conservative      group, he ended by saying a ``prayer for the next      administration: Please, God, no more Souters.''       David Souter, a Supreme Court justice appointed by the      first President Bush, is widely scourned by conservatives      because he is a moderate rather than a conservative Supreme      Court justice.       Only once during questioning before the Senate Judiciary      hearing on his nomination did Pryor backtrack on previous      remarks. He admitted he made an inappropriate remark when he      referred to the Supreme Court as ``nine octogenarian lawyers      who happen to sit on the Supreme Court.'' He made the comment      after the Court issued a stay of execution in his state. They      stay was issued in order to determine whether the use of the      electric chair was unconstitutional.       His background also includes efforts to allow students-led      prayers in schools; defense of an Alabama judge who displays      the 10 Commandments in his courtroom; and support of Alabama      prison guards who handcuff prisoners to hitching posts during      the summer.       Civil rights activists signed a letter arguing against      Pryor's confirmation. The letter said the group was alarmed      that Pryor ``. . . is not only an avowed proponent of the      modern states rights movement, now called federalism, but he      has also asked Congress to `repeal or amend' Section 5 of the      Voting Rights Act, which he said is an `affront to      federalism.' '' The section requires Justice Department      approval to changes in voting procedures made by states.       This ideologue is also delusional. Pryor believes that only      guilty people are executed in this country. The judicial      system, he said, has ``extraordinary safeguards, many      safeguards.'' Further, he said, ``the system catches      errors.''       One of the benefits of nominating a right-winger like Pryor      is that the president gets valuable political points for it.      Even if Pryor is not confirmed by the Senate, and he should      not be, the president still wins. In this age of cynical      politics, Bush will get credit among the most distasteful      elements of his party for nominating one of their own for a      seat on the bench. It will serve him well when he runs for      re-election.                                  ____              [From the Los Angeles Times, June 30, 2003]                       Skewed Picture of America       By nominating William H. Pryor Jr. to the federal appeals      court, George Bush has declared that the Alabama attorney      general is not only qualified to sit on the nation's second-     highest court but is the kind of judge most Americans want.      Senators should reject this implausible assessment.       Even though the Senate has already confirmed 132 judges,      pushing court vacancies to a 13-year low, the White House      still complains about delays. Go-along-to-get-along      Republicans may want to approve Pryor rather than buck their      president.       But the appointment of Pryor, 41, to a lifetime seat on the      U.S. Court of Appeals would be an endorsement of an ominous      view of American law. At this month's Senate Judiciary      Committee hearing, he defended--even amplified on--his      disturbing views. His candor is refreshing but it leaves      squirming senators no cover.       ``Congress . . . should not be in the business of public      education nor the control of street crime,'' he has argued, a      position at odds with Bush's education initiative and support      for beefed-up law enforcement and tougher criminal penalties.       Pryor contends that the Constitution does not grant the      federal government power to protect the environment. He      regards Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision      upholding the legal right to an abortion, as ``the worst      abomination of constitutional law in our history'' and hopes      that the landmark ruling will be overturned.       He would urge repeal of the 1965 Voting Rights Act      requirement that the federal government review state and      local changes to voting procedures that may affect      minorities. It's ``an affront to federalism and an expensive      burden,'' Pryor believes.       Before the Supreme Court last week struck down Texas' anti-     sodomy statute, he argued for upholding that law and another      like it in Alabama. If the Constitution protects the choice      of a sexual partner, he contends, it also permits      ``prostitution, adultery, necrophilia, bestiality . . . and      even incest and pedophilia.'' He also believes that the 1st      Amendment's establishment clause should permit a two-ton      granite representation of the Ten Commandments to sit in an      Alabama courthouse.       These views and Pryor's lack of judicial experience caused      the American Bar Assn. to splinter over his fitness for the      appeals seat.       With the Senate already having confirmed so many of Bush's      picks for the federal bench, there's no argument for this      unqualified nominee.
