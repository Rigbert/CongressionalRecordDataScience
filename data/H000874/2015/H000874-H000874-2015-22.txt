Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy) for the purpose of inquiring of the majority leader the schedule of the week to come.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and2 p.m. for legislative business. No votes are expected in the House in order to accommodate Members going to the White House event.  On Tuesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and noon for legislative business. Members are advised that the first votes of the week are expected mid-afternoon on Tuesday.  On Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and noon for legislative business. On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.  Last votes of the week are still to be determined, but Members are encouraged to keep their schedules flexible as we approach the end of the year.  Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business tomorrow. Included will be a bill to make urgent and necessary changes to the Visa Waiver Program.  H.R. 158, sponsored by Representative Candice Miller, will close loopholes in the visa waiver system to prevent terrorists from exploiting the system to come to America to wreak havoc.  The House has identified a host of recommendations to improve the visa waiver system in a bipartisan way. I do want to thank the gentleman for his work and cooperation on this critical bill.  In addition, the House will consider H.R. 2130, the Red River Private Property Protection Act, sponsored by Representative Mac Thornberry, which will provide legal certainty to property owners in Texas.  Mr. Speaker, the House may also consider the conference report to H.R. 644, the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015, as well as a bill to extend certain provisions of the Tax Code.  Additionally, it is possible that the House will consider an omnibus appropriations act.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, the House may also consider budget reconciliation, if the Senate acts on that measure.                              {time}  1330
