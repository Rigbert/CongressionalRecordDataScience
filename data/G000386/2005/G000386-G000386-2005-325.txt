  We can restore what we cut to family farmers in the resolution. We can allow young farmers to get into farming and lessen dependence on Federal subsidies. I hope my colleagues will support this commonsense amendment.  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time. I ask people who want to speak in support of the amendment to please come to the floor so we can expedite this debate.  I might say that I have all sorts of respect for the Senator from Georgia. He is a tough competitor.
