  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman previously spoke a lot about energy independence. I support energy independence with alternative energy, energy conservation, and a whole host of other things.  I did vote against the amendment to strike money from real investigation and real research earlier in energy efficiency on an amendment previously. But this is giving more money to the oil industry which is engaged with its OPEC partners in price fixing.  I wonder if the gentleman is a cosponsor of my legislation to require the President, the Metcalf legislation, of which I am a cosponsor, to require the President to file a WTO complaint against their WTO illegal price-fixing activities.  They are proud of it. The president of Venezuela says, hey, we are restraining production, we are fixing prices, and we are sticking it to the Americans. And our President and this Congress is silent on the issue.  Giving $53 million to a multihundred-billion-dollar industry, which is price fixing with overseas partners, is not good. Do my colleagues think they are not happy with the high price of oil? Do my colleagues think that this money is being spent to bring down the price of oil, $53 million would bring down the price of oil?
