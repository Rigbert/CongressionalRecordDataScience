I will be back to rejoin him in a few minutes. I do so appreciate my colleague's stamina and passion.  I went to school on a basketball scholarship, and I think I have been able to stay in a little bit of shape, but my friend from Kentucky has sure shown both his commitment and his stamina. I am going to have to take a brief meeting on one of the issues pending, but I intend to join my colleague here before too long.  I thank the Senator. I will have additional questions at that time.  I return the floor to Senator Paul.
