 Speaker, today I recognize the outstanding work done by participants in my Student Congressional Town Meeting held this summer. These participants were part of a group of high school students from around Vermont who testified about the concerns they have as teenagers, and about what they would like to see government do regarding these concerns.  On Behalf of Hillary Knapp and Christine Harvey--Regarding Healthy               Choices During the Teens Years, May 7, 2001       Hillary Knapp. In January, Otter Teen Network helped      organize and run a peer leadership project, with the help of      Green Mountain Prevention Project.       Christine Harvey. Otter Teen is a student-initiated and run      organization that invites teens to work together to create a      safe environment and positive school community at Otter      Valley. And OTM encourages young students to develop      leadership skills, have fun, and be high on life, not      alcohol, tobacco or other dangerous drugs. One of OTM's goals      is to empower individuals to respect themselves and others,      and not give in to negative peer pressure. There are no      membership requirements. All student and faculty are already      members. As a member, you can become involved as much or as      little as you desire.       Hillary Knapp. Peer Leadership Project is where certain      kids from the school go and have leadership training for one      weekend. And Green Mountain Prevention projects provided a      facilitator, Workshop-presenter and team-building games.      Through the PLP, we generated interest among the middle      school students to get involved with planning and carrying      out of our Power of Choice Day.       Christine Harvey. Our Power of Choice Day was a day where      we had workshops for students to go to instead of regular      classes, and the workshops were on healthy choices and the      power you have to make your own choices.       Hillary Knapp. Students came to our Power of Choice Day      thinking that it was going to be really boring and they were      just going to sit there. And as they went to the workshops      and did all the Activities we had, they found that it was      interesting and they liked the day. The preliminary results      of the survey for the day showed that the vast majority of      the students enjoyed the day and found it somewhat to be      useful in their everyday life.       Christine Harvey. We have a packet on all the stuff that we      did during the day, and some pictures.                                  ____                                   On Behalf of Josh Smolkin--Regarding Legalizing Cannabis, May 7, 2001       Josh Smolkin. My name is Joshua Smolkin. Thank you for      letting me speak here. Cannabis legalization has been      increasingly popular. This push is misunderstood by those who      discredit and close their ears to the cause. This push has      not come from people who merely wish to walk down the street      and smoke a joint without getting apprehended. It comes from      intelligent individuals who wish to make as much use of a      significant resource as humanly possible. Cannabis is the      only plant that has resilient enough growing habits, frugal      value, and the versatility to provide all the basic      necessities of life while helping to save our ecosystem and      supply all the energy we would ever need. I feel it is in our      best interest to legalize cannibus. Hemp is a form of the      cannabis plant that does not contain enough      tetrahydracanibinol, or THC, the psychoactive chemical found      in cannabis, to get an individual high. It would astonish me      as to why we have been confronted with so many problems      whenever there is an attempt to use it industrially. That is,      it would astonish me if I did not know that it is because      hemp poses a huge threat to the timber and oil companies,      both of which exert huge influence within the United States.      Hemp can be effectively made into all sorts of energy      products that are practically sulfur-free and cleaner burning      than currently used national resources such as crude oil, its      by-products, and coal. It can be easily made into a biomass      form of charcoal and gasoline. While when burnt, it will      release carbon dioxide, while it is growing, it uses up      CO2, creating more of a balance. I am convinced      cannabis is one of our prime allies in the fight against the      greenhouse effect and pollution. This possibility is      definitely not given enough credence. I guess it is a      horrible thing to explore likely ways to save our ecosystem.      The truth is, our oil supplies are not going to last that      much longer. Why destroy our world for the hundred some-odd      years it will take for our oil to be depleted, at which point      we will just have to run to a savior such as hemp our of      necessity? Pulped hemp is a prime candidate for paper      production. The cannabis plant has four times as much paper-     usable pulp per acre as trees do. Furthermore, it grows back      in about four months. Hemp fibers are very long, and grow in      the organically binding glue found in plant cells, allowing      for environmentally safe chlorine-free bleaching. These      fibers can be made into various household items and clothing,      far superior to cotton in durability, insulation, UV      protection, and is easy to                               ____________________
