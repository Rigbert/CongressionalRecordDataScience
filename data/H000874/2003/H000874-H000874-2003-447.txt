Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his information.  Following up on what he said at the end of his statement, am I to understand that if the supplemental is passed on Thursday, it is the gentleman's expectation we will not be in next Friday?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield, the gentleman is correct. If we can get the supplemental passed by the House by Thursday, we would not be in on Friday. But Members need to be advised that the President has asked the bipartisan leadership to try to get the supplemental to his desk before the Easter break, and we have to get it done next week in order to accomplish that.
