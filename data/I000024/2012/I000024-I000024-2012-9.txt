President, I have been a consistent advocate for human rights around the world and support ensuring that the world is accessible to those with disabilities. However, I do not support the cumbersome regulations and potentially overzealous international organizations with anti-American biases that infringe upon American sovereignty.  If we had not passed what I consider to be the gold standard for the disabled--and I do remember at that time the activity of the Senator from Massachusetts very strongly supporting it. But we have done our job. Other nations maybe haven't, but in our case I think we are looked upon by the outside as doing the responsible thing within our Nation: taking care of our own disabled.
