Speaker, it is my great honor to call attention to the School City of Hammond and the Parent Advisory Council of the bilingual education program for holding its Spring Multicultural Festival. This year's festival, entitled ``Linking Worlds,'' will be held today, March 29, 1996 at the Dynasty Ballroom and Conference Center in Hammond, IN.  The School City of Hammond possesses a population that is rich in diversity of backgrounds and languages. This is reflected in the growth of families with a native language other than English. From 1970 to 1990, the number of students from non-English-speaking homes has grown from 977 to 2,306. To meet the needs of these students, the School City of Hammond proposed and received a grant from the U.S. Department of Education, which was implemented in September, 1991.  The mission of the School City of Hammond Bilingual Education Program is to provide a quality education for all students requiring language skill development. The program implements individualized instruction with an emphasis on reading and language arts in the English language. All skills are reinforced by computer. While the focus of the School City of Hammond is English instruction, the bilingual education program also provides the opportunity to learn up to 33 other languages.  I would like to recognize the following administrators and board members who make this incredible program possible. The Hammond School Board of Trustees includes: Mrs. Rebecca Ward, president; Mrs. Albertine M. Dent, vice-president; Mrs. Linda C. Lawson, secretary; Dr. David O. Dickson, superintendent; Mr. Gerald J. Mazur; and Mr. Jay K. Potesta.  The School City of Hammond Bilingual Education Program staff includes: Ms. Peggy Dellahoussaye-Kroc, director, Ms. Elena Rivera-Cruz; resource coordinator; Ms. Graciela Kamer, parent coordinator; Mr. Piedad Kerr, language assessor; and Ms. Nilsa Santiago, divisional secretary.  The Parent Advisory Council includes: Ms. Rosa Leyva, president; Ms. Teresa Turrubiates, secretary; Ms. Josefina Acosta, assistant secretary; Ms. Agustina Alcantar, treasury; Ms. Norma Solis and honorary members, Ms. Norma Solis, and Mr. Guadalupe Turrubiates.  The success rate of the bilingual program has been phenomenal. Within 3 years, the program has expanded from serving 2 schools to 13 schools. Moreover, the School City of Hammond now has the largest limited English proficient population in northwest Indiana, and the bilingual program has prompted an outpouring of support from the Hispanic community for student activities, including a small folklore dance group. Furthermore, the program has collaborated with businesses, including American Maize, and NBD and Calumet National Banks.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in a heartfelt message of congratulations to the School City of Hammond and the Parent Advisory Council for their celebrated success with the bilingual education program. This truly shows that a school system and parental group can work harmoniously together to produce a beneficial program for everyone in Indiana's First Congressional District. The members of this collaborative project should be proud of their efforts to successfully preserve all ethnic cultures.                          ____________________
