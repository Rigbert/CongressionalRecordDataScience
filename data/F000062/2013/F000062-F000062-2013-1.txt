 President, I rise today to introduce the Inyo National Forest Land Exchange Act.  This legislation will facilitate a land exchange between the operators of the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area in the Eastern Sierra Nevada region of California and the Inyo National Forest. Enactment of this bill will allow the ski resort to redevelop the parcel of land it currently leases from Forest Service, while providing the Forest Service with a combination of high resource value lands and a cash payment equal to the value of the exchanged land.  Since the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area, LLC, MMSA, began operations in 1953, Mammoth Mountain has grown to be one of the most popular ski areas in the United States, attracting up to two million visitors a year.  However, the Main Lodge area, which is located on approximately 21 acres of land leased by MMSA, has become outdated and inadequate to meet visitor needs. The Main Lodge building and Mammoth Mountain Inn are now more than 50 years old and require significant improvements and upgrades. Insufficient employee housing, parking and guest amenities must be corrected and skier staging and lift line queuing areas must be modernized. In order to make the necessary long-term investments, resort operators are seeking fee title to the land and have been working with the Inyo National Forest since 1998 to complete a land exchange.  Equal-value land exchanges involving Forest Service land are permitted under the Exchange Act. However, the typical land exchange procedures do not conform well to this particular exchange due to the complexity, size and scarcity of large, high resource value parcels in the Inyo National Forest. Consequently, this legislation would authorize a one-time exception to the Exchange Act to accomplish the proposed land exchange. Specifically, the bill would require the Secretary of Agriculture to acquire two parcels of private land outside, totaling approximately 1,500 acres, the boundary the Inyo National Forest in exchange for the conveyance of the 21 acre parcel within the forest currently leased to MMSA; accept a cash equalization payment in excess of the 25 percent value of the federal lands to fully compensate the Forest Service for the exchanged lands; and use the cash payment to acquire land or interests in land for additions to the National Forest System as such lands become available.  This bill will provide both economic and environmental benefits. The new construction that this bill will help facilitate will not only create new construction jobs during renovations, but will also allow the Ski Area to expand and improve its operations, creating more sustainable and permanent jobs. Additionally, the land MMSA will be transferring to the Forest Service includes high resource value lands that have long been desired for protection by local environmentalists and the Forest Service. This includes lands within the view shed of the Mono BasinNational Scenic Area, the first designated National Scenic Area and a place of incredible natural beauty.  This legislation has bipartisan support. The bill was first introduced by Rep. Buck McKeon in June 2011 and passed the House in April 2012 by a vote of 376--2. It was reintroduced by Rep. Paul Cook earlier this year with the support of both Democratic and Republican cosponsors and passed the House a second time on December 3, 2013.  Local government and community organizations also support this legislation, including the Mono County Board of Supervisors, the Mammoth Lakes Town Council, the Mammoth Lakes Chamber of Commerce, Mammoth Lakes Tourism, the Mono Lake Committee, and the Eastern Sierra Land Trust.  This trade has long been supported by noted environmentalists, including the late Andrea Mead Lawrence, after whom Congress earlier this year named a mountain in the nearby Sierra Nevada.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Enactment of this bill will ensure the long term success of one of the Nation's top ski resorts and benefit the local and regional economy, while allowing the Forest Service to acquire high resource value lands that will be enjoyed by Americans for generations to come.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1888       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
