 Last night, I used my very own hemp pen to sign the conference report, clearing the way for the House and Senate to pass legislation and send it to the President's desk. I am proud that the bill includes my provision to legalize the production of industrial hemp. It is a victory for farmers and consumers throughout our country.  Fighting for Kentucky hemp has been a long struggle. My State was once the national leader in the growing and production of industrial hemp, but then, for decades, a Federal ban halted that progress and shut American farmers out of the hemp field. Don't get me wrong--Hemp could still be found all over our country in all kinds of products. The problem is that it is all being grown somewhere else and imported into America. It is time to let American growers get back in business with this versatile crop once again.  The farmers, processors, and manufacturers in my State and across the country are ready for the hemp comeback. It began in 2014 when I secured the establishment of a hemp pilot program with the help of then-agricultural commissioner Jamie Comer. States like Kentucky got the chance to explore the plant's potential and show us just what hemp could do, and the results have been nothing short of extraordinary. Now, American-grown hemp can be found in your food, your clothes, and even in your car dashboard. The results mean jobs, economic growth, and new opportunity. Last year alone, hemp products contributed more than $16 million to Kentucky's economy, and that was just from the pilot program--just from the pilot program.  At a time when farm income is down and our growers are struggling, industrial hemp is a bright spot of agriculture's future.  My provision in the farm bill will not only legalize domestic hemp, but it will also allow State departments of agriculture to be responsible for its oversight. In Kentucky, that means that Commissioner Ryan Quarles--another champion of hemp--will be able to help farmers thrive. And I know the occupant of the Chair is familiar with Commissioner Quarles.  When the Senate votes on this legislation in the coming days, we will also be voting to give farmers throughout the country the chance to tap into hemp's potential and take part in its future. I have been proud to work with my colleagues in Congress, such as Senator Ron Wyden, and with hemp advocates in Kentucky to get to this point. Obviously, I will be proudly voting for this bill.                          ____________________
