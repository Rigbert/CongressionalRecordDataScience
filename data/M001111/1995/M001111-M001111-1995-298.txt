  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                          Pacific Coast Federation                                  of Fishermen's Associations,                                                   March 13, 1995.     Re fishing industry groups oppose ``sufficient language'' and          mandated timber harvests.     Members of Congress,     Capitol Hill,     Washington, DC.       Dear Member of Congress: The Pacific Coast Federation of      Fishermen's Associations (PCFFA) is the largest organization      of commercial fishermen on the west coast, with member      organizations from San Diego to Alaska. We represent working      men and women of the Pacific fishing fleet who generate tens      of thousands of jobs and are the economic mainstay of many      coastal communities throughout the Pacific coast region. We      are joined in this letter by the Northwest Sportfishing      Industry Association (NSIA), which represents the many      sportfishing businesses in the Northwest. There are more than      5,000 such businesses in this region, with several thousand      more in Alaska. Between our two organizations we represent      several billion dollars annually in economic productivity,      and more than 100,000 jobs along the Pacific coast as well as      far inland.       We oppose the current Congressional effort to approve      ``sufficiency language'' or to mandate minimum timber harvest      levels in the Northwest. However well meaning, these are      nevertheless bad ideas. Sufficiency language would simply      override all current protections for salmon and other aquatic      species. Mandatory timber harvest levels would essentially do      the same, since many levels could not be reached without      severe damage to other resources. The result would only be      additional degradation of already severely damaged salmon      spawning habitat, more economic dislocation within fishing      communities, and more lost jobs in our industry. Salmon      throughout the region have already been severely depressed      because of past timber harvests done without regard to their      environmental consequences. This region cannot afford to go      down that road once again.       We also are a natural resource dependent industry. We are      sympathetic to the plight of timber communities, and are not      opposed to harvesting timber through the existing Forest Plan      or in ways that are legal under current law. However, it      makes no economic sense to harvest timber on the backs of      fishermen and at the expense of the jobs and coastal      communities which salmon support. This would be a form of      economic suicide for the region.       Federal management agencies already have an aggressive fire      salvage program, and all the legal authority they need to      implement it. However, they should not be forced by law to      move faster than they can complete the necessary      environmental assessments and watershed analyses so they can      take the proper steps to protect fragile salmon and other      aquatic resources. The solution is not ``sufficiency      language,'' nor is it mandated levels. The real solution      would be to accelerate funding to the USFS and BLM to enable      them to more quickly complete the necessary watershed      analyses for their own planned salvage and harvest programs.       Sufficiency language and mandated harvest levels are simply      bad ideas. If enacted, they would further deplete salmon and      other aquatic resources which it is vitally important to      protect. They would also further devastate fishing economies      throughout the region. They would throw our industry further      into economic chaos. They would make it just that much      tougher, and just that much more expensive, to restore the      Northwest's valuable salmon runs back to full productivity.       We urge you to oppose every attempt to impose ``sufficiency      language'' to override current environmental protections as      well as the setting of mandatory harvest or salvage levels on      our nation's forests--whether by appropriations rider,      amendment or separate legislation. Thank you.           Sincerely,     Zeke Grader,       Executive Director,         Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations.     Liz Hamilton,       Executive Director,         Northwest Sportfishing Industry Association (NSIA).
