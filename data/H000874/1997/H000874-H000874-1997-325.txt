Speaker, I rise to pay tribute today to the life and legacy of one of Charles County's finest individuals, Mr. Leo K. Farrell, III who recently passed away on Feb. 13, 1997 after a bout with cancer.  Mr. Speaker, there are multiple ways to recognize the impact of an individual. Society often dictates one's worth by professional accomplishments, personal credentials, and how much wealth one has accumulated. Although, these are often the gauges by which we sometimes measure one another, these standards are often ephemeral compared to the commitment of family and community, and the regard peers cast on an individual. It has been noted that the true measure of an individual's success is in the number of people he or she calls ``friend.'' In either category, L.K. Farrall was a success.  In 1979, Mr. Farrall opened the doors of the very first L.K. Farrall Realtors, Ltd. To date, his efforts and energy matured to four additional offices in the southern Maryland region, employing over 175 people. Mr. Farrall labored to build his company not only through the avenues of sales but its service to the surrounding communities. According to his close friend Delegate Van Mitchell, Mr. Farrall had a saying ``You can get everything in life you want . . . if you help enough people get what they want.'' His selfless emphasis on others and his love for his family and community are remembered in testimonials from friends and colleagues which appear in a tribute in the April newsletter for the Charles County Chamber of Commerce.  Mr. Farrall served as a member of the Charles County Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors; he was the former chairman of the Charles County Economic Development Commission, a member of the Naval Industrial Alliance, and a generous contributor to Special Olympics, Habitat for Humanity, and to the American Cancer Society.  Mr. Speaker, it was through his giving that he gained, and through his example and his leadership that others learned to love and respect him. Charles County Commissioner William Daniel Mayer noted: ``as a friend you knew L.K. would always be there for you. he was unassuming. He shunned the limelight and took as much joy in your success as if it was his own. It is a privilege to have grown up with, to have worked with, and to have shared L.K. His wry wit, unflinching loyalty, love of family and a sincere dedication to his community will be missed. We must all be grateful that we had, even for a short time, L.K.''  Mr. Farrall is survived by his wife, Judy and two beautiful daughters. Although, Mr. Farrall passed away at the very young age of 51, his life and legacy will continue to serve as an example to others in southern Maryland because of his leadership and compassion for others.  I ask the Speaker and all my colleagues to join me in saluting the life of Mr. Leo K. Farrall, III and extend with me condolences to the Farrall family and the employees of his company.                          ____________________
