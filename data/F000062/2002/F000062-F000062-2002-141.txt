 President, I rise today to express my support for the Andean Trade Preference Expansion Act and the cloture vote on the motion to proceed.  However, I believe the Senate should move forward on this important piece of legislation separately from consideration of Trade Promotion Authority.  I believe it is essential for the people of Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia and the people of the United States that the Senate expeditiously debate and act on the Andean Trade Preference Expansion Act on its own.  The original Andean Trade Preference Act was designed to discourage illicit drug production and help participating countries develop a broader export base.  The results over the past decade have been very encouraging. The Andean Trade Preference Act has generated $3.2 billion in new output and $1.7 billion in new exports to the United States. Export diversification has resulted in the creation of 140,000 jobs in the region.  The excellent cooperation of participating countries with the United States in the fight against narcotics production and trafficking has resulted in significant gains. For example, coca cultivation in Bolivia has fallen by 68 percent and in Peru by 74 percent.  Unfortunately, we have not seen similar progress in Colombia, but this is due more to political instability and the continuing struggle against narco-terrorism. I am hopeful that these difficult issues can be resolved and that Colombia will enjoy the full benefits of this bill.  Just as important, the Andean Trade Preference Act has given hope to the people of the region for a better tomorrow and has shown them that the journey from poverty to economic prosperity need not begin with the cultivation of illicit narcotics.  Nevertheless, despite these success stories, the Andean Trade Preference Act expired on December 4, 2001 and the 90-day suspension of import duties on eligible products issued by President Bush is set to expire on May 16.  The House passed its own version of the Andean Trade Preference Expansion Act on November 16, 2001. That bill has now come to the Senate floor and will be amended to include Trade Promotion Authority legislation. I am concerned that this will slow passage of the underlying bill.  If the United States continues to delay passage of the Andean Trade Preference Expansion Act, the participating countries will be put in a vulnerable position and could face devastating consequences. They will deal with increased narcotics production and trafficking, and the gains of the past ten years will be lost.  In addition, in a recent meeting, the ambassadors of Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru indicated to me that inaction on this bill would result in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs. The hopes of hard working families will be shattered.  Finally, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Colombia all face presidential elections this year, and the lack of closer trade ties with the United States could impede continued growth of democracy in the region.  The resulting weakness of the central governments will only serve to reenforce the strength of drug lords and their armies and destabilize the region even further.  We should also be concerned about our own economy and export growth. Between 1991 and 1999, U.S. exports to the Andean region increased by 65 percent. The United States is the largest source of imports for each of the participating countries.  The gains from an expanded Andean Trade Act, strengthened democracies and stronger, more vibrant economies, will encourage even more U.S. investment and exports to the region, creating more jobs at home and fostering greater economic growth.  My home State of California, the fifth largest economic engine in the world and a leader in global commerce, will greatly benefit from increased prosperity and political stability in the Andean region.  If we do not act, U.S. credibility and leadership in the region will suffer and future efforts to expand trade in Central and South America will be met with skepticism and resistance.                             Cloture Motion
