Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to my friend and colleague, Charles Canady of Florida. I have had the good fortune to serve with Charles Canady on the Committee on the Judiciary. In his capacity as Chairman of the Constitution subcommittee, as in all his professional roles, he had served with honesty, dedication, and integrity. Therefore, I know I echo the sentiments of our colleagues, both on the Judiciary Committee and throughout the House, when I say that we will miss our friend, Charles Canady.  Charles Canady has served as a tireless advocate for the people of Florida's 12th Congressional District. At the same time, he has fought on behalf of all Americans to bring morality and common-sense to the laws governing our great nation. Even when issues as controversial as partial birth abortion came up, he stuck by his principles. When the country was divided during the impeachment nearly two years ago, he stood firmly behind the rule of law.  One of Charles Canady's guiding principles is that government should not divide its citizens, but unite them. It should not placeAmericans into separate racial, gender, or ethnic groups. Rather government should strengthen those bonds that make us all Americans. Throughout his tenure in the House, Charles Canady has remained committed to working toward realizing this goal.  For these and many other reasons, both Charles Canady's constituents and his colleagues will miss him. Back in 1992, Charles Canady pledged to serve no more than four consecutive terms in this body. While I admire his commitment to keeping his word, I know I speak for many of our colleagues when I say the House is losing one of its most effective Members. I wish Charles Canady the best in whatever the future holds.                          ____________________
