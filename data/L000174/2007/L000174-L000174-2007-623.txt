President, I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, the most senior person here and, of course, the one who serves the closest with Senator Cochran on the Appropriations Committee. I could not help but think, listening to the wonderful things my distinguished other friend from Mississippi, Senator Lott, was saying about Senator Thad Cochran, about a recent trip overseas we took together, and I heard him saying many of those same things out of the hearing of Senator Cochran, praising Senator Cochran very much on that trip with myself and other Senators. I mention that because sometimes praising you outside your presence means more than doing it inside your presence.  Thad Cochran is as close a friend as I have ever had in the Senate. We have traveled together overseas. I have traveled to Mississippi with him. He explained to me I had to slow down my speech a little bit. He has come to Vermont with me. My late parents used to tell me what a nice young man he is. I know how much my mother and father enjoyed meeting him not only in Vermont but in subsequent visits to Washington.  I recall what Senator Stennis once said of Senator Cochran: He is a Senator, all in capital letters. You could hear John Stennis's voice boom over here: He is a Senator's Senator. He is a Senator. Most importantly to me, he is my good friend.  I yield the floor.
