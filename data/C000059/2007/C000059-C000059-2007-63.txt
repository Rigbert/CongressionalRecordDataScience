 Rollcall #34, ``yea''--Motion to Adjourn, rollcall #35, ``no''--Ordering the Previous Question, and rollcall #36, ``no''--Agreeing to H. Res. 66.  H. Res. 66 is a closed rule that prohibits any amendments to the bill from being considered by the House. Madam Speaker, on November 14, 2006 you wrote in a Christian Science Monitor op-ed that ``Democrats pledge to make this the most honest, ethical, and open Congress in history.'' I am deeply disappointed that past pledges for an open Congress have been broken so quickly with H. Res. 66 and other closed rules imposed by the majority. I believe the People's House operates best when legislation moves through regular order and uses our Committee process where members from both sides of the aisle have an opportunity to work together to improve legislation. Under the new ``Closed-door Congress,'' the House has yet to consider a bill that was moved through regular order and considered by the Committee of jurisdiction. H. Res. 66 establishes the rules for considering H.R. 6, and, as a senior member of the Natural Resources Committee, I have significantconcerns about some of the provisions in H.R. 6. In particular, there are provisions addressing the 1998-99 Clinton Administration OCS leases that are ambiguous and may result in levies on all oil and natural gas lease holders in the Gulf of Mexico, not just the 1998-99 leaseholders. This and other poorly written provisions in H.R. 6 could have been corrected had the legislation been considered by the Natural Resources Committee or had the majority allowed amendments to be considered on the House floor. Unfortunately, the majority's ``Closed-door Congress'' chose to break its pledge of an ``open Congress'' and prevented these opportunities to improve the legislation.  Rollcall #37, ``no''--On Consideration of H.R. 6, rollcall #38, ``yes''--Motion to Recommit H.R. 6, rollcall #39, ``no''--Motion to Table the Appeal of the Ruling of the Chair, rollcall #40, ``no''--Final Passage of H.R. 6.  H.R. 6 represents the first vote for a tax increase in more than 13 years. I have repeatedly pledged to oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and businesses--and I stand by my pledge. The majority has claimed that passage of H.R. 6 will roll-back subsidies to the oil and natural gas industry that Congress passed in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. However, a Congressional Research Service report released in December of 2006 concluded that, on balance, the bill imposes ``a net tax increase on the industry of nearly $300 million over 11 years.'' Further raising taxes on the oil and natural gas industry will do nothing to help lower the price of gasoline at the pump Americans are paying and, ultimately, increases our country's dependence on foreign sources of oil. Madam Speaker, I am truly stricken by the fact that the new majority has chosen to bring a bill to the House floor during its highly touted first ``100 Hours'' that will benefit and strengthen the hands of the likes of Hugo Chavez. I oppose H.R. 6 because it will result in job losses, increase the price of gasoline at the pump, increase the cost of heating homes, and increase dependence on foreign sources of oil. I support an energy policy that takes steps to truly reduce America's dependence on foreign sources of oil while our Nation continues to invest and improve the development of renewable sources of energy and energy efficiency.
