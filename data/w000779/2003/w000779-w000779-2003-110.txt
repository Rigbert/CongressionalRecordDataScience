President, I want to take a moment to highlight a particular issue that my staff has been talking to the Small Business Administration, SBA about. This relates to an Oregon company named SkyTaxi, which has an innovative and ambitious business plan for providing on-demand air service to small communities. As my colleague from Maine knows better than most, small and rural communities are often gravely underserved by commercial airlines. These are places where transportation links are a make-or-break issue for local economic opportunity. But, as a recent General Accounting Office report concluded last January, the trend is not positive. The current turmoil in the airline industry hits small communities hard, because those are the first places airlines trim or eliminate service when they are looking to cut costs. And most efforts to promote air service to small communities have met with limited long-term success.
