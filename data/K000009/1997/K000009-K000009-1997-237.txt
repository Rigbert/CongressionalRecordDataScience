Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time, and I also thank the gentleman from New York [Mr. Gilman], the chairman of the committee.  I rise in support of the committee resolution and do not wish to question whether or not this is the perfect vehicle. It is the only vehicle that we have. And though the certification-decertification process may not please any one of us completely, at least it provides us with a way of ending the denial by both Governments, the United States and Mexico, of what is going on with our respective countries.  In fact, I think we should hold a session of Congress at the border. As a member of the Committee on Agriculture, I have traveled along that border and have had our own border agents tell us, ``Well, Congresswoman, you know if you really want to move drugs, you don't do it through this checkpoint. You just drive an over-the-road vehicle a mile away where there aren't any inspectors. And, by the way, hear that airplane up there? We know where that's headed.''  Our own Government knows that the border is a sieve. We know of the corruption throughout Mexico related to the drug trade. And today this is the only vehicle that we have to express our displeasure at this administration's actions and prior administrations' actions that continue denial.  I ask myself, why the denial, what are we afraid of as a country? We know we only inspect maybe 1 of every 100 to 200 trucks and vehicles that now come over the border. We have a $40 billion trade deficit over the last 2 years with Mexico and it is growing. We cannot possibly inspect all of the vehicles that come over that border, and the drug traders know it.
