President, a unanimous consent has been agreed to by both sides for the Senate to immediately proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations on today's Executive Calendar: PN 421, LTG Michael V. Hayden, to be General, reported by the Armed Services Committee today; and No. 70, which is the confirmation of General Hayden to be the Deputy Director of National Intelligence.  I further ask unanimous consent the nominations be confirmed en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then return to legislative session.
