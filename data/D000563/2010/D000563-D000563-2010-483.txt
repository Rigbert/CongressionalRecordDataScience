 We had an opportunity to pass flood insurance last week, and not a single Senator from Senator Vitter's side of the aisle would vote for the package because it provided unemployment compensation for 1.2 million Americans who are out of work, including 10,000 in the State of Louisiana. I believe for that reason the Republicans voted against it. They did not want to extend unemployment benefits. Flood insurance was in there, and they wouldn't vote for it. So after I object, I will offer a unanimous-consent request, and the Senator from Louisiana will get a chance to pass flood insurance as part of the entire package. So I object to this unanimous-consent request.
