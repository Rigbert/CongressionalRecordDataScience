 Madam President, I will make one final point. This proposal will not only help our States balance their budgets without slashing essential social services such as the Medicaid Program, but it will also provide much-needed help to struggling health care providers such as our rural hospitals, our nursing homes, and our home health agencies. Those health care providers have been struggling with inadequate reimbursements under Medicaid and Medicare. By increasing the Federal share of what is a partnership between the Federal Government and the States to provide health care for our low-income families, we will also be helping to stabilize the health care providers, particularly in rural States such as Nebraska and Maine. So that is another reason you will find that health care providers associations are strongly backing our legislation, as is the National Governors Association.  This is not a partisan issue; it is one where we have come together to provide much-needed relief to our partners, the States. My hope is that we will expeditiously enact our proposal before the July 4 recess.
