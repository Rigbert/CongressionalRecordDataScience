President, I would like to join my colleagues from the Northeast in support of Senator D'Amato's amendment providing assistance to dairy farmers devastated by an ice storm earlier this year. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment which will provide much needed assistance to dairy farmers in Vermont and throughout the Northeast.  This storm which hit the Northeast on January 9 left dairy farmers in Vermont, New York, New Hampshire and Maine without power for days at a time. I was happy to see that the disaster bill proposed by the administration and passed by the Appropriations Committee includes $4 million to reimburse dairy farmers for production losses suffered during the storm for milk that farmers were forced to dump.  Unfortunately the bill did not consider the long term losses that will be suffered by farmers until milk production returns to pre-storm levels. Now cows don't know whether the power is on or off, they still need to be milked twice a day every day. In addition to the costs incurred by the dumped milk, many cows suffered mastitis as a result of the delayed milking or were thrown off in their milking cycle to the extent that their milk production levels were significantly affected. In Vermont, it is estimated that the cost of long-term production losses will be $186,300. The total damages throughout the region will be much higher. For small dairy farms, this is just one more cost they can not afford to shoulder.  I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.
