President, today marks the 222nd anniversary of the signing of the Constitution by the States that assembled in Philadelphia. The constitutional design of our three branches of Government has provided for collaboration in protecting this fundamental balance. Earlier this week, when I addressed the Chief Justice and the Judicial Conference of the United States, I noted the anniversary of the signing of our Constitution. This anniversary deserves more attention than it has received, and I was heartened to see that one of Vermont's great newspapers, The Caledonian-Record, also saw fit to note this anniversary in a recent editorial. The Caledonian-Record noted, ``Our Constitution is timeless and the most relevant guide to continuing our freedoms. Millions of Americans have died in its defense. Celebrate it!''  As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee I am constantly reminded of the Constitution's continued importance and relevance to our daily lives. From the first amendment, which protects newspapers like The Caledonian-Record, to the rights of Americans to vote, the Constitution is the cornerstone of our democracy. We all mustremember how fortunate we are to enjoythe rights our Founders embedded in our guiding document.  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From The Caledonian-Record, Sept. 14, 2009]             It's Constitution Week: Celebrate Our Freedoms       Every year, America's newspapers celebrate the United      States Constitution by focusing on the document, with      features and editorials that acknowledge the central place in      America's freedoms that the Constitution possesses. We do it      to assure that Americans, in the rush of making a living, of      raising children, of growing up or growing old, and of all of      the other distractions of our lives, do not forget the vision      and the wisdom that almost miraculously guided our Founding      Fathers in composing this document. It is as important today,      indeed, probably more important, than it was in 18th century      America.       This is Constitution Week. It is fitting that it should      immediately follow the national commemoration of the worst,      most deadly domestic terrorism attack in our history, Sept.      11, 2001. That attack, literally brought home that nowhere in      the world are freedom loving people safe from the militant      insanity of ideologically driven terrorists, in this case of      radical Islamists. In previous epochal events, they were      Nazis, Japanese imperialists, Marxists, and others. In every      case, the adjuration that arose from 9/11 applies, and never      more strongly than in reverence of the Constitution, ``Never      forget!''       For the last 200-plus years, there have been, and are now,      those who would like to change our Constitution in ways that      occupy the whole continuum, from updating its grammar to      totally destroying it in the name of social action and the      progressive insistence that only the evolution of the present      to the future is relevant, that a document so old is a      totally irrelevant relic.       Not so! Our Constitution is timeless and the most relevant      guide to continuing our freedoms. Millions of Americans have      died in its defense. Celebrate it!                          ____________________
