Speaker, I rise today, on behalf of the California Delegation, to honor and pay tribute to the USS California (SSN-781), a Virginia-class submarine and the first submarine to be named after the Golden State. On the occasion of the submarine's commissioning, we could not be more proud to have one of the world's most modern and sophisticated nuclear-powered attack submarines named for the state of California.  The contract to build her was awarded to Northrop Grumman Newport News (now Huntington Ingalls Industries Newport News Shipbuilding) in Newport News, Virginia, on August 14, 2003. Construction began in December 2006. California's keel was laid down on May 1, 2009. She was christened on November 6, 2010, sponsored by Donna Willard, wife of Admiral Robert F. Willard. The California was launched eight days later, on November 14, 2010. The commissioning has been scheduled for October 29, 2011 by the Secretary of the Navy. USS California will be homeported at Groton, Connecticut.  Designed to meet the Navy's requirements in a post-Cold War era, Virginia-class submarines use advanced technologies to increase firepower, maneuverability and stealth. Along with other Virginia-class submarines, the California is tailored to excel in a wide range of warfighting missions with several innovations that significantly enhance its warfighting capabilities, especially in the littoral environment. The ship has a fly-by-wire ship control system that provides improved shallow-water ship handling. The class has special features to support special operation forces and prolonged deployments. Advanced technology is employed to provide the ship's company enhanced situational awareness and is designed to remain state of the practice for its entire operational life through rapid introduction of new systems and payloads.  Previous ships bearing the USS California name have a long and storied history. The first USS California, a screw propelled frigate, was christened in 1869. In 1941, the USS California (BB-44) was the flagship of the U.S. Pacific fleet stationed in Pearl Harbor. She was badly damaged by Japanese torpedoes, and partially sunk. The three crewmen serving aboard the battleship that day were posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for acts of bravery in saving the lives of their shipmates. A few months later, the California was salvaged and repaired, and served in the Pacific theater during the final two years of World War II. She was present at several crucial battles in the Pacific theater, including the Battle of Surigao Strait--the last naval engagement fought by opposing battleships.  The most recent USS California (CGN-26) was the lead ship of her class of nuclear powered guided missile cruisers and was also a vital part of the U.S. fleet from her launch in 1971 to her retirement in 1999. She was known as the ``Golden Grizzly,'' in recognition of the grizzly bear on the California state flag. We are pleased that the USS California (SSN-781) will follow in the footsteps of previous ships that have served this great country so proudly.  California is a state with a long naval history and strong naval tradition. The entire California Delegation is proud to welcome the USS California as the eighth U.S. Navy ship named after our home state. We have no doubt that she, and her crew, will serve our country honorably.  The following are the names of the Members of the California Congressional Delegation in support of the USS California:  Mike Thompson, Wally Herger, Daniel Lungren, Tom McClintock, Doris Matsui, George Miller, John Garamendi, Jerry McNerney, Jackie Speier, Pete Stark, Anna Eshoo, Mike Honda, Zoe Lofgren, Sam Farr, Dennis Cardoza, Jeff Denham, Jim Costa, Devin Nunes, Kevin McCarthy, Lois Capps, Elton Gallegly, Howard ``Buck'' McKeon, David Dreier, Brad Sherman, Howard Berman, Adam Schiff, Henry Waxman, Xavier Becerra, Judy Chu, Karen Bass, Lucille Roybal-Allard, Maxine Waters, Janice Hahn, Laura Richardson, Grace Napolitano, Linda Sanchez, Edward Royce, Jerry Lewis, Gary Miller, Joe Baca, Ken Calvert, Mary Bono Mack, Dana Rohrabacher, Loretta Sanchez, John Campbell, Darrell Issa, Brian Bilbray, Bob Filner, Duncan Hunter, and Susan Davis.                          ____________________
