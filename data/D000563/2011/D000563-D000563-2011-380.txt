 Mr. McCAIN. So one would have to assume that the Senator from Illinois believes the last stimulus package was successful, which was, counting interest, over $1 trillion. The Senator from Illinois and others who advocated the stimulus package and the administration said: If we pass this, unemployment will be a maximum of 8 percent. This will stimulate our economy and create jobs.  Do you know what the Senator from Illinois and others are saying now? It was not enough, that it was not enough, that we didn't spend enough, that we didn't make the deficit larger. Because certainly nothing in the stimulus package was paid for. So I hope the Senator from Illinois understands--the American people understand--that just spending more money has failed and failed miserably.  When we look at the latest news, on the front page of the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post and the New York Times, that our economy is staggering back into a situation of stagnation, and the response--I will be glad to let the Senator respond. The answer on the other side is: Well, let's have some more spending and let's raise taxes. Let's take some more money out of the taxpayers' pockets in the form of spending more money--their money. It is not the administration's money. It is not the money of the Senator from Illinois. It is the people's money. Take some more money of theirs--and this is the Nobel Prize--well, I will not--anyway. Take more money and taxes and more out of the taxpayers' pockets, and that will be the answer to our problems.  I will be glad to hear the response of the Senator from Illinois.
