 But the language of the bill acknowledges what Republicans have been saying for months: The administration has no plan to safely close this secure detention facility.  Closing Guantanamo without a safe alternative would be irresponsible,dangerous, and unacceptable to the American people. Americans are worried that closing Guantanamo by an arbitrary deadline won't keep them as safe as Guantanamo has. They are particularly worried about the administration's reported plan to transfer some detainees to detention facilities right here on American soil. State and local officials in places such as Louisiana, California, Virginia, and Missouri have been introducing resolutions to keep terrorists from coming to their communities.  One look at the experience that Alexandria, right across the river here, had a few years ago during the trial of 9/11 conspirator Zacharias Moussaoui makes it easier to see why all these communities are so concerned. Moussaoui was just one terrorist. Yet the effect his presence had on the city of Alexandria was enough for the city's current mayor to state emphatically that he is absolutely opposed to relocating prisoners from Guantanamo to Alexandria. ``We had this experience,'' he said recently. ``Let someone else have it.''  According to press accounts, housing Moussaoui turned parts of Alexandria into a virtual encampment. Every time he was moved to the courthouse, he was transferred in a heavily armed convoy that shut down traffic and locked down the surrounding community.  One security expert recently told the Washington Post that housing detainees from Guantanamo would likely be even more complicated than it was for Moussaoui, with more locations for security personnel to cover and even more snipers.  According to the same Post article, one of Moussaoui's lawyers said that bringing just two or three Guantanamo detainees to Alexandria would be a ``major headache.'' Alexandria's sheriff has warned that multiple detainees could ``overwhelm the system.''  Based on the Moussaoui experience, local business owners in Alexandria also think the arrival of detainees from Guantanamo could be a serious drag on commerce. But even more worrisome for residents is the concern that housing detainees in Alexandria could invite terrorist attacks.  I ask unanimous consent to have the Washington Post article I am referring to entitled ``Security Worries in the Suburbs, Possible Move of Terrorist Suspects to Alexandria for Trial Raises Outcry'' printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 25, 2009]                    Security Worries in the Suburbs                           (By Jerry Markon)       An outcry is growing in Alexandria over a prospect no one      seems to like: terrorist suspects in the suburbs.       The historic, vibrant community less than 10 miles from the      White House markets itself as a ``federal friendly zone.''      But it has turned decidedly unfriendly to news that the Obama      administration might move some detainees from their highly      controlled military fortress at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to      Alexandria to stand trial at the federal courthouse.       ``We would be absolutely opposed to relocating Guantanamo      prisoners to Alexandria,'' Mayor William D. Euille (D) said.      ``We would do everything in our power to lobby the president,      the governor, the Congress and everyone else to stop it.      We've had this experience, and it was unpleasant. Let someone      else have it.''       The 2006 death penalty trial of Zacarias Moussaoui, who was      convicted of conspiring in the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11,      2001, turned the neighborhood into a virtual encampment, with      heavily armed agents, rooftop snipers, bomb-sniffing dogs,      blocked streets, identification checks and a fleet of      television satellite trucks.       President Obama has vowed to close Guantanamo by January,      and the government is reviewing files on the roughly 240      detainees. The administration has strongly indicated that      some will be transferred to federal courts, and a senior      Justice Department official recently named Alexandria, along      with Manhattan, as possible destinations.       Alexandria Sheriff Dana A. Lawhorne, who operates the city      jail, said federal security requirements for housing suspects      could ``overwhelm the system'' if multiple detainees are      brought there.       City officials and some legislators are concerned that      terror trials would take years, shut down roads and cost      millions and could invite attacks from terrorist      sympathizers. Business owners in the dense area around the      courthouse--newly filled with hotels, restaurants and luxury      apartments--fear disruptions amid a declining economy.       Local officials acknowledged that they cannot control the      docket at the federal courthouse and said they would work      with the Justice Department to minimize problems. But the      resistance in Alexandria, one of the few places known for      handling high-level terrorism and national security cases,      illustrates some of the practical complexities facing the      president's plan to shutter the controversial detention      facility.       The Guantanamo detainees include the five accused planners      of Sept. 11, among them former al-Qaeda operations chief      Khalid Sheik Mohammed. Putting detainees on trial in      Alexandria would mean moving them from an isolated island      prison 90 miles from Florida to a neighborhood brimming with      residents, thousands of federal employees and the new Westin      Alexandria Hotel 190 feet from the courthouse door.       ``It would be a disaster,'' said Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-     Va.), who co-sponsored legislation to ban the use of federal      funds to transfer detainees to Virginia detention facilities,      one of at least 10 similar bills filed by Republicans      nationwide. In a March 13 letter to Attorney General Eric H.      Holder Jr., Wolf questioned how officials would protect the      community.       Dean Boyd, a Justice Department spokesman, said the      administration is reviewing how to handle Guantanamo      detainees. ``It's far too early to speculate on the final      disposition of any particular detainee at this time, much      less begin speculating about potential judicial districts for      prosecution,'' he said. He declined to comment on Wolf s      letter.       Matt Branigan, president of Fairfax-based Watermark Risk      Management International, said that the security could cost      millions and that a courthouse in a less-populated area would      be safer than Alexandria.       ``The concern is that someone from the terrorist side of      things would want to make some statement in conjunction with      the trials,'' said Branigan, a former senior Air Force anti-     terrorism officer. He said the new development in the area      ``makes the security plan much more complicated. You have      more locations to cover, more roofs to lock down with      snipers.''       When the Alexandria jail, an eight-story red-brick building      adjacent to the Capital Beltway near the Woodrow Wilson      Bridge, opened in 1987, the area had been a city dump.       ``The idea wasn't that you were going to house      terrorists,'' Lawhorne said. ``It was a local jail.''       The 10-story federal courthouse opened a few blocks away in      1996 in what had been a field of mud. The chief judge brought      bag lunches to work because there were so few restaurants      nearby.       Major terror trials were held in Manhattan in those days,      but Alexandria became the Bush administration's courthouse of      choice after hijacked airplanes slammed into the World Trade      Center and the Pentagon. Northern Virginia jurors and judges      were considered more conservative, and officials thought the      area was more secure.       By early 2002, about a dozen terrorist suspects were held      at the jail, which by contract accepts up to 150 federal      inmates, and more if it can. Moussaoui, who spent 23 hours a      day inside his 80-square-foot cell, was constantly monitored      and never saw other inmates. An entire unit of six cells and      a common area was set aside just for him.       ``It was a real hassle,'' said Alan Yamamoto, one of his      lawyers. ``Bringing even two or three or four people over      there is going to be a major headache.''       Lawhorne said he would discuss any requests to hold      Guantanamo inmates with city officials.       ``It would be a very extremely high-risk situation for us.      . . . My first obligation is to protect the interests of the      city,'' said the sheriff, who added that he would do what he      can: ``You can't run the other way when your country calls.''       The 450-inmate jail was locked down every time Moussaoui      was moved to the back of the nearby courthouse in a heavily      armed convoy. Traffic was stopped as snipers watched from      rooftops. The route from the jail is much denser today.       On a single block behind the courthouse, there is a luxury      326-unit apartment complex with a Fed Ex/Kinko's, cleaners      and cafe on the first floor; an office building with room for      ground floor retail; another office building; and a Marriott      Residence Inn. All opened within the past 18 months.       Pramod Raheja, owner of Intelligent Office on the ground      floor of one building, said he would ``strongly oppose''      bringing Guantanamo detainees to the neighborhood.       Directly in front of the courthouse, in a thriving      community near Old Town known as Carlyle, the Westin anchors      a virtually all-new block with a coffee bar, an upscale      restaurant, a condominium complex with units costing more      than $1 million and a Thai restaurant. A Starbucks is opening      this month. The new U.S. Patent and Trademark Office complex,      with more than 7,000 employees, starts on the next block.       ``I've never agreed with people who say `not in my back      yard,' but there are just too many people around here,'' said      Jim Boulton, president of the unit owners association at the      Caryle Towers condominium complex, which has been trying to      get the government to remove security barriers left over from      the Moussaoui trial. ``They need to find someplace else.''  Mr. McCONNELL. The problems that one terrorist caused for Alexandria could be duplicated in any city or town to which detainees from Guantanamoare sent. Although the administration hasn't given us any details on which cities or towns they might choose, we can imagine what they could look forward to, based on Alexandria's experience with Moussaoui. So here is what a community would have to experience: heavily armed agents patrolling local neighborhoods, rooftop snipers, streets locked down and access to local businesses cut off, identification checks and bomb-smelling dogs checking cars, millions of dollars in cost and strained local resources. That is what you get when you have a terrorist in your hometown. Kentuckians don't want to live under these conditions. I doubt any other American would either, especially if we consider that any community that becomes a home to these detainees could have to endure these conditions for literally years, given the possible length of terror trials.  Some of the other locations that have been mentioned as possible destinations for the terrorists at Guantanamo include facilities in South Carolina and Kansas. One local official in South Carolina responded to the possibility by saying he didn't have the police resources to deal with an influx of terrorists from Guantanamo. An official in Kansas said Guantanamo detainees would significantly tax his police resources.  The administration claims that closing Guantanamo and transferring some detainees to U.S. soil would make the American people safer. It is hard to understand that statement. But based on the experience of Alexandria, it is easy to see why many Americans are skeptical. The administration has said that when it comes to Guantanamo, its highest priority is the safety of the American people. But safety is our top concern. The administration should rethink its plan to transfer terrorists to American communities.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
