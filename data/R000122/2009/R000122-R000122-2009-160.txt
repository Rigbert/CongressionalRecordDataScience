President, I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, for his inclusion of an important provision regarding State eligibility for the FMAP increase in this bill. If it were not for this provision, my State of Rhode Island may not have been eligible for the relief because a State law effective on July 1, 2008 changed eligibility, but the change was not implemented until the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, approved a waiver on October 1, 2008. The timing of the State's decision, not the approval date by CMS, should be the controlling factor.  I ask the chairman, does section 5001(f)(1)(C)(ii) of the bill specifically address this situation?
