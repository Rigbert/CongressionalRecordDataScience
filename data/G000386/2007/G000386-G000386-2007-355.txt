 President, the Senate just voted on an amendment that makes a good first step to putting kids first in SCHIP. However, it is all well and good to say we are putting kids first. But the amendment we just voted on is not worth the paper it is printed on if the Senate does not take the next step and back up these words with policy.  The Cornyn amendment represents actual kids-first policy. I ask Senators to support the needed next step to putting kids first. Support the Cornyn amendment.                           Amendment No. 511
