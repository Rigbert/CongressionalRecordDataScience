 Mr. McCARTHY. The gentleman is correct. There are many times we have worked together, on sanctions, on homeland and others. We work very well together.  The gentleman knows I came to you about CHIP when the committee was directed, on your side of the aisle, not to do anything with the majority party, so I came to you because of our history.
