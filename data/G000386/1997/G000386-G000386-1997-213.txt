 President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator Breaux, to introduce the Medicare Beneficiary Information Act of 1997. Medicare is a Federal program paid for with taxpayer dollars. Therefore, Congress has the duty and obligation to ensure beneficiaries have access to necessary information to select an appropriate health plan for their individual health care needs.  This legislation is based upon many of the recommendations made to members of the Senate Special Committee on Aging at a hearing we held on April 10, 1997. This bill will improve competition among Medicare health plans and provide Medicare beneficiaries with the useful information they need to make an informed choice when selecting a health plan. Good, reliable information that allows consumers to select among competing options is essential for any market to work. The health care market is no exception. Under Medicare, accurate, widely-available comparative information does not exist. The Medicare Beneficiary Information Act of 1997 addresses this problem by including the following provisions:  While beneficiaries now have to call all the health plans in their area, wait for the marketing materials to come, and then try and compare all the different brochures with no standard terminology required, this bill instructs the Secretary to develop comparison charts for each Medicare HMO market and for Medicare Select plans. The Secretary has discretion to utilize existing mechanisms in place, such as regional Health Care Financing Administration [HCFA] offices and Insurance Counseling Assistance [ICA's] programs, to develop and distribute these charts.  Comparison charts would be distributed by Medicare health plans in their marketing materials and at the time of enrollment and annually thereafter. In addition, the charts would be available upon request through HCFA. The charts would help beneficiaries understand the difference between the HMO's in their market. The charts would also contain a description of standard fee-for-service Medicare, so beneficiaries have a reference point.  The charts will tell beneficiaries about, for example, the health plans' additional benefits; additional premiums; out-of-pocket expenses; disenrollment rates, as recommended by the General Accounting Office at the Aging Committee hearing; appeal rates, reversed and denied; coverage for out-of-area services.  The bill also requires plans to inform beneficiaries about their rights and responsibilities using understandable, standard terminology regarding benefits; appeals and grievance procedures; restrictions on payments for services not provided by the plan; out-of-area coverage; coverage of emergency services and urgently needed care; coverage of out-of-network services; and any other rights the Secretary determines to be helpful to beneficiaries.  These provisions are also included in the bill I introduced on May 6, entitled the ``Medicare Patient Choice and Access Act of 1997,'' or S. 701. Senator Breaux and I believe that providing Medicare beneficiaries with proper information to select the health plan that best meets their individual health care needs is so important, we decided to introduce this free-standing bill. Increasing choices within the Medicare program has strong bipartisan support, but this approach is meaningless if beneficiaries cannot make an informed choice. Our bill can be enacted and implemented quickly. HCFA is already collecting this data and plans to startdistributing comparative information this summer through the Internet. However, Internet access is not enough. We need to provide this information in written form and through Medicare counseling programs as well. Medicare beneficiaries, as research has shown, prefer reviewing written materials and having someone with which to talk. Our bill would enable beneficiaries to obtain a user-friendly chart utilizing existing Medicare counseling programs, local Medicare offices and through health plans participating in the Medicare program.  We ask our colleagues on both side of the aisle to join us in cosponsoring this important legislation. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be submitted for the Record. I also ask unanimous consent that a news column by Senator Breaux be included in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the the Record, as follows:                                 S. 789       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

In order to assist in the dissemination of the      comparative reports, the Secretary may also utilize medicare      offices open to the general public, the beneficiary      assistance program established under section 4359 of the      Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 1395b-     3), and the health insurance information counseling and      assistance grants under section 4359 of that Act (42 U.S.C.      1395b-4).                                                                    ____       Giving Older Consumers Better Info on Health Care Benefits               (John Breaux, U.S. Senator for Louisiana)       The federal government needs to provide older Americans      with better information about all their health care options.      That was the conclusion of a senate hearing I recently      cochaired as the new ranking Democrat on the Senate Special      Aging Committee. We called in a number of health care experts      to talk about the quality of information provided to millions      of Medicare beneficiaries, including nearly 600,000 in      Louisiana.       Many who testified said that right now Medicare      beneficiaries are not being given all the information they      need to adequately compare the costs and benefits of their      health care coverage.       We learned that many beneficiaries simply do not know how      managed care is different from standard fee-for-service      Medicare. And they are not getting simple explanations of the      differences among the Medicare Health Maintenance      Organizations (HMO's) in their local areas. Because it is      generally agreed that HMO's best serve their enrollees when      they compete on factors other than just price, providing      Medicare beneficiaries with more and better information is      essential.       Consumers ideally need simple, readable comparison charts      so they are able to readily understand the differences      between plans. Currently, the Health Care Financing      Administration (HCFA), which administers Medicare, does not      provide beneficiaries with any comparative data. This means      older people who want to learn about managed care options      must call a toll-free number to see what HMO's are in their      area and then call each company one-by-one and request their      health care information. The problem is that each local plan      with a Medicare contract presents information using different      formats and language, so it's difficult or even impossible to      make cost and benefit comparisons.       And while the vast majority of Medicare beneficiaries--87      percent nationally--remain enrolled in traditional fee-for-     service Medicare, this is changing rapidly. The number of      beneficiaries nationwide who enroll in HMO's is growing by      about 30 percent a year. In Louisiana, the growth rate is      more than 50 percent. The number of health plans with      Medicare contracts is also increasing rapidly. In 1993, there      were 110 such plans. Last year, the number more than doubled      to 241.       In a recent report to the Congress, the General Accounting      Office (GAO) was critical of the type of information older      Americans get on their health care options. The Prospective      Payment Assessment Commission also said in a recent report      that ``cost and benefit definitions should be standardized so      that beneficiaries can better compare plans.''       And the Institute of Medicine last year reported that      ``current information available to Medicare beneficiaries      lags far behind the kinds of assistance provided by      progressive private employers to their employees.''       One way to begin addressing these disturbing structural      problems is to provide more and better information so that      beneficiaries can make informed choices. It is really a      fairly simple concept, but one that government often loses      sight of--people make wiser and less costly decisions for      themselves and their families if they have the right kind of      information.       In fact, in its October 1996 report, GAO recommended that      the federal government require plans to use standard formats      and terminology; produce benefit and cost comparison charts      with all Medicare options available for all areas; and      analyze, compare and widely distribute certain statistics      about HMO's, including their disenrollment rates and rate of      complaints.       Clearly, we must find a better way to inform Medicare      consumers about their choices because good information is the      key to making the right health care choices for ourselves and      our loved ones.                                 ______                                       By
