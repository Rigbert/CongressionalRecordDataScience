Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  H.R. 330 designates the memorial located at March Field Air Museum in Riverside, California, as the Distinguished Flying Cross National Memorial in honor of current and former members of the Armed Forces who have been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.  This national memorial will not be a unit of the National Park System, and the designation does not require or permit any expenditures of Federal funds.  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 330, which has passed the House as part of the most recent Department of Defense authorization bill, as well as a stand-alone bill in the 112th Congress by a vote of 392-1.  I reserve the balance of my time.
