 President, I rise in support of the Lautenbergamendment, because I believe it offer women a vital protection against those who might do them harm.  Every year, an estimated 2 million women are victimized by domestic violence.  Of these 2 million, nearly 6,000 die.  And 70 percent of the time, the perpetrators of the deadly violence use a gun.  Mr. President, we already prohibit convicted felons from possessing a firearm. But is an unfortunate fact that many domestic violence offenders are never convicted of a felony. Outdated or ineffective laws often treat domestic violence as a lesser offense.  Sometimes, victims are reluctant to cooperate for fear of more violence.  And sometimes victims just don't want to pull themselves through the ordeal of a trial.  And finally, plea bargains often result in misdemeanor convictions for what are really felony crimes.  As a result, Mr. President, many perpetrators of severe and recurring domestic violence are still permitted to posses a gun. Mr. President, these people are like ticking time bombs. It is only a matter of time before the violence get out of hand, and the gun results in tragedy.  Something must be done to close this dangerous loophole.  This amendment looks to the type of crime, rather than the classification of the conviction. Anyone convicted of a domestic violence offense would be prohibited from possessing a firearm. Fewer abusers will have guns, and fewer of the abused will wake up each morning wondering whether they will live through the day. I thank the Senator from New Jersey for his efforts, and I yield the floor.
