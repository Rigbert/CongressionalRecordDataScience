People are very upset about it. Many do not understand it. Sometimes it is humanitarian in nature.  We have seen these heart-rending pictures of people who are literally starving to death, mothers holding their children as they starve to death in their arms, and we sense as Americans a feeling of compassion and caring to come and provide our extra bounty so that they do not die literally in the dust covered with flies. That is what America has always been about, we have always stood for.  I will tell you an area of foreign aid the gentlewoman would agree with me on, and we really ought to take a look, and I am afraid we have not. That is military foreign aid. When it comes to sending our millions and often billions of dollars overseas to protect Germany and Japan, this Member has a real problem. Here we are, 50 years after World War II, and we are still defending Japan? For goodness sakes, these folks are cleaning our clock when it comes to the trade account. They ship all of their products here. They have a trade surplus with the United States, and we are sending millions of dollars [[Page H 6266]] overseas for troops and ships and planes to protect Japan?  The same thing is true in Europe. For goodness sakes, now, the Berlin Wall is down. The cold war is over, and we still defend Europe 50 years later, while the Germans are investing and uniting their country and educating their work force, making better products, a higher, I might say, standard of living, unfortunately, than the United States, in many areas. That is military foreign aid which we tried to address on this floor in the name of burdensharing, saying to our allies, ``It is about time you share this burden that we have carried for 50 years in this country.''  But many of our friends who are the first to say they hate foreign aid would not even consider touching this military foreign aid which costs us so dearly.
