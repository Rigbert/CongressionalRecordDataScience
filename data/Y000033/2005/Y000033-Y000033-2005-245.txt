Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.  The motion was agreed to.  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. McHugh) having assumed the chair, Mr. Hefley, Acting Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3) to authorize funds for Federal-aid highways, highway safety programs, and transit programs, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                          ____________________
