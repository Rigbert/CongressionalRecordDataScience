 What is inappropriate here is litigation in the wake of a response to the Government to protect American citizens. The Federal Government is not in the communications business, not in the telephone business. There will be no program without the companies. It isthe litigation itself that endangers the program, not just the amount of money that might be awarded. Having the taxpayers in effect pay the plaintiffs' lawyers is not the kind of solution that is going to continue the program.  This is an area that cries out for bipartisanship, and that is exactly what happened in the Senate. By an overwhelming vote of 68 to 29, a substantial--I guess every single one of the 29 were Democrats--a significant number of Democrats, more than half, voted for this bipartisan bill. We know for a fact there are 21 Democrats in the House who support what the Senate did. If you add those 21 Democrats to the Republicans in the House, we know there is a bipartisan majority in the House of Representatives to pass the very same bill we passed in the Senate.  I keep hoping we will somehow, through this process, evolve the same kind of spirit that we were able to exhibit on a bipartisan basis in passing the economic stimulus package earlier in the year and that we exhibited last week on the housing bill, which presumably will pass tomorrow or Wednesday. So I have not given up hope. But this is no small matter. This is about protecting the American people from attacks on our homeland.  We know we have successfully protected them for almost 6 years now, since 9/11. I don't think we ought to let our guard down and assume that our enemies have gone to sleep. This is an extremely important issue. I hope at some point we will figure some way forward that gets the job done, but I do not see it at the moment, and I do not think a short-term extension will help us get there.  I yield the floor.
