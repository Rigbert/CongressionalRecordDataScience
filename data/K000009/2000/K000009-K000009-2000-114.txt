Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for bringing this important economic project to our attention. The committee in our report identified this project as one that should be given special consideration by the Department, and I am certainly willing and prepared to work with the gentlewoman to be certain the Department is supportive of this very worthy project.                              {time}  1745
