 President, this week the Senate will consider more of the President's choices to fill important positions in the Federal Government. Too many important seats have continued to gather dust 2.5 years into this Presidency due to systematic Democratic obstruction.  The President deserves his team, and the American people deserve to be governed by the government they actually elected back in 2016. So as long as there continues to be resistance to processing uncontroversial nominees in the typical fashion by voice vote, we will just continue to vote on these impressive men and women.  Leading off this week are nominees to be Deputy Under Secretary of the Treasury, Ambassador to the Republic of Fiji, Solicitor of the Department of the Interior, and Deputy Commissioner of Social Security. I hope our colleagues will join in supporting each of them.                          ____________________
