President, I would like to express the common sentiment of the Senate, and that is the great respect and esteem we have for the people of the Northwest in their great trials in this historically unprecedented flooding, and particularly to indicate how hard and tirelessly their Senators are working to make sure the people of America respond to their needs--Senator Dorgan and Senator Conrad of North Dakota, Senator Daschle and Senator Johnson of South Dakota, Senator Wellstone and Senator Grams of Minnesota. So we are all admirers of the great courage of the people of the West.                          ____________________
