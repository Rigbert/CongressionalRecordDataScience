 Our legislation, the ``Reversing the Expatriation of Profits Offshore,'' REPO Act, will stem the rising tide of corporate inversions.  It's tax season. Citizens across America are filing their taxes this week. They're paying their taxes. A lot of taxes. But some corporate citizens are relaxing this tax season. They've moved their mailing address out of the country. They've set up a filing cabinet and a mail box overseas. This way, they escape from millions of dollars of Federal taxes.  These corporate expatriations aren't illegal. But they're sure immoral. During a war on terrorism, coming out of a recession, everyone ought to be pulling together. But instead, these companies are using recession and terrorism to get out of the United States. If companies don't have their hearts in America, they ought to get out.  Adding insult to injury, some of these companies have fat contracts with the government. So they'll take other people's tax dollars to make a profit, but they won't pay their share of taxes to keep America strong.  The bill Chairman Baucus and I are introducing today will place corporate inversions on the endangered species list. Our bill requires the IRS to look at where a company has its heart and soul, not where it has a filing cabinet and a mail box. If a company remains controlled in the United States, our bill requires the company to pay its fair share of taxes, plain and simple.  When I am firmly committed to halting corporate inversions, I also recognize that the rising tide of corporate expatriations demonstrates that our international tax rules are deeply flawed. In many cases, those flaws seriously undermine an American company's ability to compete in the global marketplace. This competitive disadvantage is often cited by companies that engage in inversion transactions.  I believe that we need to bring our international tax system in line with our open market trade policies, and wish to affirm for the record that reform of our international tax laws is necessary for our U.S. businesses to remain competitive in the global marketplace. Moreover, those U.S. companies that rejected doing a corporate inversion are left to struggle with the complexity and competitive impediments of our international tax rules. This is an unjust result for companies that chose to remain in the United States of America. I am committed to remedying this inequity.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a technical explanation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2119       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Reversing the Expatriation      of Profits Offshore Act''.     SEC. 2. TAX TREATMENT OF INVERTED CORPORATE ENTITIES.

(a) In General.--Section 845(a) of the Internal Revenue      Code of 1986 (relating to allocation in case of reinsurance      agreement involving tax avoidance or evasion) is amended by      striking ``source and character'' and inserting ``amount,      source, or character''.       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section      shall apply to any risk reinsured after April 11, 2002.                                  ____ Reversing the Expatriation of Profits Offshore, REPO, Act--Technical           Explanation of the Staff of the Committee on Finance       Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Chuck Grassley, R-     IA, and Chairman Max Baucus, D-MT, today are offering their      legislative response to the growing problem of corporate      inversions, the ``Reversing the Expatriation of Profits      Offshore'', REPO, Act. Following is a brief summary of the      REPO Act.       In general, this legislation would curtail the tax benefits      sought by U.S. companies undertaking inversion transactions.      The legislation would apply to two types of inversion      transactions, which would be subject to different regimes      under the proposal.       The first type would be a ``pure'' or nearly pure      inversion, in which: 1. a U.S. corporation becomes a      subsidiary of a foreign corporation or otherwise transfers      substantially all of its properties to a foreign corporation;      2. the former shareholders of the U.S. corporation end up      with 80 percent or more (by vote or value) of the stock of      the foreign corporation after the transaction; and 3. the      foreign corporation, including its subsidiaries, does not      have substantial business activities in its country of      incorporation. The legislation would deny the intended tax      benefits of this type of inversion by deeming the top-tier      foreign corporation to be a domestic corporation for all      purposes of the Internal Revenue Code. This proposal would be      effective as to inversion transactions occurring on or after      March 21, 2002.       For purposes of this proposal, corporations with no      significant operating assets, few or no permanent employees,      or no significant real property in the foreign country of      incorporation would not be treated as meeting the substantial      business activities test. In addition, companies would not be      considered to be conducting substantial business activities      in the country of incorporation by merely holding board      meetings in the foreign country or by relocating a limited      number of executives to the foreign jurisdiction.       The second type of inversion covered by the legislation      would be a transaction similar to the ``pure'' inversion      defined above, except that the 80 percent ownership threshold      is not met. In such a case, if a greater-than-50 percent but      less than 80 percent ownership threshold is met, then a      second set of rules would apply to these ``limited''      inversions.       Under these rules, the inversion transaction would be      respected, i.e., the foreign corporation would be respected      as foreign, but: 1. the corporate-level ``toll charge'' for      establishing the inverted structure would be strengthened,      and 2. restrictions would be placed on the company's ability      to reduce U.S. tax on U.S.-source income going forward. These      measures generally would apply for a 10-year period following      the inversion. This prong of the proposal would be effective      as to inversion transactions in this second category      occurring on or after March 21, 2002. It would also be      effective as to all structures arising from pure inversions      or limited inversions that are grandfathered under the      legislation, but it would be applied to those structures      prospectively.       Under the legislation, the corporate-level ``toll charge''      imposed under sections 304, 311(b), 367, 1001, 1248, or any      other provision of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to      the transfer of controlled foreign corporation stock or other      assets from a U.S. corporation to a foreign corporation would      be taxable, without offset by any other tax attributes, e.g.,      net operating losses or foreign tax credits. No similar      ``walling-off'' of toll charges would apply to shareholder-     level toll charges imposed under section 367(a).       In addition, no deductions or additions to basis or cost of      goods sold for transactions with foreign related parties      would be permitted unless the taxpayer concludes an annual      pre-filing agreement, advance pricing agreement, or other      agreement with the IRS, a ``preapproval agreement'', to      ensure that all related-party transactions comply with all      relevant provisions of the Code, including sections 482, 845,      163(j), and 267(a)(3). Similarly, the transfer or license of      intangible property from a U.S. corporation to a related      foreign corporation would be disregarded, and cost-sharing      arrangements would not be respected unless approved under      such an agreement.       The confidentiality and disclosure rules normally      applicable to advance pricing agreements would apply to all      preapproval agreements entered into pursuant to this      legislation, and the parameters for the IRS's statutorily      required annual APA report would be amended to require a      summary section for inversion transactions.       The second set of measures also includes modifications to      the ``earnings stripping'' rules of section 163(j) (which      deny or defer deductions for certain interest paid to foreign      related parties), as applied to inverted corporations. The      legislation would eliminate the debt-equity threshold      generally applicable under that provision and reduce the 50      percent threshold for ``excess interest expense'' to 25      percent.       The provisions of both prongs of this legislation also      would apply to certain partnership transactions similar to      corporate inversion transactions.       The legislation also strengthens the present-law rules of      section 845(a) in a manner intended to address reinsurance      transactions with foreign related parties that have the      effect of stripping out earnings of a U.S. corporation,      regardless of whether an inversion transaction has occurred.      The legislation modifies the present-law provision permitting      the Treasury Department to allocate or recharacterize items      of investment income, premiums, deductions, assets, reserves,      credits or other items, or to make other adjustments, under a      reinsurance agreement between related parties, if necessary      to reflect the proper source and character of income. The      legislation permits such an allocation, recharacterization or      adjustment if necessary to reflect the proper amount, source      or character of income. This provision would be effective for      any risk reinsured after April 11, 2002.
