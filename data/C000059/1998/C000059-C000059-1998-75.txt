Speaker, one of the things that makes America great is that in towns and cities across our nation there are citizens who are willing to step forward to dedicate their talent and energy to make life better for their friends and neighbors. The city of Perris, California has been fortunate to have many citizens who have given so freely of themselves in their dedication to the future of the youngest members of our district. Mr. John R. Harrison is one of these outstanding individuals.  Mr. Harrison has been an instrumental part of Perris Valley area business and youth programs for many years. After graduating from college, he became a partner in Dan's Feed & Seed, a business which supplies the Perris Valley and surrounding areas with animal feed, seed, veterinary supplies, hardware and plumbing items. He has since become a 100% shareholder in Dan's Feed & Seed and expanded his operation to include stores in Perris, Hemet, and Temecula. He also owns a grain handling facility in Blythe. As a result of his dedication to the business community, Mr. Harris is active in various civic groups in Perris. He is the past president and only remaining charter member of the Perris Rotary Club, past president of the Chamber of Commerce, past president of the Perris Farm Bureau, and the current president of the Perris Alumni Association. In 1994, Mr. Harrison received the Howie Award from the Riverside County Farm Bureau.  In 1953, he started the Perris Panthers 4-H club and was its leader until the mid-1960's. His continued involvement in the organization has produced one of the strongest 4-H clubs in Riverside County. Mr. Harrison has also been instrumental in the original organization of Perris Little League. Mr. Harrison has been a member and past president of the Farmers Fair Board and has served as chairman of the Farmers Fair Livestock Auction for 30 years. Due to his dedication, this auction is one of the most prosperous in the fair system, successfully raising money for the 4-H club and Future Farmers of America member's college tuition.  In recognition of his many accomplishments in various business and youth organizations in Perris, I commend John Harrison for his contributions and dedicated service to his community. I encourage Mr. Harrison to continue with his involvement and wish him much success and happiness in his future endeavors.                          ____________________
