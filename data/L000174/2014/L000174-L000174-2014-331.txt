President, on December 5, the world lost one of the greatest leaders of our era, and of any era, when Nelson Mandela died at the age of 95. His capacity for forgiveness was rivaled only by his courage. His actions serve as an example for the entire world. Having led South Africa out of its darkest period of history, Mandela focused on achieving national reconciliation to transition his government from minority rule and apartheid, to a multicultural democracy. He was successful in this endeavor because he believed in the importance of bringing people together, breaking down the barriers that defined, and imprisoned, many South Africans. For Nelson Mandela, the opportunity to lead meant the possibility of painting South African society on a blank canvas. It meant the possibility of creating a unified and free South Africa, rather than perpetuating a fractured mosaic defined by inequality.  We are fortunate to have leaders among us who share many of Nelson Mandela's qualities of leadership and a focus on human rights. Having served for nearly four decades in the Senate, I have had the privilege to serve with some of them. Dick Clark, a Senator from Iowa who was in the Senate when I was first elected, is one such individual, and his story is connected to Nelson Mandela's legacy. I not only served with Senator Clark but I travelled with him to Vermont and elsewhere. His sense of commitment and his conscience set a Senate standard that is rarely matched.  He was a fierce opponent of apartheid, and a recent POLITICO article recalls Dick Clark's efforts to raise awareness in Congress on the importance of the issue, and to push legislation that would distance the United States from the South African government's activities in the region. His efforts eventually contributed to his electoral loss at the end of his term, but that did not keep him from pursing his goals. I am pleased that during this important period of reflection, Dick Clark's contributions continue to be recognized.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the recent POLITICO article, A Nelson Mandela backstory: Iowa's Dick Clark, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:                       [POLITICO, Dec. 26, 2013]             A Nelson Mandela Backstory: Iowa's Dick Clark                           (By David Rogers)       Dick Clark was Mandela when Mandela wasn't cool.       A one-term Democratic senator from Iowa and for years      afterward a leader of congressional discussions on apartheid,      Clark is now 85 and long gone from the public scene. But the      ups and downs of his career are an intriguing back story--and      counterpoint--to the outpouring of praise for Nelson Mandela,      the black liberation leader and former president of South      Africa who died Dec. 5.       It wasn't always that way in Washington.       Indeed, Mandela turned 60 in South Africa's Robben Island      prison in the summer of 1978 even as Clark--chairman of the      African Affairs panel on the Senate Foreign Relations      Committee--was fighting for his own re-election in Iowa.       It was a time when Republican challenger Roger Jepsen felt      free to taunt the Democrat as ``the senator from Africa.''      Tensions were such that the State Department called in a      South African Embassy official in May for making disparaging      remarks about Clark in Iowa. And after Clark lost, South      Africa's ousted information secretary, Eschel Rhoodie, said      his government invested $250,000 to defeat Clark, who had      become a thorn in the side of the white regime.       Jepsen denied any knowledge of South Africa's alleged role.      Nor does Clark accuse him of such. But 35 years after, Clark      has no doubt that the apartheid government led by Prime      Minister B. J. Vorster wanted him out--and had a hand in his      defeat.       Clark's liberal record and support of the Panama Canal      Treaty, which narrowly cleared the Senate in the spring of      1978, also hurt his chances in Iowa. But the fatal blow was a      fierce wave of late-breaking ground attacks from anti-     abortion forces--something even conservative writers like      Robert Novak had not anticipated in a published column weeks      before.       ``Abortion was the issue, and how much effect this apparent      $250,000 had to do with promoting it more, I have no way of      evaluating it,'' Clark said in a recent interview at his home      in Washington. ``No question that they did it. They said they      did, and I think they did.''       Clark had made himself a target for South Africa with his      high-profile chairmanship of the Africa subcommittee. In      Washington as well, he was not without critics who accused      him of being too puritanical, too quick to fault U.S. policy.      But like no senator before him, Clark used the panel to raise      the visibility of human rights issues in the southern regions      of the continent. The roster of prior Africa subcommittee      chairs reads like a Who's Who of national Democrats: John      Kennedy in the late 1950s; Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore, father      of the future vice president; future Senate Majority Leader      Mike Mansfield; and former Vice President Hubert Humphrey      after his return to the Senate. But all stayed for just one      Congress before moving on. Clark stuck, challenging Cold War      policies that he believed hurt the larger struggle against      apartheid that Mandela symbolized.       ``He was the icebreaker here,'' says his friend Rep. George      Miller (D-Cal.). ``He was out breaking ice on Africa issues      for the country and certainly for the Senate.'' What's more,      after losing his Senate seat, Clark didn't stop. Instead, he      found a new classroom via the Aspen Institute, where the      former professor began what amounted to his own graduate      program in 1983 to educate members of Congress about      different policy issues.       Russia had been Clark's early academic interest and was as      well in his first years at Aspen. But Africa tugged and he      set out ``to try to get a get a cadre of Congress who would      know about South Africa and what was going on in South      Africa.''       These typically were nearly weeklong seminars--held at      choice locales overseas to lure members of Congress but also      to provide neutral ground for the warring parties inside      South Africa.       Bermuda, for example, served as a meeting place in 1989.      The island allowed officials from the South African      government to shuttle in and out before the arrival of      outlawed representatives for Mandela's African National      Congress, which was operating then from outside South Africa.       ``All of them were there, making their pitches,'' Clark      said. And once Mandela was released from prison in 1990, the      venue shifted to South Africa itself. ``We got Mandela, who      had just gotten out of jail not long before, to come,'' Clark      recalls of an April 1991 session in Cape Town--a seminar that      also included F. W. de Klerk, South Africa's white president.       Most striking here was Clark's impact on Republicans--the      party that helped to throw him out of the Senate.       ``He is a wonder,'' says former Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.).      ``I had been told he was a lefty, the stereotype, but he just      drew out people. He never showed bitterness toward the right      or promoting one side.''       Just as ``Mandela made a difference, Dick Clark made a      difference in awareness'' at home in Congress, Simpson adds.       Former Rep. John Porter (R-Ill.) remembers an Aspen meeting      in Cape Town at which Clark surprised the participants on the      last day by sending them out to walk through the      neighborhoods of a black township to meet with families.      ``Dick Clark would do things like that,'' Porter said.       ``This was before all the big changes in South Africa when      we were debating sanctions,'' said former Sen. John Danforth      (R-Mo.). ``He was just so dedicated to it and knew all the      players.'' In fact, Clark says he knew very little about      Africa before coming to the Senate after the 1972 elections.      But when a seat opened up on Foreign Relations in 1975, he      grabbed it and fell into the Africa post--just ahead of his      classmate Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.), the future vice      president. Timing is everything in Congress and it was      Clark's good fortune in this case. The legendary but very      controlling Foreign Relations Committee Chairman J. William      Fulbright (D-Ark.) had just left the Senate at the end of      1974 and this allowed subcommittee chairs like Clark to act      more on their own.       ``Fulbright's attitude was the subcommittees couldn't do      anything. Everything ought to be done by the full      committee,'' Clark said. ``I was next to last on seniority.      When it got down to me, the only thing left was Africa about      which I knew very little. Some would say none. So I just      figured: Here's a chance to learn something and I spent a lot      of time doing hearings and learning about Africa.''       He also traveled--venturing into southern, sub-Saharan      Africa which was then unfamiliar to many on the Senate      committee.       ``Humphrey told me that he got as far south as Ethiopia,''      Clark said. ``It was new territory and interesting and of      course we were putting a lot of covert money in Africa, as      were the Russians.'' In the summer of 1975, Clark and two      aides left Washington for what was to be a trip to just      Tanzania, Zambia and Zaire. But that itinerary quickly      expanded to include the two former Portuguese colonies,      Mozambique and Angola.       The Angola detour was pivotal and included face-to-face      meetings with Central Intelligence Agency personnel on the      ground as     well as the leaders of the three rival factions in Angola's      post-colonial civil war. The Soviet Union and Cuba were then      actively backing the new leftist government under Agostinho      Neto. The CIA and South Africa had begun a covert partnership      assisting rebel factions: chiefly Jonas Savimbi in the south,      but also Holden Roberto, whose base was more in the north and      Zaire.       Soon after Clark returned, the debate broke into the open      after news reports detailing the U.S. and South African      operations. Congress cut off new funding in a December 1975      appropriations fight. It then quickly enacted a more      permanent ban--the so-called Clark amendment--prohibiting      future covert assistance for paramilitary operations in      Angola.       Signed into law in February 1976, the Clark amendment was      repealed under President Ronald Reagan in 1985. Conservatives      long argued that it was always an overreach by Congress,      reacting to Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon's handling of      the Vietnam War.       ``The danger now is the pendulum will swing too far the      other way,'' Secretary of State Henry Kissinger warned      Clark's panel in a January 1976 hearing. But for all the      echoes of Vietnam, Clark says he saw his amendment more as a      way to separate the U.S. from South Africa's apartheid      regime.       ``The reason the amendment passed so easily in both houses      was because of Vietnam, so I certainly related the two,''      Clark said. ``But my interest was really in Africa and South      Africa. We were aligning ourselves with apartheid forces. The      reason for my amendment was to disassociate us from apartheid      and from South Africa.''       ``Kissinger had really no feeling for human rights that I      could ever discern and certainly not in South Africa,'' Clark      said. ``His association with South Africa was obviously very      close.'' A year later, visiting South Africa, Clark got a      taste of how closely the white government under Vorster had      been watching him.       That trip included an important meeting in Port Elizabeth      with the young black leader, Steve Biko, who had just been      released from jail and would die 10 months later after a      brutal interrogation in the summer of 1977. Clark said he      became a courier of sorts, taking back a Biko memorandum to      Jimmy Carter's incoming administration. But while in South      Africa, Vorster himself wanted to see Clark and spent much of      an hour quizzing the senator on his past public comments--     even down to small college appearances in the U.S. ``He spent      an hour with me,'' Clark said. ``They obviously had followed      me to each of these, much to my surprise.''       ``He would quote me. And then he would say, Did you say      that on such and such a date and such and such a place?' ``We      went through this for an hour. He just wanted the opportunity      to tell me how wrong I was about everything I was saying.''       ``He was the last great Afrikaner president,'' Clark said.      ``In fact, he ultimately resigned over the embarrassment of      the Muldergate thing years later.'' The Muldergate thing--as      Clark calls it--was a major scandal inside South Africa in      the late 1970s when it was revealed that government funds had      been used by the ruling National Party to mount a far-     reaching propaganda campaign in defense of apartheid.       This went well beyond placing favorable articles or opinion      pieces in the press. Tens of millions of dollars were      invested to try to undermine independent South African      papers. There was even a failed attempt in the U.S. to buy      the Washington Star in hopes of influencing American policy.      Muldergate got its name from Connie Mulder, South Africa's      information minister at the time. But just as Watergate had      its John Dean, Rhoodie--a top deputy to Mulder--proved the      top witness: a suave propagandist who later gave detailed      interviews and wrote his own book on the subject filling 900-     plus pages.       Rhoodie, who was prosecuted for fraud but cleared by an      appeals court in South Africa, ultimately relocated to the      U.S., where he died in Atlanta in 1993. But by his account,      the Vorster government had used its contacts with a Madison      Avenue public relations firm, Sydney S. Baron & Co. Inc., to      undermine Clark's reelection.       Rhoodie describes a meeting early in 1978 in South Africa      attended by Mulder, Vorster and Baron at which Clark's      election was specifically discussed, and the $250,000 was      later moved into one of Baron's accounts ``to make sure that      Clark was defeated.'' As South Africa's information      secretary, Rhoodie was in fact the signatory of contracts      with Baron, according to filings with the Justice Department.      These show the New York firm initially received about      $365,000 annually under a contract signed in April 1976. This      was increased to $650,000 a year later. In August 1977, the      same arrangement was extended through January 1979, including      a $250,000 payment in April 1978.       Whether this $250,000 is a coincidence or what Rhoodie was      speaking on is not clear. At this stage, most of the major      players are dead and New York state corporate records show      Baron's firm was dissolved in 1993--the year that Rhoodie      died.       Watching it all is Clark's friend, old boss in the House      and later Senate colleague, John Culver. The two met in 1964,      when Clark signed on to help Culver win his first House      election and then worked with Culver in Washington until      1972, when Clark went back to Iowa to run for the Senate. A      Harvard-educated Marine Corps veteran, Culver said he had his      own fascination with Africa as a young man in the 1960s. But      he remembered that era as a time of greater optimism, as new      countries across the continent were emerging from colonial      rule.       ``Dick came to it when there was less political reward,''      Culver said. ``But he stuck to it.''                          ____________________
