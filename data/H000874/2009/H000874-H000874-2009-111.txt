In addition, we will consider H.R. 3585, the Solar Technology and Roadmap Act of 2010, sponsored by Gabrielle Giffords, and H.R. 3619, the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010. In addition, we may consider Senate amendments to the House unemployment extension legislation, assuming that is passed by the Senate.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. Reclaiming my time, I thank the majority leader for that information. And knowing from time to time we do this, in watching the colloquy that you do with our whip, Mr. Cantor, I know last week you told him not to expect the health care bill on the floor until the last week in October at the earliest.  Do you still think this is the case, the last week of October?
