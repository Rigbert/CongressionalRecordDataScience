 President, there is substantial research that shows the way to make progress in eliminating poverty is to encourage healthy marriages, responsible fathership, full-time work, and education.  The poverty rate for married couple families is 5.5 percent. The overall poverty rate is 12.7 percent. The poverty rate for single-family households, if there is no husband, is 28 percent.  So it is quite obvious, poverty reduction should not be a partisan issue. We know what we need to do to reduce poverty. So we need to roll up our sleeves, work together, strengthen marriage, strengthen fatherhood, promote education, and get people full-time work. That is the way to end poverty. Statistics prove it.  I make the point that the pending amendment is not germane to the measure now before the Senate, and I raise a point of order against it under section 305 of the Budget Act.
