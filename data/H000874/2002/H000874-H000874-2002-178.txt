Speaker, a week and a day ago, Charles County, Calvert County, and Dorchester County in Maryland were hit by a tornado. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring to your attention a truly remarkable individual from my district who is helping us respond to that tornado.  As you know, Southern Maryland was recently devastated by what is believed to be the second most powerful tornado ever to hit the East Coast. It is tough times like these, Mr. Speaker, that brings out the best of what America has to offer, for those who have lost a great deal themselves rise to the occasion to help others who are in need.  Mr. Paul Facchina is a tremendous example of one such extraordinary person who heads up a company peopled by extraordinary individuals. Mr. Facchina owns and operates Facchina Construction in LaPlata, Maryland. That small town in Charles County completely lost 48 businesses in the matter of minutes that the tornado took to pass through. Lawyers' offices, banks, convenience stores, fast food restaurants, grocery stores, a lumber yard, all destroyed.  Mr. Paul Facchina's company was among those that were decimated, and he has every intention of rebuilding abrand new headquarters, which he happened to have already planned just across the street from the one that was destroyed. And though he and his employees are busy finalizing plans for the new building, while at the same time cleaning up the old, he did not forget about those other businesses in LaPlata that were destroyed and put out of business.                              {time}  1915  Instead, Facchina Construction began work on a ``temporary town center'' just hours after the powerful F5 tornado ripped through the county.  Recognizing the devastation that loss of customers could mean to his neighboring small businesses, Paul Facchina acted quickly to create a 2-acre home for them on company property in the center of LaPlata's business district. This temporary town center will consist of 21 office trailers, complete with utilities and a paved parking lot to accommodate any LaPlata business that was displaced by the tornado. On Friday after Congress adjourned, I was on the Facchina construction site. It was amazing what they had done in the 4 days since the tornado hit, plumbing being installed, pads being prepared.  And what does Mr. Facchina ask for in return for his generosity, the generosity of his company and his people? Nothing more than what a business can afford to pay. If they are not doing any business because they have been blown out of the water, so to speak, they will not pay anything. Otherwise, they will pay a commensurate lease.  Facchina Construction is no stranger to disaster response. The company was on site at the Pentagon on September 11, and crews were involved in the subsequent rescue and recovery of people in the Pentagon. Facchina headed up the restoration of the damage to the Pentagon and recently completed the project 3\1/2\ months ahead of schedule. They made it clear to the world that we have healed our physical wounds and are moving ahead with the business of this country.  Mr. Speaker, there are those who say that capitalism inevitably creates a dog-eat-dog world in which only the strong survive. Mr. Speaker, I offer to them the example of Facchina Construction and Mr. Paul Facchina. In a time of turmoil, we rely on people like this to remind us what America is about and to tell those whose lives have been turned upside down that everything will be okay.  The author said in a ``Tale of Two Cities'': ``It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.'' Sunday, 7 p.m. a week ago was the worst of times in LaPlata, Maryland. We lost five people to that tornado; but Paul Facchina and his people and neighbors, neighbors who had been hit by the tornado, neighbors whose houses had been spared, businesses hit by the tornado came out into the streets right after that tornado passed to help their neighbors, help their community say that they were not going to be defeated by nature, as we have not been defeated by terrorists.  Mr. Speaker, we all owe a debt of gratitude to these courageous people.                          ____________________
