 That is one way you can do it. I don't think that makes a lot of sense.  I think the evidence suggests that if we are serious about providing quality health care to every man, woman, and child in a cost-effective way, then our country must move to a publicly funded, single-payer, Medicare-for-all approach. Our current private health insurance system is the most costly, wasteful, complicated, and bureaucratic in the world. The function of a private health insurance company is not--underline ``not''--to provide health care to people, it is to make as much money as possible. In fact, every dollar of health care that is denied a patient, an American, is another dollar the company makes.  With 1,300 private insurance companies and thousands of different health benefit programs designed to maximize profits, private health insurance companies spend an incredible 30 percent of each health care dollar on administration and billing, exorbitant CEO compensation packages, advertising, lobbying, and campaign contributions. Aren't we all delighted to know our health care dollars are now circulating all over the Halls of Congress, paying outrageous sums of money to lobbyists, making sure we do not do the right thing for the American people? Public programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and the Veterans' Administration are administered for far, far less than private health insurance.  Let me conclude by saying that I understand that the power of the insurance companies and the drug companies, the medical company suppliers--the medical equipment suppliers--is so significant, so powerful that we are not going to pass a single-payer, Medicare-for-all program. But at the very least, what polls overwhelmingly show is that the American people want a strong, Medicare-like public option in order to compete with the private insurance companies. That is the very least we can and must do for the American people.  I yield the floor.
