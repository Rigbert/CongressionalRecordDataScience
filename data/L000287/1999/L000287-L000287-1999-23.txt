Mr. Speaker, the supporters of Most Favored Nation status may have changed the name to ``Normal Trade Relations,'' but the situation in China has not changed. In fact, the conditions are getting worse.  Just a few days ago, the Chinese government conducted its largest crackdown since Tiananmen Square. Thousands of religious worshippers were arrested. Chinese soldiers took people from their homes and places of worship. Some were beaten. The human rights abuses continue, and yet there are those who would reward China with MFN.  Business as usual, trade as usual, and China does not change. We are sending the wrong message. We have a moral obligation, a mission, and a mandate to stand up for human rights and for democracy. We must send a strong message that China must change its ways if it wants to continue doing business with the United States. Our foreign policy, our trade policy must be a reflection of our ideals and values. Renewing MFN allows China to continue its terrible abuses without repercussion. That is not right.  Where are our morals? Where are our values? Where are our principles? I believe in free and fair trade, but it must not be trade at any price, and the price of renewing MFN for China is too high.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. I want to thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi) for taking the leadin standing up for human rights and for democracy in China.
