We are seeing expenses for the Government--the war in Iraq, the various disasters that have hit--exploding to the point where people are saying, well, let us hold off on giving senior citizens some help with their prescription drugs.  I think what the Senator is saying is, before one takes those kinds of steps, put the brakes on the opportunity for ripping off taxpayers.  I want to ask the Senator a question that really stunned me. There are now about 392,000 Federal employees who have these credit cards across the country. We have been trying to figure out how many folks have them on the gulf coast and how many of the folks have this $250,000 authority. The two of us feel very strongly that there are a lot of dedicated people down there who are working very hard and nobody is suggesting otherwise, but what possible argument would there be for not having something along the lines of some guardrails to try to make sure that people did not abuse these credit cards?  That strikes me as a pretty modest step, just have some guardrails rather than saying, look, go out and take $250,000 worth of authority and we will see what happens.
