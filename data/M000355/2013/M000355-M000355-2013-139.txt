 I have mentioned to the administration on several occasions: Send us up two nominees who are not illegally appointed. But we cannot seem to get that done. I mean, the taint attached to the two NLRB nominees and to Mr. Cordray, who I agree is a good man and many of my Members support, is that they were illegally appointed.  But, of course, the agencies have not been at a disadvantage. They are therewaiting. He may have been waiting to be confirmed, but he is not waiting to do the job. He is in office. The two NLRB members are in office. The question is, do we respect the law? A Federal court has said the two NLRB members were illegally appointed.  Mr. Cordray, unfortunately, was appointed on exactly the same day in exactly the same way. Is the Senate completely lawless? Do we not care what the Federal courts say? I am stunned at where we are. It is pretty clear to me that all the other nominees are highly likely to be confirmed.  What it comes down to is that the majority leader is going to break the rules of the Senate to change the rules of the Senate in order to confirm, with 51 votes, three illegally appointed positions that the Federal courts have told us are unconstitutionally appointed. That is the rationale for the nuclear option?  That is why I say it is a sad day for the Senate, a sad day for America.
