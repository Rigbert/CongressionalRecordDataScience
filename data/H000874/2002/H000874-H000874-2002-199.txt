Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.  Continuing under my reservation, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. McKeon), and thank him for providing for such a rapid consideration of this resolution.  Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. From the other side of the country I also, Mr. Speaker, would like to rise in support of House Resolution 383. This resolution congratulates the University of Maryland Terrapins for winning the 2002 NCAA Basketball Championship.  As my colleagues know, the Terrapins finished the 2002 season with 32 wins. This is quite an accomplishment and one that we should recognize. I would also like to congratulate Coach Gary Williams, who led the team during this victorious season. Many good things have been said about him, and I would like to recognize and associate myself with those words.  I would also like to thank our colleague, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), for introducing this resolution, and our colleague, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Gilchrest), for bringing this resolution to my attention. I would ask all of my colleagues for their support.
