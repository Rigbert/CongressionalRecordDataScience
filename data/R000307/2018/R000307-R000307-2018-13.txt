President, with 171 amendments and a vote of 86 to 11, obviously, getting this farm bill done has been a tremendous team effort. You are only as good as your staff on both sides of the aisle, and they make us look good when we stand up here a little confused trying to get things a little sorted out.  I wish to thank my staff: James Glueck, DaNita Murray, Janae Brady, Fred Clark, Meghan Cline, Haley Donahue, Matt Erickson, Darin Guries, Chance Hunley, Chu Hwang, Chelsie Keys, Sarah Little, Curt Mann, Andy Rezendes, Bob Rosado, Anthony Seiler, Wayne Stoskopf--who, by the way, knows more about farm programs than anybody else on the staff, myself included--Andrew Vlasaty, and Katherine Thomas.  I also want to mention Jackie Cottrell, Amber Kirchhoefer, Will Stafford, Morgan Anderson, and Stacy Daniels in my personal office.  I want to especially thank the ranking member--vice chairman, really--Senator Stabenow, and her team, led by the indomitable Joe Shultz and Jacqlyn Schneider. The efforts of Jessie Williams, Amanda Kelly, Bobby Mehta, Katie Salay, and Micah Wortham have been valuable to the Ag Committee process.  Additionally, I thank the technical support from the Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, and the staff at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Thank you so much for your help.  I also appreciate the work of the Congressional Budget Office staff, including: Tiffany Arthur, Megan Carroll, Kathleen FitzGerald, Jennifer Gray, Jim Langley, and Robert Reese.  I now yield to my distinguished ranking member, Senator Stabenow.  I say to the Senator, thank you for being such a great partner.
