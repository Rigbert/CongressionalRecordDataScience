Since 1969, the Army Aviation Association has presented this award to the best Army National Guard aviation unit. Indeed, it is a great honor to represent the State of this year's winner, the 1st Battalion, 126th Aviation Regiment of the Rhode Island Army National Guard.  The 1st of the 126th has a long and distinguished history. Tracing its roots back to 1930 and the 68th Field Artillery Brigade, the 1st of the 126th was founded as a field artillery unit and later transitioned to medical care specialists. But in the 1960s, the unit was reorganized into an aviation unit. Since that time, it has performed with extraordinary professionalism and skill in its role as an aviation unit.  Deployed to Iraq from January to December of 2005, the 1st of the 126th served as the core of Task Force Dragonwing during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Task Force Dragonwing, based out of Balad Airbase north of Baghdad, was the lead force responsible for conducting combat support aviation operations through the entire Iraqi theater. They accumulated over 16,000 hours of combat mission flight hours during nearly 2,000 missions while transporting 66,000 passengers and 5,000 tons of cargo. During their tour, they flew 46 missions in direct action against known or suspected anti-Iraqi forces, and 22 missions were subjected to known surface-to-air fire, with 7 aircraft receiving battle damage. Throughout the professional performance of their duties, no members of the unit were killed or seriously injured.  The 1st of the 126th is comprised of 457 soldiers who man and maintain 24 UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters and 12 CH-47 Chinook helicopters. Their mission is to perform air assault and movement operations and to provide command, control, supervision, staff planning, and logistical support to all units affiliated with the battalion.  During one of my visits to Iraq, I had the great honor and opportunity to fly with them, to observe their unit firsthand. In fact, I was honored to be accompanied by GEN John Abizaid, whose comments about their skill and professionalism brought great pride to me and all Rhode Islanders. This unit was ably commanded by COL Chris Callahan and was led by soldiers, pilots, and crew members with great skill and courage and professionalism.  I was, indeed, honored and thrilled to be with them in Iraq, to see their operation, to see the contribution they made to our effort in Iraq. The 1st of the 126th has proven itself an exceptional unit and deserves to be selected by the Army Aviation Association as the top aviation unit for 2005. They have served their country with honor. We are all proud of their service, in the State of Rhode Island and throughout the Nation. Indeed, it is heartwarming to see them being recognized nationally for their great success, their great service to the Nation, and their great professionalism. I commend Colonel Callahan and all the officers and personnel of that unit for their service, for their sacrifice, for their dedication to our country.                          ____________________[Page S4830]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                    RHODE ISLAND ARMY NATIONAL GUARD
