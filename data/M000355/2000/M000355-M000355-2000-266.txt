 President, despite the Administration's objection to expanding the favorable tax treatment of these state plans, I am pleased that Congress has achieved real reform over the past several years.  In 1996, Congress took the first step in providing tax relief to families investing in these programs. In the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, I was able to include a provision that clarified the tax treatment of state-sponsored savings plans and the participants' investment. This measure put an end to the tax uncertainty that has hampered the effectiveness of these state-sponsored programs and helped families who are trying to save for their children's education.  In 1997, the Taxpayer Relief Act made revisions to provide increased flexibility to families saving for their children's college education. The most significant reform was to expand the definition of ``qualified education costs'' to include room and board, thus doubling the amount families could save tax-free.  As a result of our actions over the last several years, more and more state plans have implemented tuition savings and prepaid plans for their residents. It is projected that there will be 44 states with tuition savings plans by the year 2000. I believe that we have a real opportunity to go even further toward making college affordable to American families. It is in our best interest as a nation to maintain a quality and affordable education system for everyone. By passing this legislation, we can help families help themselves by rewarding savings. This will reduce the cost of education and will not unnecessarily burden future generations with thousands of dollars in loans.  In addition to making savings in qualified State and private college tuition plans completely tax-free, this legislation makes a number of other changes that are essential to helping families afford a quality education. Specifically, this legislation increases the contributions for K-12 education savings accounts to help families meet the expenses of a primary education. This legislation creates incentives for employer-provided educational assistance so that individuals can continue their education while working. This legislation also changes the rules for interest deductions so that qualified education loans are more affordable for students. Additionally, this legislation revises the National Health Corps Scholarships Exclusion, increases the arbitrage rebate exception on tax-exempt bonds, provides for private activity bonds for qualified education facilities, and allows the Federal Home Loan Bank to guarantee school construction bonds. These important reforms are critical to helping families save for the future.  I urge my colleagues to support this valuable legislation this year to reward those who save in order to provide a college education for their children.                               Exhibit 1               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 30, 2000]                   Section 529 College Savings Plans                                Rate an A                         (By Jane Bryant Quinn)       If you haven't yet heard about state Section 529 savings      plans, listen up. They're a great way for parents or      grandparents to build a college fund.       These plans drip with income-tax and estate-tax breaks and      offer a potential for gain that older college plans can't      touch. Many top plans are open to residents of any state.       Until recently, 529s were marketed by the states themselves      or by two no-load mutual-fund groups--Fidelity and TIAA-     CREF--that some states have hired to manage their money.       Brokers and financial planners who work for commissions      weren't paid to sell 529s, so they steered your college money      somewhere else.       But now, two big brokerage firms are also in the game,      selling state 529 plans to a national clientele. Merrill      Lynch hitched up with Maine's NextGen program. Salomon Smith      Barney has Colorado's Scholars Choice plan and will soon      offer West Virginia's plan.       This creates an army of brokers prepared to tout this new      form of investing to the public. Commercial sales should help      get more people talking about 529s.       State 529 plans (the name refers to a section of the IRS      Code) were authorized by Congress in 1996. You can invest      lump sums or make regular monthly contributions. The plans      come in two forms:       A prepaid tuition plan. The conservative choice. These      plans guarantee that the money you save today will match the      growth in tuition inflation at state-run colleges. Currently,      that's an effective 3.4 percent return. You can also use the      money for tuition at out-of-state schools.       A college savings plan. Here, you contribute to an      investment pool that has the potential of rising faster than      the college inflation rate (although there's no guarantee).      You can use the money at any accredited school, for any      qualified education expense.       Savings plans are currently offered by 23 states, and nine      more are starting up this year. If your state doesn't have a      savings plan, or has one with unattractive features, you can      join one in another state.       A few states keep your money in bonds, but most provide a      mix of stocks and bonds. A typical 529 account leans heavily      toward stocks when the child is young, then moves      automatically toward safer bonds and money-market funds as      college draws near.       Some states give you a choice of accounts. Maine, for      example, offers four accounts--one of which is 100 percent      invested in stocks.       Under 529 rules, you can't switch your money from one      account to another within the plan. To diversify, you'd      contribute to more than one account, says Maine's treasurer,      Dale McCormick.       Here's the beauty of 529 plans. All the earnings accumulate      tax-deferred. When you take out the money for higher      education, it's taxed in your child's bracket, not yours.       Some states let you deduct your contribution on your state      tax return. Other states let your earnings pass tax-free.       The value of the plan is not included in your taxable      estate. But you still control the money, says certified      public accountant and 529 expert Joseph Hurley of Bonadio &      Co. in Pittsford, N.Y.       You can change the plan's beneficiary from one family      member to another (including an adult seeking further      education). You can even drop the plan and take your money      back.       If you spend 529 money on something other than higher      education, that withdrawal will be taxed in your bracket.      You'll also pay a penalty--typically 10 percent of earnings      (sometimes more).       ``A 10 percent penalty on earnings isn't bad,'' Hurley      says. ``If your account yielded 10 percent, you'd still net 9      percent, pretax.''       Surprisingly, 529 savings plans detract little or nothing      from your child's potential financial-aid award. The money is      treated as belonging to the donor, not the student.       Hurley gives top marks to the plans in the following      states: Arkansas (1-877-422-6553), Colorado (1-800-478-5651),      Maine (1-877-563-9843), Missouri (1-888-414-6678), New      Hampshire (1-800-544-1722), Utah (1-800-418-2551) and      Virginia (888-567-0540).
