APPLICATION OF COUNTERVAILING DUTIES TO NONMARKET                    ECONOMIES AND STRENGTHENING APPLICATION OF THE                    LAW.       (a) In General.--Section 701(a)(1) of the Tariff Act of      1930 (19 U.S.C. 1671(a)(1)) is amended by inserting      ``(including a nonmarket economy country)'' after ``country''      each place it appears.       (b) Use of Alternate Methodologies Involving China.--     Section 771(5)(E) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C.      1677(5)(E)) is amended by adding at the end the following:      ``If the administering authority encounters special      difficulties in identifying and calculating the amount of a      benefit under clauses (i) through (iv) with respect to an      investigation or review involving the People's Republic of      China, without regard to whether the administering authority      determines that China is a nonmarket economy country under      paragraph (18) of this section, the administering authority      shall use methodologies to identify and calculate the amount      of the benefit that take into account the possibility that      terms and conditions prevailing in China may not always be      available as appropriate benchmarks. In applying such      methodologies, where practicable, the administering authority      should take into account and adjust terms and conditions      prevailing in China before using terms and conditions      prevailing outside of China. If the administering authority      determines that China is a nonmarket economy country under      paragraph (18) of this section, the administering authority      shall presume, absent a demonstration of compelling evidence      to the contrary, that special difficulties exist in      calculating the amount of a benefit under clauses (i) through      (iv) with respect to an investigation or review involving      China and that it is not practicable to take into account and      adjust terms and conditions prevailing in China, and the      administering authority shall use terms and conditions      prevailing outside of China.''.       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsections (a)      and (b) apply to petitions filed under section 702 of the      Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1671a) on or after October 1,      2006.
