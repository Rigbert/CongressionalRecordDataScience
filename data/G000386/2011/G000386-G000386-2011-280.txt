 President, I have the sad task today of paying tribute to Specialist Shawn A. Muhr of Coon Rapids, IA, who has fallen in the line of duty in Afghanistan. Specialist Muhr was serving with the 546th Transportation Company, 264th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion, 82nd Sustainment Brigade out of Fort Bragg, NC. He was 26 years old.  Shawn's family described him as ``a gentle person with an adventurousspirit.'' He is remembered fondly as a happy and generous individual, and I know his loss will be felt very keenly by all who knew him. My thoughts and prayers will be with his family at this time, including his wife Winifred, his father David, and his mother Shirley as well as his brother and sisters.  By all accounts, Specialist Muhr liked being in the Army and loved serving his country. He had previously served in Operation Iraqi Freedom as well as in South Korea and was serving his first tour in Afghanistan. What would we do without individuals like Shawn Muhr? Those young people who gladly serve their country, knowing the sacrifices they will be asked to make and the tremendous risk they take, are the ultimate bulwark in defense of our freedom. Shawn Muhr truly lived and died by the motto of the great State of Iowa, ``Our Liberties We Prize, Our Rights We Will Maintain.''                          ____________________
