Speaker, on December 7, 1975, Indonesia invaded the small country of East Timor and began two decades of violent occupation and repression. More than 200,000 East Timorese have been killed or have died of starvation since the invasion of the Indonesian Government. Portugal continues to protest Indonesia's invasion, and the United Nations has never recognized Indonesia's claim on East Timor. Both the Security Council and the General Assembly have issued numerous resolutions reaffirming East Timor's right to self-determination. However, these actions have been ineffective.  Tragically, we are still witnessing the harsh reality of this invasion. Massacres, disappearances, suppression of free speech, and human rights abuses have consistently been reported since the invasion. In November 1991, the world was outraged by the Santa Cruz massacre where Indonesian soldiers opened fire into an unarmed crowd, killing more than 250 people; in June of 1994, Indonesian troops committed acts of sacrilege against the East Timorese Church and clergy; in July 1994, a clash between East Timorese students and Indonesian troops in response to this incident left 18 students injured; and in January of this year, Indonesian soldiers kidnapped, tortured, and murdered six civilians.  At a joint hearing before the International Relations Subcommittees on Asia and the Pacific and International Operations and Human Rights on March 16, the Director of the Human Rights Watch stated: ``In East Timor, violations of fundamental rights has been especially severe, and have worsened dramatically since the APEC summit meeting in Jakarta last November.''  Congress has acted on behalf of the people of East Timor, but I believe we must do more. The United States must not tolerate continued human rights abuses by the military in East Timor. We must not turn our backs on the East Timorese, who, against great odds, have resisted the Indonesian invasion for 20 years. The U.S. should not let another 20 years of human rights abuses and oppression pass. I commend my colleagues Representatives Kennedy and Lowey for their efforts to recognize this anniversary on behalf of the people of East Timor, and for introducing the East Timor Human Rights Accountability Act of 1995. I urge my colleagues to continue to condemn acts of violence by the Indonesian Government against the people of East Timor.                          ____________________
