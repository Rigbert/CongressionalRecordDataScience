President, is because I know in the House of Representatives they have been concerned that the money might not be there.  I think we all want to accomplish these things for the victims. I just want to make sure we are not holding out a promise that we can't complete. Do I agree with all the fines going into this fund? Absolutely. But the experience of a lot of prosecutors I have talked with is that the court may say: I fine you $20,000 or $30,000, but this is never paid. They go to prison. They have no assets. We are spending $25,000 to $35,000 a year as taxpayers keeping them in prison, and I want them to be in prison, but there is no money for victims.
