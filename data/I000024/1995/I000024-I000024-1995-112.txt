President, during the August recess, I had about seven events each day and never passed up the opportunity to let them know about the most critical threat facing America today--missile attack. I spoke about the fact that the actions we take today will directly affect the kind of defense posture our country has in 5 to 7 years.  The danger we face is real. Yet I was surprised and shocked at the ambivalence and lack of understanding that exists concerning this vital issue. Many people simply do not realize--and are themselves shocked to be told--that our country today has no missile defense system in place capable of protecting American cities from long range missile attacks.  I estimated that perhaps most Oklahomans were not readily aware of some of the basic terms of the debate currently going on in Washington about the important missile defense provisions of the current defense authorization bill.  I would suggest that part of the reason for this has to do with the media, particularly the national media, most of which has either not adequately focused on this issue or has skewed it in such a way as to downgrade its importance. But there are also similar problems with the local media.  For example, in Oklahoma there are two major daily newspapers, the daily Oklahoman and the Tulsa World. Their differences reflect similar disparities in the national media.  The Tulsa World reflects a consistent liberal view of the world, one which favors the expansion of the role of government in almost every area except defense. Their left-leaning editorial view tends to distort the reality of significant issues such as missile defense.  The daily Oklahoman, on the other hand, much more clearly reflects the conservative social and economic values of Oklahomans. It is a larger paper and provides a much more realistic approach to issues such as national defense.  During the past month, each of these papers had major editorials on the threat of missile attack. There is quite a difference in their approach. I think it will be instructive for my colleagues to examine these editorials and ponder how the media is shaping the debate about vital issues facing our country.  I therefore ask unanimous consent that the two editorials I mentioned concerning missile defense--one from the Tulsa World and one from the daily Oklahoman--be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the editorials were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  [From the Oklahoman, Aug. 20, 1995]                         For the Common Defense       The Clinton administration's attachment to a pair of      international agreements has the potential to weaken U.S.      defenses against a foreign attack.       President Clinton last week announced the United States      would cease future nuclear weapons tests in hopes of      energizing stalled talks aimed at producing a worldwide test      ban.       At the same time, Clinton's threatened veto of the defense      authorization bill--because it orders development of a      national missile defense system--is behind efforts to water      down the missile defense part of the bill.       It's a double-whammy for U.S. national security.       First, although declaring a U.S. nuclear test ban looks      great on television and might evoke comparisons with John F.      Kennedy (something Clinton wouldn't mind), it's quite a leap      of faith minus guarantees the Russians will do likewise.       Also, Pentagon officials are concerned a test ban will make      it impossible to guarantee the reliability of America's 7,000      nuclear weapons. Sen. John Warner, R-Va., says doubt about      the U.S. arsenal could even invite a nuclear attack.       Alarmingly, it appears Clinton cares more about reviving      world test ban talks than he does about protecting the United      States.       Concerning national missile defense, the Senate bill      mandates a system to protect the country from deliberate or      accidental missile attack. But Clinton has threatened a veto,      saving it would violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile      Treaty signed with the then-Soviet Union.       Recently four senators proposed an amendment to allow      missile defense planning but delaying deployment pending      congressional review. It also would permit the president to      negotiate changes in the ABM treaty to allow a missile      defense.       Sounds pretty good, but some analysts say the amendment,      which will be voted on when Congress returns from its August      recess, could be a subtle way to kill a missile defense      system.       Baker Spring of the conservative Heritage Foundation says      the amendment's delaying aspects would allow Clinton, who      opposes missile defense, ``to strangle programs in the      crib.'' Spring says it seems as if ``we're saying the ABM      treaty comes first, the defense of the nation comes second.''       Finally, Clinton argues two mutually exclusive ideas.      First, he says existing nuclear weapons can defend America,      making a missile defense unnecessary. Then he says the United      States will quit the testing that ensures the reliability of      current weapons systems. Huh?       Clinton can't have it both ways. The Senate should insist      on moving ahead with a missile defense program.                                                                    ____                 [From the Tulsa World, Aug. 14, 1995]                         Pork, Republican Style       Right-wing Republicans in Congress are pushing a bill that      would force the Pentagon to develop a multi-site national      missile defense system by 2003. This is the latest      incarnation of the Star Wars program, a science-fiction anti-     missile system that blossomed during the Reagan      administration.       There are many reasons why this outrageously expensive      scheme should be put to sleep once and for all.       First, it would have to work perfectly in order to protect      American cities and military bases from nuclear weapons. It      would do little good to knock down 19 out of 20 nuclear-     tipped missiles aimed at, say, New York. The 20th bomb would      do the job. Anyone who works with computers and other      electronic equipment knows from personal experience that this      goal of perfect performance is impossible.       Even if science could find a perfect way to frustrate a      missile weapons system with a 100-percent success rate, the      same science could just as easily find the means to frustrate      the anti-missile system. So, the next logical step would be      an anti-anti-missile system, a weapon to knock out or to      disable the anti-missile defense system. It wouldn't have to      be disabled completely--just enough to get a few nuclear      devices through the ``shield.''       But there are more urgent reasons why this is a bad idea.      It would violate the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty with      the former Soviet Union. This pointless provocation does not      reduce the risk of nuclear war. It increases it.       Finally, it is an insult to the budget-balancing process.      It is unbelievable that this wasteful scheme is being      advanced at the      same time Americans are being asked to accept cuts in such things as      education, care for the elderly and medical help for the      poor.       John Isaacs, spokesman for an arms control advocacy group,      explained part of the problem: ``Defending pork is a      bipartisan pastime. It is endorsed by both Democrats and      Republicans.''       Star Wars is the right-wing Republican version of pork.
