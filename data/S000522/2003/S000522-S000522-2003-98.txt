Mr. Speaker, before yielding back, I do want to thank and commend the hard work of committee staff, Devon Seibert, Paige McManus, Darryl Kehrer, Patrick Ryan, Kingston Smith, Jim Holley, Mary Ellen McCarthy, Geoffrey Collver, Leah Booth and so many others who have made this legislation and all the bills that we work cooperatively on with my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans), to bring to the floor what we think are quality, well-vetted, very thoughtful pieces of legislation that make the difference in the lives of veterans and their families.  This is another example of that kind of cooperation. This is the way thisbody should work, and it is so good to see us again working hand-in-glove in this partnership. Again, I want to thank the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Brown) and the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Michaud) for their good work as chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee. I urge all Members to support this bill.
