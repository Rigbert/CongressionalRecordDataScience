  Now, Mr. Majority Leader, based on what you are saying, there will be no bill at all that would go to conference; ergo no bill, period. That is what I find very disturbing.  I am prepared to vote for the McCain bill, with the view that it goes to conference, and perhaps some of the ideas that Senator Hatch and I, and others, Senator Jeffords, Senator Breaux, Senator Torricelli have--that might prevail in a conference setting. So I will just, most respectfully, urge you to reconsider, vote out this bill. Let us not give up the issue of tobacco reform.  I thank the Chair for your forbearance. I yield the floor.
