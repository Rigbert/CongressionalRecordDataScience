 President, I would like to raise an important issue impacting close to 60 independent children's hospitals across the Nation and numerous sick children and their families: the need for full funding for graduate medical education (GME) at our Nation's freestanding children's hospitals to train pediatricians.  Independent children's hospitals face a serious financial burden and competitive disadvantage because they do not receive GME support through Medicare. Medicare is the only source of significant and stable GME support available to hospitals for the training of medical residents. In the absence of any movement towards GME reform, the children's hospitals GME discretionary grant program was enacted to ensure that these institutions could sustain their teaching programs--programs that are important not only to the future of these children's hospitals and their essential services, but also to the future of the pediatric workforce and pediatric research.
