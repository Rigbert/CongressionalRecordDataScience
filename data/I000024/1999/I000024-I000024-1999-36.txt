DORGAN. Let me finish my statement.  They do not support arms control treaties. I respect that. I just think they are dead wrong. I have on my desk--I ask consent to show it again--a piece of a bomber. This is a piece of a Backfire bomber, a Russian bomber. Why is a Russian bomber in a circumstance where its wing was sawed off--not shot down, its wing sawed off? Because arms control agreements have reduced the number of delivery systems and nuclear weapons.  This part was sawed off a Russian bomber wing as part of the reduction of the threat under our arms control treaties. These treaties work. We know they work. That is why, without shooting down a bomber, I have a piece of a Russian Backfire bomber wing, just to remind us that arms control treaties work.
