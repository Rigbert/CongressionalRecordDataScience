Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my strong support for the United Nations' International Labor Organization (ILO) Worldwide Workers' Rights public awareness poster campaign. The goal of this initiative is not only to make people aware of the shameful atrocities workers suffer around the world, but to say that all workers have basic, fundamental rights. The right to form a union, bargain collectively, work free of discrimination, refuse forced labor, and to reject child labor. These moral and humane worker rights should and must be honored both in the job field and during international trade and other agreements. We cannot look the other way when these issues come before us.  I would like to ask my colleagues how they would feel if their family, loved ones, and children were forced to work under conditions where basic labor and human rights were eroded by the lack of enforceable labor protections. Unfortunately, the ILO estimates that about 250 million children between the ages of 5 and 14 are in the workforce, half of which are employed full-time, often in dangerous industries. During hearings I held as Chairman of the House Subcommittee on International Relations and Human Rights in previous sessions of Congress it became obvious that children often labor under unsafe conditions. These young people frequently go to work in dangerous factories or mines, not to mentionthe despicable business of child pornography and prostitution. Legislation I introduced, which was passed by the full House, would have authorized $30 million per year from fiscal years 1999 to 2001 for the International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor (IPEC). This organization has identified the need for specific programs in dangerous industries where child labor is prevalent.  While well intentioned efforts have been made on behalf of these children, not enough has been done. Child labor continues to grow in many countries around the world. Regrettably, some of the trade agreements approved by Congress, such as the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) status for China, have compounded the worldwide child labor problem. Unfortunately, the idea of linking worker rights and child labor laws with trade policy is still in the early stage of development.  Nations should not be recognized and rewarded with profitable trade agreements for their systematic violation of internationally recognized workers' rights. These rights must be considered when we discuss plans to expand NAFTA or address our current trade relation agreements with The Peoples Republic of China. Although on paper, virtually every country in the world has outlawed child labor in its cruelest forms, in reality, hundreds of millions of children are still being robbed of childhood for the profit of others.  We can no longer look the other way when basic fundamental labor and children rights are denied or broken. These rights must be addressed head-on and in the most straightforward way. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pledge their active support for the basic labor rights brought to the forefront by the ILO's declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work.                          ____________________
