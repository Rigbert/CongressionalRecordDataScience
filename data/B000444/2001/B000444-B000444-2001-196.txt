 President, the fact of the matter is, we are never going to make any really fundamental change in the system until we adopt the position of setting limits on the total amount of money that can be spent in a single State on a single election.  Our approach provides the candidates with partial public financing when they commit to voluntary limits, and if the other person does not commit tothose voluntary limits, then we allow that funding to go up so that person can keep in parity with the person against whom they are running.  It is a simple, basic proposition. By the way, it is complementary to the so-called soft money ban. It is not contrary to, it does not undermine it; it is complementary to the ban on soft money.
