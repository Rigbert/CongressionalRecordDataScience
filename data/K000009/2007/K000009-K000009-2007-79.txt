Speaker, I appreciate the chairman's yielding me the time even though I rise in opposition to this bill and to any bill that will continue to outsource more U.S. jobs, increase our trade deficit, and not stop the import of illegal narcotics into this country.  This is another one of those bills cast in NAFTA model that is already yielding over $10 billion a year in trade deficits to this country by the outsourcing of our jobs. Why would we want to do more?  The American people elected us to make a difference. They are expecting us to be different than the Thomas committee. Why are we delivering the same kind of bills to this floor?  Procedurally, this bill is being brought up overnight without Members even having the opportunity to read a text. I don't know who made that decision. I doubt it was anyone on this floor. But for people who represent districts like ours, it is truly a tragedy.  One fact we are certain of is that NAFTA-type agreements have cost more jobs, more job losses, more trade deficit every time one of these bills comes to the floor. When are we going to learn?  The idea of the Andean agreement was that it would help to displace coca production with other economic enterprises, and yet we see coca production increasing and more of those illegal drugs coming over our border. When something isn't working, you ought to fix it.  We look at the provisions dealing with labor enforcement. There is no enforcement, especially in the farm-related positions, in the flour industry, in the asparagus industry, and so forth. There is no enforcement in those countries. Why would we do this?  I would love to be a Member of this Congress when a trade agreement is advanced that creates jobs in the United States of America, which is our first responsibility, rather than outsourcing; that yields trade surpluses, not growing deficits that are such a huge drag on this economy, now knocking two points off GDP every year; and that treats the Members of this institution with respect, with respect. Not excluding those who disagree, but putting us around the table, letting our voices be heard, letting us be constructive Members of this institution.                              {time}  1845  I would say to the leadership of this institution, treat the Members with respect. We were also elected.  I thank the gentleman for allowing me this time to speak in opposition.
