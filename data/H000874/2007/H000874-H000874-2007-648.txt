Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. There have been, I would tell the gentleman, some 22 hearings on Iraq by the Government Reform Committee, by the Armed Services Committee, by the International Relations Committee, by the Appropriations subcommittee and by the Committee on Intelligence. There have been extensive hearings on this bill. This is a resolution. It is being done in conjunction with the Armed Service Committee and the International Relations Committee. I do not anticipate that there will be a markup of the resolution.
