President, today marks an important anniversary in America's continuing efforts to create a truly just and more perfect Union. It was 50 years ago today--50 years--that nine courageous high school students in Little Rock, AR, stood up to a jeering, threatening crowd, the Arkansas National Guard, and their own Governor to claim their fundamental right for equal educational opportunity.  I can still recall as a child, seeing that scene on black-and-white television, a scene that has been replayed so many times, watching those students as they walked through that gauntlet of hate into a high school. High school, for most of us, was a joyous experience, a happy experience. For many of these students, their high school career began with fear.
