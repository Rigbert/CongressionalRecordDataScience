The gentleman indicated that Members should expect there will be votes in the House next Friday. That is Halloween. How certain is the gentleman that we are going to have votes on that day?  Mr. DeLAY. I am pretty certain we are going to have votes on that day. If Members look at the conference reports and the fact that the present continuing resolution runs out on that day, if things do not go as we expect them, we could have some very important legislation on that day, although we understand that it is Halloween and Members want to be home with their families and want to trick or treat. And hopefully even if we work on that day, we can let Members out in time to go trick or treating.
