Speaker, I rise in favor of impeachment.  Mr. Speaker, today I will join a majority of my colleagues in the House of Representatives and vote in favor of impeaching the 42nd President of the United States, William Jefferson Clinton. I did not reach this decision lightly. After reviewing the documents and articles of impeachment put forth by the House Committee on the Judiciary, I reached the unhappy but necessary conclusion that there is enough evidence to warrant forwarding these articles to the Senate. I do so with the best interests of California's 43rd congressional district, and all Americans, foremost in my mind.  We have heard from the other side of the aisle the constant plea for censure as an alternative to the vote today. I do not believe, however, that censure is an option for the House. The Framers of the Constitution did not provide for censure as an alternative to impeachment, therefore it would be irresponsible and unconstitutional to bring such a motion to the full House for consideration. The House has never censured a President before, and it would be a horrible precedent to set. It is the responsibility of the United States Senate to decide President Clinton's guilt or innocence and punishment.  The President has twice taken an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States. He also took an oath before a Federal grand jury to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. And then he broke both ofthese oaths. The President is the nation's chief law enforcement officer and is subject to the same rules and laws as every American. Without a clear and strong rule of law, the United States would be nothing more than a banana republic. Simply put, the evidence is clear that William Jefferson Clinton committed perjury and obstruction of justice while serving as the President. In the best interest of our nation, the rule of law should be upheld and this President should be impeached, and face trial in the Senate.
