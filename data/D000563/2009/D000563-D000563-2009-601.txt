Presdient, on July 20, 2009, we celebrated the 40th anniversary of the first time man set foot on the Moon. On that day 40 years ago, an estimated 500 million people around the world watched as the crew of Apollo 11, Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin, made history. It was a remarkable accomplishment, the magnitude of which has not diminished over the years.  As part of the anniversary festivities, Congress awarded John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth, and the crew of Apollo 11 the Congressional Gold Medal. I cosponsored the legislation and am pleased that they were recognized with it.  Most recently I had the chance to meet two Illinois astronauts, Scott Altman and John Grunsfeld, whom earlier this year successfully completed the last service mission of the Hubble Telescope. We will be able to explore even deeper into the mysteries of our universe for many years to come because of their incredible work.  Today, I wish to recognize Dr. John C. Houbolt, a scientist born and raised in Joliet, IL, who has received far less acclaim, but who deserves our Nation's gratitude for making the Moon landing possible.  One of the most important and hotly debated technical decisions during the Apollo Program was how to land on the Moon and return safely to Earth. Amid many ideas and obstacles, Dr. Houbolt recognized that the most efficient way to execute the Moon landing was with a lunar-orbit rendezvous plan.  His concept involved a mother craft that would orbit the Moon while a lighter craft descended from it to the surface of the Moon carrying some of the astronauts. Eventually, the smaller aircraft would lift off and rendezvous with the mother ship.  For many years NASA's leadership favored other concepts to reach the lunar surface. But, Dr. Houbolt's determination, persistence, and perseverance moved this innovative concept forward. As former NASA Deputy Director George Low noted, without Dr. Houbolt's efforts, NASA ``might not have chosen the Lunar Orbit Rendezvous Mode'' and ``had the Lunar Orbit Rendezvous Mode not been chosen, Apollo would not have succeeded.''  On the 40th anniversary of the lunar landing, as we celebrated with the crew of Apollo 11 in Washington, DC, a new exhibit aptly named ``The Soaring Achievements of John C. Houbolt'' opened at the Joliet Area Historical Museum. I encourage my fellow Illinoisans, especially students, to visit this exhibit.  Dr. Houbolt's inspiring story, like the stories of Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, Buzz Aldrin, and John Glenn, is a testament to what we can achieve with persistence and the passion to reach for new heights.                          ____________________
