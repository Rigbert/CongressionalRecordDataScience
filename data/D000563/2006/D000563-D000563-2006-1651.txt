He and I come from different parts of the political spectrum, and his life experience in business and otherwise is quite different from my own life experience. But I will tell you that I agree completely with your analysis. I think you have carefully looked at the impact of this pending bill on real-life companies, real-world companies, and there are clearly winners--and big winners--and losers--and big losers--in the course of creating this trust fund.  Without assigning any motive as to why some companies do so well and others do so poorly, I think what you have suggested as an alternative is the sensible middle ground. And the sensible middle ground, which I think will soon be offered by the Senator from Texas, is to look at successful efforts in States that have changed the whole environment on asbestos litigation.  I am looking to this amendment. I want to read it carefully before making any commitment on my part, but this seems to me to be the right move to make, to capitalize on the State efforts before we create a trust fund.  I would like to ask the Senator if he has any knowledge or personal experience with the creation of other trust funds in the past in an effort to solve problems like black lung, and even in the trust funds that were created by companies like Johns Manville, and whether the initial estimates of cost turned out to be accurate in the long run.
