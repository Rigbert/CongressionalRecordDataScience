President, I support the mission of AmeriCorps. I have met the people, young and old, participating in Vermont's program, and I have seen the benefits in their faces and in the benefits in their faces and in the communities they serve.  Engaging Americans of all ages to help communities solve their own problems is a worthy goal. AmeriCorps builds a sense of community responsibility and is certainly a better investment than the $1 billion this Congress plans to spend for each B-2 bomber.  The greatest threat facing our cities and towns today is the loss of a sense of community responsibility. The best weapon against rising crime, hunger, and illegitimacy is for every American to take an active interest in their community.  AmeriCorps provides inspiration by inviting Americans to give something back--to reestablish the local ties that have been so important to this country. I cannot think of a better program to invest Federal dollars in.  Senator Mikulski has been a tireless advocate of the AmeriCorps Program, which now has 20,000 participants from all different backgrounds. The accomplishments of those participants are evident everywhere.  The 130 AmeriCorps members in Vermont are fighting hunger and malnutrition, improving trails and wildlife habitat in the Green Mountain National Forest, and helping rural communities develop fire protection plans. Others are helping troubled youths get back on their feet and aiding the blind.  AmeriCorps is an experiment that is working. The least we can do is to allow that experiment to continue.   I urge my colleagues to support Senator Mikulski's amendment providing funding for the Corporation for National Service in 1996.
