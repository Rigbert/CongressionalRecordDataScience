President, last month the Food and Drug Administration issued new consumer guidance, warning pregnant women, women of childbearing age, nursing mothers, and young children not to eat shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish in order to avoid exposure to methylmercury. I commend the FDAfor issuing this guidance, which is important information for the most vulnerable members of our population. Unfortunately, despite acknowledging the problem of mercury contamination in large fish, the FDA still has not revised its so-called ``action level,'' which is important data for consumers and local governments, nor do they enforce this level. There is a lot more to be done to protect the public, and after so many years of delays, we should not wait any longer.  That is why Senator Harkin and I are introducing important legislation today to promote food safety and protect thousands of Americans, especially pregnant women and young children, from the serious risks of methylmercury. The ``Mercury-Safe Seafood Act of 2001'' requires the Food and Drug Administration to establish a formal tolerance for safe methylmercury levels in seafood. It mandates seafood testing to ensure compliance, along with public education and health advisories to inform the public.  Mercury is a dangerous poison that is still not fully regulated in the United States. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, coal-fired power plants, waste incinerators, and other sources spew 150 tons of mercury into the atmosphere each year. Although new and expected EPA rules address much of this pollution, full compliance and large emission reductions are still years away. Much of this mercury returns to earth with rain to pollute our waterways. It accumulates in fish as methylmercury, especially in large predatory species, and is passed on to the humans who eat these fish. Methylmercury is a powerful neurotoxin that affects the human central nervous system. It is especially harmful to pregnant women, infants, and young children, where even small doses can cause permanent damage to their developing brains and nervous systems.  Last year's comprehensive report by the National Academy of Sciences, ``Toxicological Effects of Methylmercury,'' estimates that 60,000 newborns each year may be at risk from prenatal mercury exposure. Two weeks ago, the Centers for Disease Control released preliminary results from an ongoing study showing that 10 percent of American women may have potentially hazardous levels of mercury. This means that a lot more newborns may be at risk. This is a public health problem we cannot ignore.  Certain commercial seafood species--large predators such as swordfish, shark, mackerel, and tuna--can have dangerously high levels of methylmercury contamination. Food and Drug Administration data throughout the 1990's showed numerous fish samples with high mercury levels, exceeding FDA's own action level and presenting a direct hazard to consumers. FDA stopped testing for mercury in 1998, which means they have no way to enforce their action level. Yet recent testing by independent organizations still shows high mercury levels in some fish species.  FDA's action level of 1.0 part per million was established in 1979 using information from the 1970's, without regard for the greater vulnerability of pregnant women, infants, and children. More recent studies have highlighted the damaging effects of mercury, especially for these populations. In 1997, EPA's ``Mercury Study Report to Congress'' recommended a level five times more strict than FDA's action level, and this was confirmed by last year's National Academy of Sciences report. FDA's current action level, even if there were sampling and enforcement, is not stringent enough to protect the most vulnerable American consumers from mercury.  Last month the General Accounting Office released a report on seafood safety, at the request of Senator Harkin and Senator Lugar. That report confirms that FDA has not acted vigorously enough to address the issue of mercury in seafood.  This bill seeks to remedy these problems. It amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require a tolerance level for methylmercury in seafood, with special attention to pregnant women, infants, and children. This will replace FDA's outdated and unenforced action level with a formal tolerance that must be enforced. It mandates ongoing sampling of mercury levels to ensure compliance. This will restart the testing which FDA stopped three years ago. It mandates public education and health advisories to ensure the public is aware of the new standards and of the risks of mercury contamination in seafood. It requires consideration of last year's National Academy of Sciences report, which clearly shows the need for prompt, strong action. Finally, it authorizes modest appropriations to support not only FDA's sampling and public education but also the efforts of our States to protect our citizens from methylmercury in freshwater fish.  I enjoy fishing and I love eating fish. This legislation is not meant to harm the fishing industry--it is meant to help bring the safest fish to market for the American consumer. Most importantly, this bill will protect pregnant women and young children who may now unknowingly be exposed to high levels of mercury. No one can dispute the science that tells us mercury is toxic and unsafe at certain levels in fish. We need to bring those levels down. But, until we do, we also need to keep the food supply safe for all Americans--especially those most at risk.  We have a responsibility to protect the American public, especially our children. Until such time as mercury emissions are drastically reduced and seafood is no longer contaminated, we must take this action to protect Americans from this dangerous pollutant..  The American Public Health Association has endorsed this bill.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows.                                 S. 555       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Mercury-Safe Seafood Act of      2001''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants, waste      incinerators, and other anthropogenic sources continues to      contaminate inland waterways and territorial waters of the      United States;       (2) mercury accumulates in fish as methylmercury and is      passed on to humans that eat those fish;       (3) methylmercury is a potent neurotoxin that, even in      small quantities--       (A) can cause serious damage to the human central nervous      system and adverse effects on many other systems in the human      body;       (B) is especially harmful to pregnant women and young      children; and       (C) puts an estimated 60,000 newborns at risk for adverse      neurodevelopmental effects each year in the United States      from in utero exposure;       (4) certain commercial seafood species can have dangerously      high levels of methylmercury, as evidenced by Food and Drug      Administration data acquired in the 1990's, up to the time      that the agency discontinued domestic sampling in 1998;       (5) the Food and Drug Administration's long-standing action      level of 1.0 parts per million for methylmercury in fish--       (A) is out of date; and       (B) according to scientific evidence, does not adequately      protect pregnant women and young children;       (6) the comprehensive Mercury Study Report to Congress      issued by the Environmental Protection Agency in December      1997 recommended a methylmercury consumption limit of 0.1      micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day, which is 5      times lower than the Food and Drug Administration's current      action level;       (7) the report entitled ``Toxicological Effects of      Methylmercury'', issued by the National Academy of Sciences      in July 2000, confirmed that the Environmental Protection      Agency's limit is ``scientifically justifiable for the      protection of public health'';       (8) the report entitled ``Food Safety: Federal Oversight of      Seafood Does Not Sufficiently Protect Consumers'', issued by      the General Accounting Office in February 2001, highlights      the inadequacies of Food and Drug Administration guidance      regarding methylmercury in commercial seafood;       (9) many States have been forced to issue mercury      advisories for inland waterways and health warnings regarding      the fish that may be caught in those waterways; and       (10) some States have also issued mercury advisories for      commercial seafood.
