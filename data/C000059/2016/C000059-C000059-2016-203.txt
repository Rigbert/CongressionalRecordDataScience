Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to southern California are exceptional. Mr. Bill Carnahan, who, for more than 16 years, has served with distinction as Executive Director of the Southern California Public Power Authority (SCPPA) will be retiring after 50 years of dedicated service to public utility.  Since he became Executive Director in 2000, Mr. Carnahan has succeeded in making SCPPA one of the largest and most active joint action agencies in the country, with a diverse energy resource portfolio. SCPPA represents 11 community-owned utilities and one irrigation district that provide electricity to 4.8 million people, over 7,000 square miles in Southern California. Mr. Carnahan has worked with Members of Congress throughout the West, from both sides of the aisle, to advance the interests of community-owned utilities. He is well known for his vision, his ability to bring stakeholders together, and his forthrightness. Bill has played a pivotal role in advocating on behalf of non-profit, publicly-accountable utilities that serve consumers in small and large communities alike.  Under Mr. Carnahan's leadership, SCPPA has grown immensely--evolving from six generation and transmission projects in its early days, to 32 generation and three transmission projects bringing power from Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Washington, Oregon, California and Nevada to Southern California today. Mr. Carnahan helped enact legislation to extend federal contracts which will ensure that Southern California consumers continue to enjoy emissions-free hydropower from Hoover Dam for another 50 years. Hoover power is a low-cost, reliable energy resource, and is critical to helping keep Southern California's energy costs as low as possible. The bill, the ``Hoover Power Allocation Act,'' was signed into law by President Barack Obama on December 10, 2011.  My personal and professional respect and admiration for Mr. Carnahan runs deep, and I wish him happiness and good health in his retirement. The wise counsel, determination, and good Scotch-Irish sense-of-humor, which he has provided to me and others in Congress for many years on behalf of public power--will be fondly remembered.                          ____________________
