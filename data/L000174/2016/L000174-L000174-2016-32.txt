If they were trying to get on television doing it, we might want to take a look at what they said. They said the Clinton Foundation should be dissolved, notwithstanding the amount of good work it is doing around the world. Every action, every meeting, every activity of the Clinton Foundation should be revealed, they said. We cannot allow such a foundation to run so close to the Oval Office, they said.  So it is ironic, sadly ironic, actually it is madly ironic, that since November 8, I have heard neither a shout nor a whisper from congressional Republicans echoing the same concerns about our President-elect's personal and profitable business dealings. No outrage that the President-elect's family may charge the American taxpayers millions of dollars to rent space for the Secret Service at Trump Tower. No demand that the President-elect--the chairman and president of The Trump Corporation--dissolve the interests he owns. Today we hear how the President-elect plans to address these conflicts of interest which he calls a ``visual'' problem rather than an ethical one. But unless he does what I and others have called for--divest his interest in and sever his relationship to the Trump Organization and put the proceeds in a true blind trust--it is nothing more than lipservice. Until we know more about what role his family will have, both in his business interests and the government's operation under a Trump administration, no one should consider this serious concern as addressed.  And here is the duplicity of congressional Republicans' double standard. After years of partisan witch hunts and millions of wasted taxpayer dollars investigating bogus allegations against Hillary Clinton, and by extension the Clinton Foundation, if they fail to demand the same of Donald Trump that they demanded of her, they will, as E.J. Dionne said so eloquently in his column in the Washington Post, ``be fully implicated in any Trump scandal that results from a shameful and partisan double standard.''  Madam President, I am hearing from Vermonters. They are worried. They are uncertain. Some of them are scared. Congress could do a great service to all our constituents if it led by example, not just by convenient spoken platitudes that might give you a few seconds on the evening news. If my colleagues want to actually be the leaders that they claim they are, do not start by validating an offensive and dangerous double standard. Have the same standard for Republicans as you do for Democrats. You can't condemn Democrats on something but say it is perfectly okay if Republicans do it. It doesn't work that way.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the column from the Washington Post of November 27, 2016, by E.J. Dionne entitled ``An ethical double standard for Trump--and the GOP?'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 27, 2016]           An Ethical Double Standard for Trump--and the GOP?                          (By E.J. Dionne Jr.)       Republicans are deeply concerned about ethics in government      and the vast potential for corruption stemming from conflicts      of interest. We know this because of the acute worries they      expressed over how these issues could have cast a shadow over      a Hillary Clinton presidency.       ``If Hillary Clinton wins this election and they don't shut      down the Clinton Foundation and come clean with all of its      past activities, then there's no telling the kind of      corruption that you might see out of the Clinton White      House,'' Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) told conservative talk show      host Hugh Hewitt.       Presumably Cotton will take the lead in advising Donald      Trump to ``shut down'' his business activities and ``come      clean'' on what came before. Surely Cotton wants to be      consistent.       The same must be true of Reince Priebus, the Republican      National Committee chair whom Trump tapped as his chief of      staff. ``When that 3 a.m. phone call comes, Americans deserve      to have a president on the line who is not compromised by      foreign donations,'' Priebus said earnestly in a statement on      Aug. 18.       Priebus, you would think, believes this even more strongly      about a president whose enterprises might reap direct profits      for himself or members of his family from foreign businesses      or governments. Priebus must     thus be hard at work right now on a plan for Trump to sell      off his assets.       ``The deals that she and her husband were pocketing--     hundreds of thousands of foreign money,'' Rep. Darrell Issa      (R-Calif.) told the Breitbart website, the right-wing outlet      once led by the soon-to-be White House chief strategist,      Stephen K. Bannon. Issa added that Clinton wanted her      activities ``to be behind closed doors'' and ``did that      because she doesn't know where the line is.''       We can assume that Issa will press the president-elect      about the dangers of doing business deals ``behind closed      doors'' and instruct him about where the ethical ``line''      should be.       And it would be truly heartening to know that Rep. Jason      Chaffetz (R-Utah), a vociferous critic of the Clinton      Foundation (``There's a connection between what the      foundation is doing and what the secretary of state's office      is doing''), plans to apply the same benchmarks to Trump.       After all, when the chairman of the House Oversight and      Government Reform Committee was asked last August on CNN if      Trump should release his tax returns, his answer was both      colorful and unequivocal. ``If you're going to run and try to      become the president of the United States,'' Chaffetz      replied, ``you're going to have to open up your kimono and      show everything, your tax returns, your medical records. You      are . . . just going to have to do that.''       I eagerly await Chaffetz's news conference reiterating his      kimono policy, since he made very clear that he sees his role      as nonpartisan. ``My job is not to be a cheerleader for the      president,'' he said. ``My job is to hold them accountable      and to provide that oversight. That's what we do.'' Early,      comprehensive hearings on the problems Trump's business      dealings would pose to his independence and trustworthiness      as our commander in chief would be a fine way to prove      Chaffetz meant this.       Republicans did an extraordinary job raising doubts about      Clinton--helped, we learned courtesy of The Post, by a      Russian disinformation campaign. Does the GOP want to cast      itself as a band of hypocrites who cared not at all about      ethics and were simply trying to win an election?                          ____________________
