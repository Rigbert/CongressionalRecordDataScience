 Over the last few years, consumer complaints had been made about offensive material being inserted in various consumer products. These offensive materials range from neo-Nazi and anti-Semitic hate messages to pornographic images and disturbing anti-abortion images. Unfortunately, these materials have been found in consumer products often used by children, such as cereal boxes. Moreover, such activities pose risks to the safety of consumer products, which consumers reasonably expect to obtain from the store in pristine condition and without those products having been opened by unauthorized individuals.  To address this problem, this legislation would add a new prohibition to the Federal Anti-Tampering Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec.  1365, to prohibit a person from intentionally tampering with a consumer product, without the consent of the manufacturer, retailer, or authorized distributor by inserting a writing in the consumer product or its container prior to its sale to a consumer. A person convicted of violating this new provision would be subject to a fine or up to two years' imprisonment. The term ``tamper'' is defined to mean meddling for the purpose of altering, damaging or misusing a product. See Webster's Dictionary. The bill describes in precise terms the tampering activity that would fall within the new criminal prohibition, and is intended to extend further protection to consumer products.                          ____________________
