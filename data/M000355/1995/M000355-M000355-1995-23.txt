 President, it is required by paragraph 4 of rule 35 that I place in the Congressional Record notices of Senate employees who participate in programs, the principal objective of which is educational, sponsored by a foreign government or a foreign educational or charitable organization involving travel to a foreign country paid for by that foreign government or organization.  The select committee received notification under rule 35 for William Triplett, a member of the staff of Senator Bennett, to participate in a program in the Philippines sponsored by the Rotary Club of Makati-Legazpi from December 2-8, l995.  The committee determined that no Federal statute or Senate rule would prohibit participation by Mr. Triplett in this program.                          ____________________
