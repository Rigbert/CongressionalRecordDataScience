 Madam Speaker, what we have heard from the other side of the aisle I think basically falls into the category of the perfect being the enemy of the good. When the perfect defeats the good, then bad prevails.  The way checks and balances were set up, it is really hard to pass a perfect bill. I think one has been passed since 1789 in this House of Representatives.  What we are doing at the end of the session is some good stuff. Criminal alien gangs and all of the other things that I described in my opening statements, I think they are good. If they are good, we ought to vote for them. If it isn't good to deal with criminal alien gangs that are poisoning and terrorizing our streets, then vote ``no.''  Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Forbes).
