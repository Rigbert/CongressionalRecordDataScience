Domestic propaganda? Propaganda to convince the elected officials of the people of the United States or the voters of the United States that some misbegotten objective will be good for the country? That's what you're talking about.  We're not talking about using intelligence or using our own auspices overseas, the Voice of America, whatever, to spread the voice of freedom and democracy around the world. But we are talking about deceiving the United States Congress and the voters of the United States of America in violation of the law, a law that was passed in reaction to the Soviet empire.  You are advocating the position of the Soviet Union in the 1950s, propaganda to deceive your own people. That is unbelievable to me on this floor.  Since the 1950s, since the height of the Soviet Union and the Cold War, we have prohibited propaganda directed at the people of the United States using taxpayer dollars by the Pentagon.  What happened here was a violation of that law, and that anybody would stand here on this floor and say that that law, which we have had in place for more than 50 years, should be repealed or undermined by one narrow-mined administration or Vice President Cheney or anybody else who wants to manipulate intelligence, the Congress and the American people into a war that should not have been initiated is unbelievable at this point in time.  An informed, free and fair press is critical to our system of government to have informed decision-makers here. Maybe you don't want to hear the truth, but I do, and to have informed voters who are voting based on the truth and choosing their elected representatives based on decisions that they fully understand and that they have been fully informed on and not propagandized.  It's extraordinary to me in the 21st century anybody would advocate the use of propaganda against the voters and the people of the United States.
