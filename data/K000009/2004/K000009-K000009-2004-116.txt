Speaker, this is a very important point, and I respect my dear colleague from California (Mr. Berman), but the facts are we are outsourcing patent review procedures from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. In other words, it is going to go to private companies, not the government of the United States, protected by what the Constitution demands. It is going to be outsourced to companies.  The question is what is a U.S. company? If we look into the law, a U.S. company operating within the boundaries of the United States, even if it is Honda Motor Corporation, is a U.S. company. Foreign corporations operating within the United States are defined as U.S. corporations because they operate within our soil.                              {time}  1630  But they are not U.S. corporations, because their profits are booked back to their home country. So I have a real problem with this.  Number one, we should not be outsourcing the jobs from the Patent Office. That is the most important line that we are breaching here. Never before in the history of this country has this been done. It has never been done. And then we are saying, well, you know, it will be a U.S. company. But then look to the law. How do we define what a U.S. company is? Any company operating within the boundaries of the United States? It could be Honda, it could be Toshiba, it could be Daemler, it could be any company.
