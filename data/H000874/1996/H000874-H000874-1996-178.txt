Chairman, this debate as we open consideration of the Treasury-Postal bill has centered on the Internal Revenue Service. We have done well by law enforcement, and I support them. We have done well by some other portions of the bill, and I am appreciative of the fact that we did not have the conflict which was political, in my opinion, last year with reference to the operations of the President of the United States, the White House, which we fund. I think that is appropriate in the comity between the legislative and executive branches.  Mr. Chairman, we have focused on IRS because it is central to the operations of government. We have come together as a people to perform certain functions. We argue about those functions. That is the purpose of this body and the body across the way, the Congress of the United States sent here to make determinations as to how this Government ought to be operated and what it ought to do.  In the process, we have taxed ourselves, we have said we will commit a certain portion of our resources to public efforts. All societies do that, and all societies have arguments about how much those taxes ought to be and what ought to be the purposes for which they are spent.  But I say to my colleagues, if you are a proponent of education, this bill puts your objective at risk. I say to my colleagues, if you are a proponent of the defense of this Nation, this bill puts that at risk. I say to my colleagues, if you are in favor of the Federal Bureau of Investigation having the resources to carry out its responsibilities to fight crime and make America a safer, better place in which to live, this bill puts that objective at risk.  Mr. Chairman, I will not catalog the endless number of priority projects and purposes in the 12 other appropriation bills which are overwhelmingly supported not only by the Members of this House but by the American public. But in order to accomplish those objectives, and I know my friend, the chairman, is a strong supporter of a strong defense. I supported, as he did, increasing substantially the dollars for defense over the President's budget. But if we are going to do that, if we are going to meet our responsibilities to this generation and generations yet to come, it will be because we fairly and efficiently and effectively collect revenues to accomplish those purposes.                              {time}  1815  This bill puts that at risk. That is not, as I said earlier, the gentleman from Maryland, Steny Hoyer, alone saying that. That is not Steny Hoyer who, like my colleagues from the Washington metropolitan area, represents a lot of the people who will be fired because of the lack of resources in this bill.  It is the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Archer], not perceived to be a liberal left-wing Democrat who wants to throw money at problems, saying that this bill will not work, this bill puts at risk deficit reduction, this bill does not allow the IRS to function as it is required to by law. That is the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Archer], and the chairwoman, the gentlewoman from Connecticut [Mrs. Johnson], speaking. I hope my colleagues will oppose this bill.
