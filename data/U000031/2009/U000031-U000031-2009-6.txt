Speaker, let's face it: the recent events have shown us that the current system regarding food safety is not working. And I want to compliment those Members that have been actively involved in this, those from our Committee on Oversight and Investigations that exposed many of the problems, obviously the leadership on both sides, Republicans and Democrats, as we moved this bill through our subcommittee and then full committee by a voice vote.  The Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee found severe problems. We are very aware of those problems because those problems have been exposed nationally. Obviously, we have a number of very bad actors, but they have jeopardized the whole food chain. We remember the peanut butter issue and spinach and tomatoes. We need to be deliberate to tackle the issue and obviously be bipartisan to resolve the issue, and that's what this legislation does.  As Mr. Shimkus indicated, farms are not required to register with the FDA. There are no large fees associated with this bill. There is no duplication with the USDA, as I understand it.  My district in southwest Michigan has a whole number of different food sources from fruits and vegetables to giant food processors and great companies like Kellogg's. Industry is united behind this legislation. It needs to happen so that consumers will know for sure that there is a mechanism in place to identify when a product, in fact, is bad, that needs to be recalled. And this bill, as it has moved through committee, has shown that bipartisan support.  I would urge my colleagues on both sides to support it.
