 President, we are about to have a voice vote on the substitute amendment, and I would not object to a voice vote, since I know we have all been here a long time, but I would just like to point out to everyone that the substitute amendment is a major bill that has just been introduced that we are now voting on. I assume everyone has read every word of it.  We have been debating 20 hours and just got a major amendment a few hours ago that doubles down on all of the deep and harmful bill that is in front of us, and it is really objectionable to those on our side that after 20 hours of debate on a number of amendments we get a major substitute amendment that we are voting on.  I would not object to it being a voice vote, but I urge my colleagues to vote no.  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield back the time on this side.
