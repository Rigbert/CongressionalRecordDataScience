President, this weekend, Marcelle and I will attend an event at the University of Minnesota Law School to honor the life and career of Vice President Walter Mondale on the occasion of his 80th birthday which he reached in January.   Vice President Mondale is a valued friend whom I proudly consider one of my mentors in the Senate. As I reviewed materials for this weekend, I came across an editorial by Vice President Mondale that appeared in the Washington Post on July 27, 2007 entitled ``Answering to No One.'' The editorial provides an excellent perspective on the Office of the Vice President and how that office evolved in recent history.   In order to remind all Senators and their staffs about this insightful article, I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the Congressional Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:                           Answering to No One                         (By Walter F. Mondale)        The Post's recent series on Dick Cheney's vice presidency      certainly got my attention. Having held that office myself      over a quarter-century ago, I have more than a passing      interest in its evolution from the backwater of American      politics to the second most powerful position in our      government. Almost all of that evolution, under presidents      and vice presidents of both parties, has been positive--until      now. Under George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, it has gone      seriously off track.        The Founders created the vice presidency as a      constitutional afterthought, solely to provide a president-     in-reserve should the need arise. The only duty they      specified was that the vice president should preside over the      Senate. The office languished in obscurity and irrelevance      for more than 150 years until Richard Nixon saw it as a      platform from which to seek the Republican presidential      nomination in 1960. That worked, and the office has been an      effective launching pad for aspiring candidates since.        But it wasn't until Jimmy Carter assumed the presidency      that the vice presidency took on a substantive role. Carter      saw the office as an underused asset and set out to make the      most of it. He gave me an office in the West Wing, unimpeded      access to him and to the flow of information, and specific      assignments at home and abroad. He asked me, as the only      other nationally elected official, to be his adviser and      partner on a range of issues.        Our relationship depended on trust, mutual respect and an      acknowledgement that there was only one agenda to be served--     the president's. Every Monday the two of us met privately for      lunch; we could, and did, talk candidly about virtually      anything. By the end of four years we had completed the      ``executivization'' of the vice presidency, ending two      centuries of confusion, derision and irrelevance surrounding      the office.        Subsequent administrations followed this pattern. George      H.W. Bush, Dan Quayle and Al Gore built their vice      presidencies after this model, allowing for their different      interests, experiences and capabilities as well as the needs      of the presidents they served.        This all changed in 2001, and especially after Sept. 11,      when Cheney set out to create a largely independent power      center in the office of the vice president. His was an      unprecedented attempt not only to shape administration policy      but, alarmingly, to limit the policy options sent to the      president. It is essential that a president know all the      relevant facts and viable options before making decisions,      yet Cheney has discarded the ``honest broker'' role he played      as President Gerald Ford's chief of staff.        Through his vast government experience, through the      friends he had been able to place in key positions and      through his considerable political skills, he has been      increasingly able to determine the answers to questions put      to the president--because he has been able to determine the      questions. It was Cheney who persuaded President Bush to sign      an order that denied access to any court by foreign terrorism      suspects and Cheney who determined that the Geneva      Conventions did not apply to enemy combatants captured in      Afghanistan and Iraq.        Rather than subject his views to an established (and      rational) vetting process, his practice has been to trust      only his immediate staff before taking ideas directly to the      president. Many of the ideas that Bush has subsequently      bought into have proved offensive to the values of the      Constitution and have been embarrassingly overturned by the      courts.        The corollary to Cheney's zealous embrace of secrecy is      his near total aversion to the notion of accountability. I've      never seen a former member of the House of Representatives      demonstrate such contempt for Congress--even when it was      controlled by his own party. His insistence on invoking      executive privilege to block virtually every congressional      request for information has been stupefying--it's almost as      if he denies the legitimacy of an equal branch of government.      Nor does he exhibit much respect for public opinion, which      amounts to indifference toward being held accountable by the      people who elected him.        Whatever authority a vice president has is derived from      the president under whom he     serves. There are no powers inherent in the office; they must      be delegated by the president. Somehow, not only has Cheney      been given vast authority by President Bush--including,      apparently, the entire intelligence portfolio--but he also      pursues his own agenda. The real question is why the      president allows this to happen.        Three decades ago we lived through another painful example      of a White House exceeding its authority, lying to the      American people, breaking the law and shrouding everything it      did in secrecy. Watergate wrenched the country, and our      constitutional system, like nothing before. We spent years      trying to identify and absorb the lessons of this great      excess. But here we are again.        Since the Carter administration left office, we have been      criticized for many things. Yet I remain enormously proud of      what we did in those four years, especially that we told the      truth, obeyed the law and kept the peace.                          ____________________
