Speaker, I thank the Majority Leader. Does the gentleman know at this point in time what type of rule, I notice that the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions) is on the floor, what type of rule the Homeland Security authorization bill might be considered under?  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay).  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) yielding. I have not been advised as to what kind of rule. I think the gentleman that is sitting here is about to make an announcement in that regard. I would assume that it would be handled like most major bills.  As the gentleman knows, the Homeland Security authorization bill is the first Homeland Security authorization bill that this House has considered, and so there is a lot of room for negotiation.
