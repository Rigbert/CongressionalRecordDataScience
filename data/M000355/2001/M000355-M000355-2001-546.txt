 I think he has come up with an amendment to bring some justice to that situation.  I am also curious if the Senator has thought about another value: That there will be one or more amendments dealing with that 26-year-old hard money contribution limit of $2,700.  Imagine the unknown candidate running in a State such as California against somebody who is either well known or well off. The Senator suggested it would be difficult to compete against such a person in New Mexico or Kentucky. I ask my friend whether he thinks there would be any chance in the world of a candidate running against a millionaire in a big State such as California.
