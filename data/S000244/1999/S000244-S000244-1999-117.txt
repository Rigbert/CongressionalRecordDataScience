Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher).  Mr. Chairman, there has been a lot of confusion relative to what the bill does in this area, and I would like to dwell on two points.  First of all, the manager's amendment that the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher) has introduced makes it clear that NASA will be able to continue research in the ultra efficient engine.                              {time}  1145  There is $50 million a year that is authorized for that. I think that that is a very wise move, because I do not think we should back away from this program altogether.  The second misconception that I am afraid is floating around here is that if NASA designates a program as a focus program, then that program is protected against raids by NASA or OMB or the Congress or anybody else to take the money away from a focus program and put it into something else. That is not the case.  OMB in the past has canceled focus programs and stuck the money into other NASA programs, and there have been reprogramming requests that have come up from the administrator and which have been approved either by the Congress by not acting or have been in transfer authority in appropriation bills.  The one that immediately comes to mind is the high speed research and advanced subsonic focus program which was in the aeronautics budget that NASA canceled and put the money in the International Space Station when the International Space Station ran short.  So I think that what is being done here is to continue the research but not to make it a focus program, and thus not to have what effectively is an earmark but an earmark without teeth.  Now having said all of that, one of the things that the science policy study attempts to do, which received overwhelming support on both sides of the aisle when it was approved last year, is to leverage government dollars with private sector dollars and dollars from other sources so that we have a bigger research pot, and that is what the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher) is trying to do in this program.  We do not have enough government money to do everything that we want to do, and the NASA administrator has criticized this bill for being above the President's request. What we would like to do is we would like to bring the private sector in, and it is the private sector that is going to be able to reap the financial rewards of a successful development of an ultra-efficient engine. To have the taxpayers pay for the entire cost of developing the ultra-efficient engine is going to give the private sector a free ride, let us face it.  So this is a way to bring about cost sharing, to bring about the fact that the private sector has to put their money where their benefits will flow, and I think is a very, very constructive step in the right direction to start this program out.
