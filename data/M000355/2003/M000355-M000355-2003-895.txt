 We ought to get rid of this Clinton Social Security tax. We ought to do a significant dividend exclusion that is, to the maximum extent possible, permitted under our overall ceiling in the growth package. And we ought to begin to address prescription drugs, which the leader has indicated we are going to do in June. If we do those three things, I would say we are well on the way to providing the kinds of relief for seniors--both on the tax side and on the prescription drug side--that they richly deserve, that we have talked about for entirely too long around here and have never done anything about.  So let me conclude by commending my friend and colleague from Kentucky for an excellent amendment. I hope it will be approved overwhelmingly. I thank him for his continuing contribution to this whole Social Security debate. The Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Bunning, was the chairman of the Social Security Subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee and is now on the Senate Finance Committee, and is one of the real experts on Social Security in America.  When Senator Bunning talks about Social Security, we all listen, and once again he has proposed an excellent idea which I fully support. I thank him and commend him for his outstanding work.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
