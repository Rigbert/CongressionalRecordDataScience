 Yet only two have been granted significant prominence to have their likeness stand on permanent display within the halls of the U.S. Capitol building.  The Great Compromiser, Henry Clay, is one of those who have earned such distinction. And the second statue recognizes the contributions of Dr. Ephraim McDowell to modern medicine. While his might not be a household name, Dr. McDowell's contribution to surgical procedure is nonetheless momentous, making him one of only two Kentuckians in history to be recognized in the Capitol.  It was 200 years ago that Dr. McDowell performed the world's first successful ovariotomy. What Mrs. Jane Todd Crawford of Green County, KY, mistook for twins, Dr. McDowell correctly diagnosed as a 22-pound ovarian tumor.  Mrs. Crawford begged Dr. McDowell to prevent her from dying a slow and painful death. The young doctor explained that her only option was to have experimental surgery, and he went further in explaining that none who had previously undergone such surgery had survived. Undeterred, Mrs. Crawford pressed Dr. McDowell to perform the surgery and made the 60-mile horseback ride to Danville, KY, on December 13, 1809.  By the end of the 25-minute procedure, which was performed without anesthetic, Mrs. Crawford's tumor had been removed and she was able to make an uncomplicated recovery. She would go on to live another 32 years. In time, Dr. McDowell would go on to perform nearly a dozen more such procedures, and his meticulous notes of performing a successful abdominal surgery would be reviewed and taught on two continents.  In those notes, he wrote about his first success:       Having never seen so large a substance extracted, nor heard      of an attempt, or success attending any operation such as      this required, I gave to the unhappy woman information of her      dangerous situation. The tumor appeared full in view, but was      so large we could not take it away entire. We took out      fifteen pounds of a dirty, gelatinous-looking substance.      After which we cut through the fallopian tube, and extracted      the sac, which weighed seven pounds and one-half. In five      days I visited her, and much to my astonishment found her      making up her bed.  Madam President, it is not just Mrs. Crawford who owes a debt of gratitude to Dr. Ephraim McDowell. Indeed, because of his efforts and courage, the entire field of medicine made great advancements and society as a whole is the better. With the bicentennial of this remarkable accomplishment soon approaching, I thought it fitting for us to take a moment and remember this man who Kentucky rightfully honors with a place in the U.S. Capitol.                          ____________________
