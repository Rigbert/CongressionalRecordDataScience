Chairman, I would be more than pleased to accept the gentleman's acceptance and to say that there could be no more important action of this government than dragging the U.S. Department of Agriculture into the 21st century, and helping America to become energy self-sufficient at last.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).  The amendment was agreed to.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Are there any further amendments?
