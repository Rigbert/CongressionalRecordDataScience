President, as an American citizen, public official, and former prosecutor, I am appalled at the news accounts I have seen of State, local, and Federal law enforcement officers getting together to wallow in racism. There is no room for racism in law enforcement. Law enforcement officers, in particular, have to be held to the highest standards of conduct. People have to know that they will be treated fairly by those who act on behalf of the Government and wield its power.  As we proceed with the Judiciary Committee hearing, I expect that we will hear a chorus of condemnation. I expect that we will hear each agency join in that refrain, explain that it is investigating the situation and that it will be taking appropriate action based on the facts. We should all act based on the facts. I look forward to the prompt completion of ongoing investigations and to our following up, when the facts are known.  It is tragic that racism is still a fact of life. It is most disconcerting if racism taints law enforcement actions. That is wholly unacceptable. I note that the reports of the activities at the recent Good Old Boys Roundup in Tennessee do not go that far, however--I have yet to hear any allegation that the official duties of the State, local, and Federal law enforcement agents who chose to attend the gathering were affected. That should be our first concern.  Next, we should be concerned whether Federal law enforcement resources were devoted to organizing or supporting these gatherings. The American people need to know that their tax dollars are not being diverted to such activities.  Further, we have to be concerned that our culture, and the culture in which these various law enforcement officers live and work, still abide these gatherings and displays.  As we consider whether additional steps, policies, regulations, or laws are needed to root out the evils of racism, we must be mindful that we not create political litmus tests or become thought police. We need to be sensitive to the limits of law and preserve some place for private lives and private thoughts.  We must also be careful to avoid being exploited by those with ulterior motives who oppose valid law enforcement. Our actions and those of the executive branch must be based on facts, not third-had news accounts.  Finally, we must not allow this shameful incident to taint the vast majority of fine and dedicated men and women who risk so much to protect us and the rule of law every day.                          ____________________
