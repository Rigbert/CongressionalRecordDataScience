 President, we are now on the floor considering the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill. This is an extremely important measure to everyone here and to the country, with important investments in our roads, bridges, highways, airports, housing, and infrastructure across the country. My ranking member, Senator Bond, and I are here ready to go and ready to work. We are waiting for our colleagues to come to the floor to offer their amendments, and I encourage them to do so.
