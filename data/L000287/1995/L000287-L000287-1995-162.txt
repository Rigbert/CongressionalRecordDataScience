Mr. Speaker, just a few days ago, many of us in the House came together on the House floor to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Voting Rights Campaign of 1965. Last week, I traveled to Selma, AL, along with several of my colleagues from the Congressional Black Caucus and thousands of others, in commemoration of the historic march from Selma to Montgomery, a turning point in the campaign for voting rights.  Today, I would like to take a moment to pay special tribute to one of the soldiers and leaders of the civil rights movement, someone who was with us on the 54-mile march from Selma to Montgomery, the Reverend Ralph David Abernathy, Jr. As many of us who participated in the movement join together to celebrate the achievements of the past and to remember those who marched alongside us many years ago, I believe this is a very fitting time to recognize the Reverend Abernathy. It is also Dr. Abernathy's birthday tomorrow. Dr. Abernathy was born in Marengo County, AL on March 11, 1926. He passed away, too young, 5 years ago. Tomorrow, he would have been 69.  The Reverend Ralph David Abernathy, Jr. had a lifelong commitment to securing and protecting basic civil rights for all Americans. He was a leader in the civil rights movement, a close friend of the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. I marched with him many times. After the assassination of Dr. King in 1968, Dr. Abernathy assumed leadership of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and worked with dedication and perseverance to carry on Dr. King's dream. After Dr. King's death, Dr. Abernathy continued to organize and lead marches and other events, including the Poor People's Campaign, a massive demonstration to protest unemployment, held in Washington, DC.  I believe we should take a moment to remember the people who brought us here today, to remember some of the sacrifices and the contributions of the many people who participated in the civil rights movement. Thousands of people participated. Some had small roles, others large roles. The Reverend Ralph David Abernathy had many roles, often at the same time. He was a teacher, a leader, an organizer, a soldier, and a friend. Today, we remember his spirit, his good humor and his guidance. One day before the date of his birth, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating his legacy and his life.                          ____________________
