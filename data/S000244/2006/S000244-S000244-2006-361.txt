Speaker, H.R. 6094 restores the Secretary of Homeland Security's authority to detain certain dangerous aliens, to ensure the removal of the deportable criminal aliens and to combat alien gang crime.  The legislation provides DHS authority to detain beyond 6 months aliens under orders of removal who cannot be removed in a number of situations, such as if an alien has a highly contagious disease, release would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences, release would threaten national security, or release would threaten the safety of the community and the alien is either an aggravated felon or is mentally ill and has committed a crime of violence.  The legislation also provides DHS with expedited procedures for the removal of inadmissible criminal aliens and provides new tools to prosecute criminal alien gang members.  The motion to recommit pertains to a subject matter different from that contained in the legislation under consideration. Specifically on page 2, line 18 of the motion to recommit, it increases the number of United States marshals.  United States marshals do not do immigration enforcement, and thus it expands the bill beyond the scope of the bill and is nongermane. And as a result, the motion fails the test of germaneness contained in clause 7 of rule XVI and thus is not in order.
