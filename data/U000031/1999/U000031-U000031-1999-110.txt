Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues, Representative Ed Towns and Representative Jo Ann Emerson, in introducing H.R. 1777, the Emergency Ambulance Services Assurance Act of 1999. This legislation will ensure that health care plans reimburse for emergency ambulance services when individuals had every reason to believe that they were experiencing an extremely serious condition requiring immediate emergency care.  Some may ask why we are introducing this legislation when all of the major managed care reform bills that have been introduced in Congress already include emergency care provisions. But the fact is, these bills cover only what happens when the patient enters the emergency room. None of the bills ensures coverage for emergency ambulance services. It is our hope to use this separate bill to highlight this omission and to build support for including emergency ambulance services coverage in more comprehensive managed care reform proposals that may be moving through the legislative process.  This legislation would ensure that individuals suffering what they had every reason to assume to be a potentially life-threatening condition requiring immediate medical attention or their family or caretakers don't have to phone their insurance plan before they call for an ambulance and don't have to worry about paying for the ambulance services should the condition later prove to be not as serious as the patient thought.                          ____________________
