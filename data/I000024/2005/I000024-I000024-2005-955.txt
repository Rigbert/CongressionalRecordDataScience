President, we are overdue getting on the highway bill. We are preparing right now to offer a substitute amendment. We are prepared to do that, but Senator Specter had said he wanted to speak for a period of time as in morning business. He has been planning to do that, and I will yield 15 minutes to him for that purpose.
