It sets up a pilot program for real ultra-high-speed Internet in rural areas. We are going to have this in urban areas. All we are saying is let rural areas--and every single Senator represents a rural area somewhere in their State--allow rural areas to compete with urban areas for jobs, for education, for medical care.  The ultra-high-speed Internet service pilot is narrow in scope, carefully drafted. I know it is supported by the distinguished chair and distinguished ranking member. It has the potential of bringing, as I said earlier, the innovation of Silicon Valley to the Upper Valley in Vermont and rural areas across the country.  It is almost what we had to argue about rural electricity back before I was born--whether rural areas would be the same as urban areas. This makes it possible.  I urge its passage.
