  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, as the Republican revolution patters on about the audit of the House of Representatives, the economy is crumbling around us. It is business as usual in Washington, DC, or, rather, as usual, big business and Wall Street are dictating that we continue our failed trade policies with the enthusiastic support of the new Speaker and the new majority.  We ran a record trade deficit in May. According to the Commerce Department, it was an $11.4 billion trade deficit. That means we exported 228,000 jobs to unfair trading partners around the world.  What does the new majority have to say about that? Well, precious little, because they are too busy filling their campaign coffers with special trips to Wall Street rather than addressing the failed trade policy. Yes, this administration, the Clinton administration, has followed Reagan and Bush in this failure. But the new majority is doing nothing to change it. We need a new trade policy for this country, a policy that brings jobs home to America and protects our economy.                          ____________________
