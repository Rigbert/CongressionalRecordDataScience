Mr. Speaker, I rise with sadness to inform the House of the passing late yesterday afternoon of one of the longest living former Members of the House, Peter H.B. Frelinghuysen. Congressman Frelinghuysen served in this House with effectiveness and distinction and honor between 1953 and 1975.  Peter Hood Ballantine Frelinghuysen was born in New York City in 1916. After graduating from Princeton University and then Yale School of Law, he served in the Office of Naval Intelligence during World War II. He was elected as a Republican to the 83rd Congress.  When he first entered Congress, he served on the Education and Labor Committee, and after that as ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in the early 1970s. After being elected to 10 successive terms in Congress, he retired in 1975.  Of course, all of my colleagues know that Peter's son, Rodney, our distinguished colleague here in the House, is now in mourning, as is the rest of the family. So on this sad day, I would invite all of my colleagues to join me in extending to Rodney and his brothers, Frederick and Peter, and his sisters, Beatrice and Adaline, and their families, our deepest and most profound condolences.  Peter Hood Ballantine Frelinghuysen was proud of his work in the House. He was loved by the people of New Jersey, and we thank him for his extraordinary legacy of service.                          ____________________
