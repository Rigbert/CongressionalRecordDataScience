We have a number of amendments I will just briefly describe.  There is one by Senator Helms on Venezuela, one by Senator McConnell and myself on development credit authority, another Leahy-McConnell amendment on MDB authorizations, a McConnell-Leahy amendment on documentation center, an amendment by Senator McConnell on nuclear safety, a Mikulski amendment on small business, and a Gordon Smith amendment on religious freedom. Also, there are two previously offered amendments by Senator Boxer; one is on Afghan reconstruction and one is on suicide bombings.  I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to send all the amendments to the desk; that they be considered to be in order; that they be considered en bloc, and they be adopted en bloc.
