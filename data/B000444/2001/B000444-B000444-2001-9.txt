 President, I rise to point out that while the attention of the world is now rightly focused on Afghanistan and the war against terrorism there, we should not forget that a large part of the oil and gas consumed by the United States and the rest of the industrialized world comes from the conflict-ridden Middle East.  In addition to addressing the issue of energy independence through new domestic sources of supply, conservation, and the development of renewable energy resources, it is imperative for us to be thinking abut the best possible way of protecting the security of alternative sources of oil and gas outside the United States. The Caspian Sea is also on Russia's doorstep, and we should encourage development that will foster positive political as well as economic relations with the world's second largest oil exporter.  Russia's recent refusal to follow OPEC's lead in slashing production is one more example of its ability to play a positive role on world oil markets, and the recently opened $2.5 billion Caspian oil pipeline, Russia's largest joint investment to date, and one in which U.S. firms hold more than a one-third interest, is an example of the kind of project that will encourage Moscow to continue to look westward.  Akezhan Kazhegeldin, an economist, businessman, and former prime minister of oil-rich Kazakhstan, has written a thoughtful article on these subjects that appeared in the Russianjournal Vremya Novostei on October 15, 2001. In his article, Dr. Kazhegeldin states that oil and gas from Kazakhstan and the other energy producing nations of the former Soviet Union could provide an important backup source of energy, complementing what now comes from the Persian Gulf countries.  Moreover, referring to the debate surrounding the route of future, additional pipelines carrying oil to consuming countries, Dr. Kazhegeldin asserts that there is no reason for the West and Russia to be at loggerheads now that the Cold War is over. He goes on to describe how the West and Russia could, in his view, work together on a comprehensive pipeline solution that would benefit everyone.  Some of Dr. Kazhegeldin's ideas will undoubtedly elicit healthy debate. I urge my colleagues to read his provocative article, and I ask that the text be printed in the Record.  The article follows.                 [From Vremya Novostei, Oct. 15, 2001]``Global Arc of Stability: The way Russia and the Caspian Can Make the                              World Stable''                        (By Akezhan Kazhegeldin)       The September 11 tragic events and launching of the Afghan      campaign, seen as the first stage in ``the global war against      terror'', have changed the world dramatically. Protection of      peaceful citizens from possible terror acts appears as just a      tip of the huge pyramid of new problems. We are facing an      acute and more global problem, the problem of ensuring the      industrial world's economic safety.       The supply of the developed nations' energy, above all, oil      and gas, is a critical and vulnerable element in the world's      economic relations. A great part of the developed oil fields      are concentrated in the highly insecure and conflict-ridden      Middle Eastern region, which makes the threat of oil blockade      and energy crisis for the industrial countries, the main oil      and gas consumers, a perpetual nightmare. Unpredictable      dictators are no less dangerous than terrorist groups. Should      the interests of both in the region coincide, the rest of the      world would find itself in an impasse.       Even if everything goes very well and the antiterrorist      campaign ends quickly, the community of industrial countries      will have to make sure that the threat of energy blackmail is      ruled out in principle. In the global energy system, it is      necessary to use reserve and back-up methods in order to      ensure safety. Caspian oil reserves can play a major role      here.       For the past decade, politicians and journalists have been      debating about the problem of Caspian oil perhaps more      heatedly than the industry professionals. It has almost been      made into a stake in the new Great Game, the U.S-Russian      rivalry over the control of the region and its riches. This      confrontation has become the legacy of the old ``bloc'' model      of the world. Wayne Merry, a former U.S. State Department and      Pentagon official, now a senior associate at the American      Foreign Policy Council in Washington, describes its sources:      ``. . . Washington concentrated its efforts on one great      strategic project to assure US primacy in the region. . . .      The idea was to bypass existing pipelines in Russia, squeeze      out Iran, bring energy supplies from the Caspian region to a      transhipment point in a NATO country, and thereby assure the      independent futures of the producing and transit countries.''       Understandably, Moscow clearly saw the threat to its      interests and resisted U.S. plans. However, both sides played      their parts by force of habit, without their usual passion.      The reason is that the interests of Russia and the West (not      only the U.S.) in the region are actually not conflicting.      Some regional leaders tried to artificially keep alive the      conflict between them as they hoped to secure foreign support      for their authoritarian regimes.       Now that many old patterns have been left behind in the      20th century for good, the common interests of the industrial      and democratic countries allow them to work out joint      approaches to ensure their energy independence. Owing to      this, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan have a historic      opportunity to become stable partners of both Russia and the      West, and to be integrated into the world economy.       Naturally, this integration should entail bringing their      political systems in line with the international democratic      and market economy standards. ``A glance at other post-     colonial regions in Africa and Asia shows that the first      generation of `Big Man' leaders often does as much harm to      their countries as did the departing imperial powers,      creating a painful legacy for future generations to sort      out,'' concludes Wayne Merry. ``American long-term interests      in Central Asia are best served by seeking to engage      tomorrow's leaders and assuring that, when the region's      energy reserves do become important to the outside world,      these leaders will look to the United States as a friend and      not as yet another external exploiter.''       Setting aside the controversial definition of the Central      Asian countries as post-colonial ones, one should admit that      the time when the region's energy reserves do become      important to the outside world is nearing. Though geological      exploration of the Caspian shelf is far from being completed,      and many experts are not inclined to share the fanciful      expectations of ``dozens of new Kuwaits'', it is clear that      the region's oil and gas reserves are extremely large.      However, energy projects can't become global automatically,      thanks only to rich oilfields. Stable export routes are      required to deliver oil and gas to the global markets. Even      all the reserves of the Caspian states put together won't      make the Caspian project global. It is necessary to select      and develop the routes to transport oil and gas to the      global markets--to the consumers in Europe, U.S., and      Asian countries.       The most politically and economically viable option is to      transport the Caspian ``big oil'' up to the north, into      Russia and further on into Eastern and Western Europe, to the      consumers and transshipment ports. Economically, this option      seems much more attractive, since the construction is to take      place on a plain, in populated areas with a developed      infrastructure. Russia's European region has enough qualified      manpower and electricity for oil pumping. Russian plants      produce pipes and other equipment. Stability in Russia and      the neighboring countries guarantees safety of the route and      its uninterrupted operation.       If chosen, the Russian option would mean turning the energy      flow from south to north. It will permit the in-depth      integration of Russia and Central Asia into a united Europe      and simultaneously charge Europe and Russia with a common      political mission of ensuring energy independence for the      industrial countries. It will allow oil-producing countries      of the Caspian region to play a major role in the global      energy market. Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and--in the      long term, Turkmenistan, could, along with the North Sea oil      producing countries, become a real alternative to OPEC and      get significant political benefits.       The main advantage of the northern export route for Caspian      oil consists in the availability of a branched pipeline      network in Russia. It is much easier and cheaper to improve      and develop the existing system than to construct a new one.      I mean the pipelines owned by the Transneft company and the      recently constructed CPC line from Western Kazakhstan to the      Black Sea. The CPC alone cannot provide exporters with access      to the global market. For natural reasons, the Bosporus and      Dardanelles have a limited carrying capacity. The Black Sea      ecosystem is vulnerable, as this sea is warm and almost      closed. Turkey has already announced its intention to limit      the number of giant tankers passing through its straits.      Instead of forcing Turkey to agree by means of political      pressure, we should respect its fundamental interests and      seek other solutions in addition to the CPC capacities.       The pipeline would enable Russia to solve several of its      specific problems. For instance, to strengthen the special      status of the Kaliningrad region as Russia's outpost in      Western Europe. If the pipeline goes via the Kaliningrad      region, the region could not only solve some of its economic      problems, but also get additional security guarantees in case      of NATO's expansion to the East. A place of its own in the EU      economy would be the best guarantee for the region.       In any case, with any combination of routes, Russia would      be the main player in a Caspian-European project. Moreover,      Russia should initiate its realization. Technological and      economic calculations will give optimal solutions. However,      political will and vision are still primary considerations.      History teaches us that it is they rather than mathematical      and economic calculations that have brought into existence      such giant projects as the Suez and Panama Canals that formed      the global markets of those days.       Looking into the future and putting aside the required      political decisions, I would like to stress that the Russian      route could give an incredibly promising opportunity of      opening up global markets for Eurasian oil and gas. This      opportunity includes building an oil-carrier port in the      Murmansk region on the Barents Sea. The non-freezing, deep-     sea port would become the gateway to the global market for      Caspian, Siberian and, prospectively, for Timanoperchersk oil      as well, as the northern oil will require outlets to world      markets. In the Murmansk region, some former military ports      can reportedly be used right now by tankers. From there, they      can quickly and safely reach not only Western European ports,      but also the U.S. and Canada's eastern coast.       If gas-liquefying installations are built there, it would      be hard to imagine a more natural route for a pipeline which      will transport gas from the Russian polar regions and the      Arctic Ocean's shelf.       In addition to the oil pipeline, a parallel gas pipeline      should be built to provide Kazakh and Turkmen gas access to      global markets that will not compete with the existing      Russian gas routes to Western Europe. Constructing gas and      oil pipelines simultaneously will make it possible to      significantly cut capital expenditures and make      transportation for long distances economically viable. By the      way, the length of this route can be compared to the gas      export line running from Tyumen's north to Western Europe.       Today's situation on the gas market is such that the      Central Asian countries will long sit on their riches waiting      for investors hindered by the lack of access to global      markets. I am speaking not only about the     Turkmen gas. The share of gas in the Caspian hydrocarbon      reserves can be much higher than those suggested by the most      optimistic forecasts. On the one hand, Caspian gas should be      available when the industrial world needs it badly. On the      other hand, Caspian gas won't be a rival for Russian gas and      a source of contention between Russia and its neighbors in      Central Asia.       Where the two huge pipelines run side by side, where a      joint exploitation system exists, one will naturally expect      to have a transcontinental highway and info-highway--a      powerful communication line originating from Europe and going      further to the south.       These prospects are both exciting and distant. However,      they should be taken into account when addressing today's      problems. No doubt, the global economy does have enough      investment resources for such a large-scale project. The U.S.      Congress has given $40 billion for primary measures to      safeguard national security. Much less investment is needed      to ensure energy security of the industrial states.      Especially as it is much more reasonable and profitable to      invest in crisis prevention than in recovering from them.       A pipeline bridge between the Caspian region and Western      Europe, Central Asia and the world's oceans will help solve      the problem of the globalization of Eurasian energy      resources. It could become a basis for an ``arc of      stability'' in Europe. It not only shifts the so-called arc      of tension running close to Russia from the Balkans via the      Caucasus, Central Asia, Iran, and Afghanistan, but will also      exclude the Caspian states--the critical link--from this      chain. When involved in the global economy, these countries      could turn into strongholds of stability in a part of Asia      that today poses major threats to the world.                          ____________________
