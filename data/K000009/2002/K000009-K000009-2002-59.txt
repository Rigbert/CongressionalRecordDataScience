Speaker, this week the House was scheduled to take up a measure relating to fast track trade authority but, for some reason, it got pulled from the schedule and we were not told why. We know President Bush has called fast track one of his top legislative priorities, even though it will lead to more lost jobs and even higher trade deficits for our country. So it is a bit of a mystery why we did not take up this important measure.  Mr. Speaker, the President wants fast track to pave the way for the so-called Free Trade Agreement of the Americas, a kind of super NAFTA. This super NAFTA would extend NAFTA provisions to all of the countries in our hemisphere except Cuba. But why would we want a super NAFTA, considering the damage that NAFTA has caused in the past 8 years? NAFTA has been like a tornado, ripping up jobs and tearing apart communities from the textile areas of the Carolinas to the agricultural valleys in California and Florida, to the automobile industry in the Great Lakes region.  Now, according to the Los Angeles Times, the latest of our exports are high-wage jobs. Before NAFTA, we had a trade surplus with Mexico. We sent them more than they sent us. In 1993, in fact, before NAFTA, America held a surplus of over $6 billion with Mexico. Yes, that was a surplus. Where are we today post-NAFTA? Well, we had a trade deficit, a record deficit of nearly $30 billion with Mexico in one year; that is billion, translated into over 600,000 more lost jobs in our country.  Do we think the balance of accounts was any better with Canada? Wrong. Our trade deficit with Canada for the year 2001 was over $50 billion. That translates into 1 million less jobs in our country.  Who can call this kind of policy a success? Most estimates indicate that more than 3 million jobs, direct and related, have been lost post-NAFTA. Analysis shows State-by-State job loss figures range from a low of 6,838 in North Dakota to a high of over 364,000 in California. Other hard-hit States include my own of Ohio, but add Texas, New York, California, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Illinois, Tennessee, Florida, Indiana, Georgia, New Jersey, each with a loss of over 100,000 good jobs. Those may sound like numbers to the White House or some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, but each one of those numbers is a family fighting to put food on the table, to pay for college and medical costs, and is a strong indicator as well of America's waning manufacturing and agricultural strength. If that is the wave of the future, I sure do not want any part of it.  Under the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas, the ``Super NAFTA,'' instead of just covering Mexico and Canada, now we are going to add 31 more countries into the mix, like Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. In the first 3 months of this year alone, we already had a trade deficit with those countries of $6 billion. So why would anyone want to exacerbate a situation which is already working against the interests of our people?  This appears to be what the administration is fighting for: more lost jobs, more trade deficits. When will this job hemorrhage end? When we have no manufacturing base to speak of? When our markets are flooded with agricultural products from every place else in the world?  Mr. Speaker, many of our working families are suffering. In fact, millions of them are. America is becoming a bazaar to the world's goods and, at the same time, we are hollowing out our own productive strength here at home. It is no surprise to us here to tell the American people that 75 cents of every farm dollar today is Federal subsidy.                              {time}  1500  Farmers are farming the government, not the market. Our agricultural policies are only working to hold the farm credit system together so we do not have a depression in rural America, and in manufacturing America we have had a depression. I do not know why it is not on the front pages of every newspaper in the country. We have lost over 2 million jobs, more in the last 2 years. Talk to anybody in the integrated steel industry. Talk to anybody in the machine tool industry. Talk to the electronics industry.  It seems to me we ought to have trade policies that work for America again. We should not be trading away our good jobs, and fast track is not a responsible plan for a secure economic future. Why should we have a fast track for more lost jobs and higher trade deficits?  Someone ought to pay attention, and we ought to reject any fast track proposal that is brought to this floor.                          ____________________
