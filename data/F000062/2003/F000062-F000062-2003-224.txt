 President, I rise today with Senators Daschle, Dodd, Lieberman, Bingaman, Johnson, Feingold and Lincoln to introduce legislation to require the President to report to Congress on his vision for a democratic, economically viable, and politically stable Iraq, his plan for achieving those goals, and an estimate on how much this is going to cost.  After months of dodging questions, giving half-answers, and ignoring Congressional requests, the time has come for this Administration to level with the American people and Congress and spell-out its plan for rebuilding a country torn apart by years of dictatorial rule, ethnic strife, war, and terror.  Our legislation requires the President within 60 days of the enactment of this act to report to Congress on: the current economic, political, and military situation in Iraq including the number, type and location of attacks on U.S. and Coalition military and civilian personnel in the previous 60 days; a discussion of the measures taken to protect U.S. troops serving in Iraq; a detailed plan for the establishment of civil, economic and political security in Iraq, including the restoration of basic services such as water and electricity and the construction of schools, roads, and medical clinics in Iraq; the current and projected monetary costs incurred by the United States, by Iraq, and by the international community; actions takenand to be taken by the Administration to secure increased international participation in peacekeeping forces and in the economic and political reconstruction of Iraq; a detailed time-frame and specific steps to be taken for the restoration of self-government to the Iraqi people; cost estimates for achieving those goals; and U.S. and international military personnel requirements for achieving those goals.  I am pleased that, as Secretary of State Colin Powell announced last week, the Administration has finally decided to seek an additional United Nations Security Council Resolution authorizing increased U.N. participation in multinational peacekeeping forces and the political and economic reconstruction of Iraq.  Nevertheless, President Bush waited far too long to seek additional help and, as a result, we will face an ever greater challenge in rebuilding Iraq in the months and years ahead. And this past Sunday, President Bush announced his intention to seek an additional $87 billion to fund reconstruction efforts and military and intelligence operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.  What we need now is a plan on how to rebuild Iraq, an estimate on how much it is going to cost, what personnel, both military and civilian, U.S. and international, will be needed, and what the end game will look like.  Our troops, along with our British and Australian allies, performed brilliantly in executing Operation Iraqi Freedom. Their unmatched skill, bravery, and professionalism made us all proud. They overthrew a tyrannical regime in three weeks and, for the first time in over thirty years, brought hope to millions of Iraqis. We owe them a tremendous debt of gratitude.  But I believe United States troops assumed too great a burden in terms of manpower and exposure to risk, and will be forced to remain in Iraq longer than expected and at a higher financial cost.  Let us look at the facts.  Sixty-seven Americans have died in hostile action since the President declared an end to major combat operations on May 1, 2003. In total, 286 U.S. troops have died in Iraq, 146 since May 1.  One hundred and thirty-nine thousand U.S. troops are currently serving in Iraq, comprising 85 percent of coalition forces.  Four car bombings in the past month have killed 121 people, including the UN's top envoy to Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello.  Earlier this year, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld stated that the United States is spending approximately $4 billion a month in Iraq and, given the President's statement Sunday, there is no indication that this figure will go down anytime in the near future.  These are enormous commitments, and yet, we do not have a clear indication from the Administration about its intentions in Iraq. And that is why I am introducing this legislation.  We have assumed an enormous responsibility in Iraq and we must stay the course. But let us hear from the Administration on how it intends to stay that course and where that course will lead us. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1594       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Although President George W. Bush declared an end to      major combat operations in Iraq on May 1, 2003, as of early      September 2003, conditions in parts of Iraq continue to be      unstable, and President Bush has not yet provided Congress      with a detailed plan that outlines the strategic objectives      of Operation Iraqi Freedom, explains how and when the      President plans to accomplish these objectives, and estimates      the costs to be borne by United State taxpayers and the      international community.       (2) On September 7, 2003, President Bush announced his      intention to seek an additional $87,000,000,000 to fund      reconstruction efforts and military and intelligence      operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere.     SEC. 2. REPORT.       Not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of      this Act, the President shall submit to Congress a report      setting forth--       (1) a description of the economic, political, and military      situation in Iraq, including the number, type, and location      of attacks on United States and other Coalition military and      civilian personnel in the preceding 60 days;       (2) a discussion of the measures taken to protect United      States troops serving in Iraq;       (3) a detailed plan for achieving the goal of establishing      civil, economic, and political security in Iraq, including      the restoration of basic services such as water and      electricity and the construction of schools, roads, and      medical clinics;       (4) the monetary costs currently incurred and projected to      be incurred by the United States, the United Nations, Iraq,      and the international community;       (5) the actions taken and to be taken by the President to      secure increased international participation in peacekeeping      efforts and in the economic and political reconstruction of      Iraq;       (6) a detailed schedule and specific steps for achieving      the goal of restoring self-government to the Iraqi people;      and       (7) United States and international military and civilian      personnel requirements.                                 ______                                       By
