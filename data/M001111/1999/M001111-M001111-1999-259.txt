 President, let me conclude by letting my colleagues know that under current law today, a woman who volunteers to serve all of us, to protect all of us and our rights, when she goes overseas to serve us and finds herself in a situation where she requires an abortion, which is a legal procedure guaranteed by the Constitution in this country, has to go to her commanding officer and request permission to come home to the United States, flying home on a C-17, or a helicopter when one is available, to have a procedure that women here in this country who have not volunteered to serve overseas have at their disposal.  We are asking a lot of these young women. We should at least provide them the opportunity, as we do under my amendment, to pay for that procedure in a military hospital, where it will be safe, at their own expense. That is the least we should be offering them.  In a few moments we will be voting on this amendment. My colleague from New Hampshire has said the vote is close. Every vote will count. There is no doubt about it. So when you cast your vote today, ask yourself if women who serve us overseas to defend our rights should be asked to give up their rights when they get on that plane and they are sent overseas.  This is an issue which sends a message to all young people today that when they serve us in the military to protect our rights, we are going to be here to defend their rights as well. I urge my colleagues to vote against the motion to table.  How much time do I have remaining?
