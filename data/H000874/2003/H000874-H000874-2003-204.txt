Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I would urge the gentleman, and I know he may not have control over this, but urge him to urge his leadership, of which he is a member, as well as the Committee on Rules, to give us an open rule so that this bill, which is an extraordinarily important bill to our country, be fully debated and the alternatives that Members would like to offer can be considered. I would hope that he can work in that vein.  The Medicare prescription drug legislation, when does the gentleman expect the conferees will have a substantive meeting to seriously start resolving their differences, and might we see a conference report prior to the August recess?
