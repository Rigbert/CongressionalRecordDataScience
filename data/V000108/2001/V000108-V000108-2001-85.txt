Speaker, it is my distinct honor to congratulate some of the most dedicated and skilled workers in Northwest Indiana. On November 2, 2001, in a salute to their workers' durability and longevity, the Sheet Metal Workers Local #20, of Gary, Indiana, will honor their members with fifty, forty, and twenty-five years of continued service. These individuals, in addition to the other Local #20 members who have served Northwest Indiana so diligently for such a long time, are a testament to the proto-typical American worker: loyal, dedicated, and hard-working.  The men and women of Local #20 are a fine representation of America's working families. I am proud to represent such dedicated men and women in Congress. The Sheet Metal Workers Constitution states, ``. . . to establish and maintain desirable working conditions and thus provide for themselves and their families that measure of comfort, happiness and security to which every citizen is entitled in return for his labor, from a deep sense of pride in our trade, to give a fair day's work for a fair day's pay.'' For fifty years, the following individuals have followed this creed: Robert Molnar, Eugene Rucker, and Leland Thompson, In 1961, Donald Odell and Gerard Wardell began their own forty years of membership in the Sheet Metal Workers trade union. In addition to the great service and dedication displayed by the fifty and forty-year Sheet Metal Workers Local #20 members, the individuals with twenty-five years of continued service that will be honored include: Bruce Bassett, Richard Beres, Michael R. Birky, Randall Bohn, George Fedorchak, Joseph P. Lain, Nancy Fields, James P. Fredianelli, Jeffrey R. McClelland, Paul Popa, Jay K. Potesta, Mark E. Williams, and James A. Zimmer. I would also like to congratulate those individuals that graduated from the Residential Apprentice program. These individuals include: William Aicher, Jason Atwood, Brian Bajda, Daniel Elkins, Daniel Geeding, Timothy Howard, Richard Mann, Rober McGuire, David Mostello, Daniel Nelson, Shawn Novak, Mark Rehtorik, and William Wolfe.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating these dedicated, upstanding members of the Sheet Metal Workers Local #20 for their hard work in fulfilling the ``American Dream.'' I offer my heartfelt congratulations to these individuals, as they have worked arduously to make this dream possible for others. They have proven themselves to be distinguished advocates for the labor movement, and they have made Northwest Indiana a better place in which to live and work.                          ____________________
