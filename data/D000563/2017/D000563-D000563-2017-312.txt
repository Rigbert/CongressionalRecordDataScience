President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of Judge Amul Thapar to serve on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.  Judge Thapar is President Trump's first nominee to serve on a Federal appeals court. Last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee considered this nomination and no Democrat voted for it.  Judge Thapar is on the list of 21 candidates that the Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation have selected for President Donald Trump to choose from when filling Supreme Court vacancies.  Judge Thapar is well known to the Federalist Society. He was a member of that organization prior to becoming a district court judge, and since he became a judge he has spoken at Federalist Society events 17 times.  Some of my colleagues on the Republican side are like Captain Renault in Casablanca, who claimed he was ``shocked, shocked'' to find out there was gambling going on in Rick's Cafe.
