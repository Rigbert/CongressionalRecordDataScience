Speaker, I rise tonight to talk about Social Security, the premier program of the last century, which has helped to raise a generation of our seniors out of poverty. Most seniors in America receive upwards of perhaps $580 per month. For them it is a lifeline, and without Social Security and Medicare, they simply could not survive.  Today this House debated what to do with the estate tax, some call it a death tax, but assets accumulated by very large interests, and we heard the debate. But what is important to point out about this debate is that because the Bush administration and its allies inside this Chamber cannot afford to pay for the tax benefits being given, especially to the very super-rich in our country, they have raided the Social Security trust fund consistently this fiscal year, and, as of this week, June 5 and counting, they have taken from the Social Security trust fund already $207,232,876,712.  This chart and those that will follow in the weeks to come will clock the Republican raid on Social Security. The amount that has been taken to date averages thus far $717 per American citizen, and the numbers are still being counted as the days tick on.  As long as Republicans continue to raid the Social Security trust fund in violation of the promises not to raid the trust fund dollars contained in what was called an accounting lockbox, it is my intention to be here on the floor clocking their raid with our Social Security debt clock.  I also will be going through the history of who created Social Security for our country and who has historically opposed it. In fact, in 1935 in the deliberations in the Committee on Ways and Means not far from this floor, the Republican Members of the House Committee on Ways and Means voted to kill the original bill that created the Social Security program that our parents and grandparents and great-grandparents have benefited from since the mid-1930s.  When the bill moved to the floor, it was Democrats that passed that bill. I think it is very important that that history go on record, because if you look at what has been happening with the accumulation of additional debt in our country, and I put this chart up here as illustrative, we look at the accumulation of debt, this goes back to President Johnson. For a long time, because of the Vietnam War, and going into the Carter years, the recessions that resulted from rising oil prices, and then into the Reagan-Bush years when we had the huge defense buildup and the Persian Gulf War, our Nation went deeply into the red. We have over $6 trillion of debt that we are now financing in this country. But during the Clinton years, with the budgets that were passed in cooperation with this Congress, we were able to move to a point where we were actually, for the first time in modern history, accumulating surpluses, until now, with the inauguration of President Bush, and we are beginning to move into a deficit position again, and very severely so, in a very short period of time.  The funds that are available to borrow against for various purposes, whether it is giving tax cuts to people like Ken Lay, who will get over $350 million additional in a tax refund because of the tax bill passed earlier this year, or the estate tax that was voted here today, that money has to come from somewhere, and that somewhere is the lockbox that almost every single Member here voted to protect. It is beyond my imagination why anyone would want to vote in that manner.                              {time}  1800  But until this administration and House Republicans put seniors first and reverse this raid and commit to saving Social Security as we have promised, I will be here to tell the truth to the American people, using these red numbers and this debt clock to show just how much is being raided.  Today in the Washington Post there is a story called ``The State of the Estate Tax.'' I will enter it into the Record, but what is really interesting about this is it talks about some of the major beneficiaries of the bill that passed here by a very thin margin this afternoon. The very people that are raiding Social Security are taking care of some of their best friends. Here is one of them. Gary Winnick of Global Crossing fame, with assets of nearly 3 quarters of a billion dollars, will probably yield $366 million in so-called estate tax savings. Dennis Kozlowski from Tyco International, which has run into a little difficulty, $149 million.  Though my time has expired for this evening, all I have to say is the Democratic Party historically has been the party that has believed in and supported Social Security. We do not support borrowing from the trust fund in order to give tax benefits to the super rich.  More on this story later.  The information mentioned earlier follows:                [From the Washington Post, June 6, 2002]                      The State of the Estate Tax       The House begins debate today on President Bush's proposal      to make permanent last year's elimination of the estate tax,      or ``death tax'' as Republicans call it. Bush will be in Des      Moines on Friday to tout the effort, which would benefit      family farmers. Apparently, eliminating the tax would also      benefit some non-farmers--some of them in the Bush      administration.       Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.) asked his staff to assemble      a chart estimating just how much more the heirs of Bush, Vice      President Cheney and members of the Cabinet would get if the      estate tax were permanently eliminated. Waxman's aides also      applied their calculators on the balance sheets of former      Enron executives and the executives of other companies in the      news.       The winners? Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld's heirs      could gain as much as $120     million from the repeal, with heirs of Treasury Secretary      Paul H. O'Neill getting as much as $51 million more and heirs      of Cheney getting up to $40 million more. Heirs of Enron's      Kenneth L. Lay would get $59 million more. Bush, a relative      pauper, would leave behind an extra sum of no more than $10      million if the tax were eliminated.       The White House said Waxman's analysis was beside the      point.       ``Failure to make the tax cuts permanent would increase the      taxes on 104 million Americans,'' Bush spokeswoman Claire      Buchan said. ``The president thinks that's wrong and that      it's wrong to double-tax families, especially at the time of      death.''----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                    Assets                    Estimated estate tax savings----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bush Administration Official:    President Bush.....................  $11.1 million-$21.6 million.  $4.6 million-$9.9 million.
