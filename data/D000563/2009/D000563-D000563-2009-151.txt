President, I hope the Senator from South Carolina won't leave. He would not yield for a question. I want to address his remarks, and some of them are not accurate. I don't want him to feel that I am saying this outside of his presence.  I ask the Senator from South Carolina, while he has a few minutes, if he could look in the bill and find the provision in the bill that kills the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program. Please present it to me now, because it is not there. It is not there.  The DC Opportunity Scholarship Program is a voucher program, created more than 5 years ago. It was authorized through the Appropriations Committee, not through formal authorization. As many as 1,700 students in DC ended up going to school and getting about $7,500 a year to help pay the tuition for their schools. The program has diminished in size--I will concede that--even though I tried in a debate and negotiations to change that. It is down to about 1,300 students. It is funded in this bill to the tune of $13.2 million.  So for the Senator from South Carolina to stand up and say, as he did, that this program is killed, how does he explain the $13.2 million in the bill?  Mr. DeMINT. If the Senator will yield, the President has said he is going to end this program.
