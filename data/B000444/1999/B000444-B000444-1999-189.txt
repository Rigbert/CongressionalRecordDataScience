 Coleman could have helped him a great deal in his attitude with a little enlightenment in spiritual matters.  I think Hannibal could have used the Reverend back in the time of Mark Twain. It might have been a little bit different. I love Mark Twain, but he was a little wry. And I just want everyone to know I recognize the irony of the guest Chaplain being from Hannibal, MO, the home of Mark Twain.
