 President, today I wish to give tribute to a Kentuckian who has become a local icon and a national celebrity. Jordan Smith from Harlan, KY, has risen to fame over the past few months for his astounding performances throughout this season of the television show The Voice. He sang his way into the hearts of Americans, and following his rendition of Queen's ``Somebody to Love'' on December 16, the show's viewers voted him to a first place win.  I know I speak for my fellow Kentuckians when I say we are so proud to have someone like Jordan representing our State. This proud Kentucky Wildcat fan not only clinched a first place win in the competition, he also rose to a No. 1 spot on iTunes for record sales, beating out superstars like Adele. I think we have so many talented individuals like Jordan in Kentucky, and I am so glad that everyone else thinks so, too.  A homecoming parade in Jordan's honor is scheduled for Monday, December 21, in his hometown. Kentucky is excited to welcome him home and even more so to see what he will do with his amazing talent in the future. I would like to congratulate Jordan Smith for all his success. I am certain we will be hearing much more from him in the years to come.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article about Jordan's historic win from the Harlan Daily Enterprise be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           [From the Harlan Daily Enterprise, Dec. 15, 2015]                     Smith Is Season 9 Voice Winner                        (By Reina P. Cunningham)       After months of show-stopping performances, Harlan native      Jordan Smith has been announced as Season 9 winner of the hit      reality television show `The Voice,' winning $100,000 and a      recording contract with Republic Records.       Going into the show, Smith was sitting pretty at the No. 1      spots on both `The Voice' and the Top 100 iTunes charts with      his most recent single, `Mary Did You Know.' Sitting at the      No. 1 spot is nothing new for the young man who beat out      national singing     sensation Adele for the No. 1 spot on the Top 100 iTunes      chart--he has entered most of the results rounds in the same      situation. Additionally, going into the live results finale,      Smith held half of the top 10 spots on `The Voice' iTunes      charts and had 10 singles ranking on `The Voice' chart--no      easy feat considering the criteria for doing so means the      single must be ranked on the Top 200 iTunes chart.       In addition to performing with former contestants from this      season, Smith performed with former Voice coach and world      renowned singer Usher on Tuesday night's live results show.      The duo sang Usher's hit `Without You' with the crowd      screaming and cheering throughout the performance as Smith      showcased his broad range.       Throughout the show, Smith has remained humble as the      judges continue to remark on his flawless performances,      citing his perfection and ability to connect with the      audience.       The judges are not the only ones raving about Smith. Fans      are posting on social media about how much the young artist      has inspired them through his music. In addition to      purchasing iTunes and making social media posts, fans cannot      get enough of Smith's performances. As of the finale show on      Tuesday, Smith's YouTube performances on the show had an      outstanding 55 million views to date.       Smith spoke about what the experience has meant to him in      an interview that aired during the live finale. The young      singer, who continuously stressed how important it is to him      to make it acceptable to be who you are, echoed those      sentiments again during the interview, saying if he won the      show it would prove it.       ``You can be exactly who you are . . . to be the winner of      The Voice would just prove that,'' said Smith.       Later in the show, the top 4 performers were surprised with      brand new vehicles--courtesy of the show's partners, Nissan.       Smith chose the Nissan Altima and expressed his gratitude      for the vehicle, saying he would not have to borrow his      parents' car anymore.       Smith was the only remaining contestant on coach Adam      Levine's team and the coach was obviously thrilled for the      young man who he says has inspired him throughout the show.       Smith will be making appearances on numerous upcoming      television shows as a result of the win.       A homecoming celebration is planned on Monday in Smith's      honor. A parade will begin at 2:30 p.m. in downtown Harlan      followed by a program at 4 p.m. at the Harlan Center.
