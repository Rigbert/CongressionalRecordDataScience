 President, as I stated earlier, the Bennet amendment, as written, does not protect Medicare. So I have a modification I would like to present that ensures Medicare savings in this bill are not being siphoned off to finance a new and separate entitlement program.  To that end, I ask unanimous consent to modify the amendment by adding the following before the period at the end of subsection (b):       . . . and furthermore that, notwithstanding any other      provision of this Act or amendment made by this Act, net      Medicare savings specified in the most recent estimate      available from the Director of the Congressional Budget      Office before enactment are appropriated to the Secretary and      shall be used for such purposes and to maintain Medicare      policies for home health services, skilled nursing facility      services, hospice care, hospital services, and benefits      provided by the Medicare Advantage program, as under the      provisions of such Title as specified on the day before the      date of enactment of this Act.  End of my amendment.
