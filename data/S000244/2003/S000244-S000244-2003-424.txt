Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I am happy to support the gentleman's amendment. I think it makes a useful addition to this legislation. Basically it extends the types of protections that are contained in the bill to credit unions. I think that this plugs a loophole. I hope that his amendment is approved.
