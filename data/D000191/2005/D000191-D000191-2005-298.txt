Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds. I have worked closely with my colleague from Florida and always enjoy working with him. I would be happy to go for a trillion dollars in this bill. And I think we could spend that money wisely and make the country more competitive. I can guarantee him, if we could get to a trillion dollars, we could get him back 99 cents or maybe even a dollar on a dollar.  So I am hopeful that as we move through the process we can increase the amount of money, which will allow us to accommodate States like Florida and others who need investments just like everyone else in this country.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).
