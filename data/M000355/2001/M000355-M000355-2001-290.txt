 President, I sum it up, this is an amendment about the taxpayer funding of congressional elections, about as unpopular with the American people as voting for congressional pay raises. We have the most extensive poll ever taken on any issue on this subject every April 15 when our taxpayers in this country get an opportunity to divert $3 of the taxes they already owe into a fund to pay for the Presidential election and for the conventions.
