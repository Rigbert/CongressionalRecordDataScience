 President, I wish to honor two remarkable Iowans. Kay and Mary Kramer of Clive, IA have served their local community, our great State of Iowa, and America well. They have set an example of civic service that all people should be proud to follow.  Mary has a distinguished record of service to our country. She was the U.S. Ambassador to Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean. Additionally, she served on the White House Commission on Presidential Scholars, honoring outstanding high school seniors each year for both their academic and artistic achievements.  Mary has also served her home State of Iowa well. She has done this through her work in the Iowa Senate where she was elected and reelected for more than a decade. While serving in the senate, Mary was chosen by her fellow senators to be President of the senate. Her election to this position of leadership is a testament to the respect Mary has earned from those who know her best.  Mary and her husband Kay make a great, civically-minded team. Kay was named as a West Des Moines Citizen of the Year and is an active volunteer in his community. He served on the West Des Moines Board of Human Services and is still active as an officer with the West Des Moines Rotary Club.  I am proud to call Kay and Mary Kramer friends, and I am happy to honor both of them here today. I appreciate their tireless efforts to serve Iowa and America. I hope that their good work, and lifetime of service, does not stop any time soon.                          ____________________
