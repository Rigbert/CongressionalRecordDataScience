President, today we confirmed three nominations for high level positions in the Department of Justice. The Senate is moving forward to confirm the nomination of Gregory Katsas to be Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division at the Department of Justice. This is a nomination that was set to be confirmed before the Easter recess until it was blocked by a last-minute, anonymous Republican hold and additional complications in our relationship with the Department of Justice arose. We have made sufficient progress to move forward today.  We also confirmed today two additional nominations, Kelly H. Rankin to be U.S. Attorney for the District of Wyoming and Clyde R. Cook to be U.S. Marshal for the Eastern District of North Carolina. Those are among the many presidential nominations that we have expedited through the Judiciary Committee. They were considered and reported by the Committee yesterday and being confirmed today.  With the confirmations today, we will have confirmed 35 executive nominations so far this Congress, including the confirmations of 12 U.S. attorneys, 7 U.S. marshals, and the top 3 positions at the Justice Department. When the President and Senate Republicans play to rightwing special interests with constant complaints about judicial nominations, they ignore the progress we have made to restock the leadership ranks at the Department of Justice that were decimated by the scandals of the Gonzales era.  Of course, the grumblings on judicial nominations from the other side of the aisle are nothing more than partisan, election-year rhetoric that rings particularly hollow in light of the progress we have made. With the 5 nominations for lifetime appointments to the Federal bench confirmed this week by the Senate, including 2 for circuit court vacancies, the Senate under Democratic leadership has already, before the Fourth of July recess, matched the total of 54 judicial confirmations reached in 2 full years of the last Congress. That was a Congress with a Republican chairman and Republican majority working to confirm the nominees of a Republican President. And we have already matched their total.  The 14 judicial confirmations so far this year compare to the zero registered by a Republican led Senate bythis juncture during the 1996 session, another presidential election year.  The fact that Senate Democrats have moved more of President Bush's nominees more quickly when we have been in the majority than the Republicans did working with a President of their own party have is nothing new, just unacknowledged. We confirmed 100 nominations in only 17 months in 2001 and 2002, while working with a most uncooperative White House, reducing the judicial vacancies I confronted when I became Judiciary Committee chairman in the summer of 2001 by 45 percent by the end of 2002. The 40 additional judicial nominations we confirmed when I became chairman, again, last year was more than in any of the previous 3 years with a Republican majority and Republican chairman.  It is ironic that the Senate's Republican minority is so focused on the number of judges, because the reduction in judicial vacancies is the one number that has improved during the Bush administration in an era of skyrocketing gas prices, unemployment, health care costs and deficits and plummeting consumer confidence and home values.  On July 1, 2000, when a Republican Senate majority was considering the judicial nominees of a Democratic President in a presidential election year, there were 60 judicial vacancies. Twenty-one were circuit court vacancies. Those vacancies were the result of years of Republican pocket filibusters of judicial nominations. In stark contrast, after the 2 nominations we confirmed yesterday and the circuit court judges we confirmed on Tuesday, there are just 40 total judicial vacancies throughout the country, with only 9 circuit court vacancies. By confirming Judge Helene White and Ray Kethledge to the last two vacancies on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, we reduced circuit court vacancies to single digits for the first time in decades--nine vacancies on our Nation's 13 circuit courts.  The Judiciary Committee and the Senate have continued to make progress filling judicial vacancies even while having to devote extensive time and attention to rebuilding the Department of Justice. At the beginning of this Congress, the Judiciary Committee began its oversight efforts. Over the next 9 months, our efforts revealed a Department of Justice gone awry. The leadership crisis came more and more into view as Senator Specter and I led a bipartisan group of concerned Senators to consider the U.S. attorney firing scandal, a confrontation over the legality of the administration's warrantless wiretapping program, the untoward political influence of the White House at the Department of Justice, and the secret legal memos excusing all manner of excess and subverting the rule of law.  What our efforts exposed was a crisis of leadership that took a heavy toll on the tradition of independence that has long guided the Justice Department and provided it with safe harbor from political interference. It shook the confidence of the American people. Through bipartisan efforts among those from both sides of the aisle who care about Federal law enforcement and the Department of Justice, we joined together to press for accountability. That resulted in a change in leadership at the Department, with the resignations of the Attorney General and many high-ranking Department officials.  This week's troubling report from the Department's inspector general confirms what our oversight efforts in this Congress have uncovered about the politicization of hiring practices at the Department. It confirms our findings and our fears that the same senior Department officials involved with the firing of U.S. attorneys were injecting improper political motives into the process of hiring young attorneys. I suspect further reports from the inspector general will continue to shed light on the extent to which the Bush administration has allowed politics to affect--and infect--the Department's priorities, from law enforcement to the operation of the crucial Civil Rights Division to the Department's hiring practices.  This report and those to follow will serve as a reminder to future Presidents that never again should blatant partisanship be made the crux of the Justice Department's hiring practices. The Department of Justice is not the President's legal defense team. It houses our Nation's top law enforcement officers, and it has been crippled in the last 7 years. By beginning the first real oversight efforts of this administration, we have uncovered troubling truths about this administration's efforts to infuse partisan politics into our Nation's top law enforcement agency.  The oversight efforts did not complete our work. Asy result of the mass resignations at the Justice Department in the wake of the scandals, the committee held seven hearings on highranking replacements to restock and restore the leadership of the Department of Justice between September of last year up through the spring, including confirmation hearings for the new Attorney General, the new Deputy Attorney General, the new Associate Attorney General, and so many others. I thank Senator Whitehouse for chairing the hearings on the Katsas nomination. Today we continue that progress by confirming another nominee for an important leadership position at the Department.  It is vital that we ensure that we have a functioning, independent Justice Department, and that we ensure that this sad era in the history of the Department is not repeated. We have seen what happens when the rule of law plays second fiddle to a President's agenda and the partisan desires of political operatives and it is a disaster for the American people. Both the President and the Nation are best served by a Justice Department that provides sound advice and takes responsible action, without regard to political considerations--not one that develops legalistic loopholes and ideological litmus tests to serve the ends of a particular administration.  I congratulate the nominees and their families on their confirmations today.                          ____________________
