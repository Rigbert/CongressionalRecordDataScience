. 642, a bill to re-authorize the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Chesapeake Bay Estuarine Resources Office.  This bill, which I am proud to be a co-sponsor of, will undertake two new activities that I think will further improve the condition of the Chesapeake Bay. First, it provides $6 Million a year through 2006 for a small watershed grant program. This program will make it possible for local governments and environmental organizations, like the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, to undertake locally led restoration projects. They can use this money for such things as oyster and sea grass restoration projects, the creation of artificial reefs, and the improvement of fish passageways.  Second, it requires NOAA, in cooperation with State resource agencies and the scientific community to undertake a five year study to develop a multi-species management strategy. Let me give you an example of one of things they will investigate. Recently we have seen rockfish population, that was once on the brink of collapse, return. That is good news for the Bay and the watermen who now able to again fish for rockfish. The bad news is that the return of the rockfish may be a contributing factor to the decline of the blue crab stocks in the Chesapeake Bay.  The rockfish is a voracious predator that feeds on blue crab hatchlings. These hatchlings, who often lack sufficient habitat due to a loss of sea grass, are easy prey and are not surviving to breeding age. As we work to restore the Bay we need to develop a strategy that preserve and protect the delicate balance of this ecosystem. This study will give us the baseline information we need to rehabilitate one species without harming another.  The preservation of the Chesapeake Bay is a crucial investment that benefits all Americans. My thanks go to Mr. Gilchrest, Mr. Cardin, Mrs. Morella, Mr. Cummings, and Mr. Wynn for their leadership on this issue.                          ____________________
