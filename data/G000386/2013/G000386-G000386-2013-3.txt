 President, like my colleagues, and as I have done several times before, I come to the floor to share the voice of one of many Iowans who have contacted me over the sticker shock that they are experiencing under the Affordable Care Act. This time I quote a constituent from Sioux County, IA, northwest Iowa. That constituent writes:       I am a pastor in rural Iowa and early this past summer,      trusting naively in the integrity of our President's repeated      promise that ``If you like your health insurance you can keep      it. Period[,]'' I made a change in my policy, moving to a      higher deductible to save the church money. Now I have been      informed that because of that change, my policy is no longer      grandfathered and therefore I will be forced out of it in a      year and compelled to purchase a much more expense      (un)Affordable Care Act-compliant policy.       I am young, male, healthy, and will not qualify for any      subsidy. In effect, because of legislation Democrats      supported, my government is kicking me off from health      coverage that I carefully researched, chose and like a lot--     and is forcing me to buy coverage that I do not need at a      price I scarcely can afford.       And the Government has the audacity to resort to Orwellian      doublespeak and call such a draconian policy the ``Affordable      Care Act.''       Please convey to your Democratic colleagues that I grew up      on a dairy farm and now pastor a church of farmers. I am the      epitome of middle class America that they claim to champion.       This bill is unjust. It is based on lies to Americans like      myself. It hurts real people, including the church I serve.  I have done my job. I have shared this constituent's message with my colleagues as he asked me to do. I hope they were listening.  I yield the floor.
