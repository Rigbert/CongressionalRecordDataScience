President, let me again thank Chairman Inhofe. I, too, will comment that the collaboration and cooperation was superb in the committee. A great deal of that was the result of his work, and, as I mentioned before, the inspiration of Chairman McCain.  Mr. President, I join the Senator from Oklahoma to rise and discuss the fiscal year 2019 national defense authorization bill, which passed out of the Armed Services Committee on May 23 with a very strong bipartisan vote.  First, I would like to recognize Chairman McCain, after whom this bill was named. Senator McCain has guided this committee through several NDAAs with a steady hand and unyielding leadership. His commitment to a bipartisan process has been an example of the way Congress should function, and I am pleased to say this bill, again, follows in that tradition.  I also want to thank Senator Inhofe, who has ably and graciously led the committee this year through many hearings and an extremely efficient markup, which produced the bipartisan bill we are beginning to consider. We would like to have begun considering it and taking amendments today, but we will consider it, we will pass it, and we will continue the outstanding record of annually passing a national defense act for the men and women in the Armed Forces.
