 President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the Energy and Water Subcommittee for his leadership and willingness to settle issues to get this bill to the point where it really is ready to be voted on by this body. I think he has made the argument against the Cotton amendment eloquently and correctly. I am very grateful for the fact that he did what I think is a noble thing and changed his vote and will be voting against the Cotton amendment.  Let me say something about this process. Both the chairman and I have been here for a long time, and we were here when appropriations bills were passed. The key to doing that is keeping poison pills off appropriations bills so they can be passed quickly. In addition to the arguments made by the chairman, the White House had very strong feelings and indicated they would veto this bill if it passed with this amendment. How do we start an appropriations process with a Presidential veto in the wings? I don't think we do. Hopefully, the appropriate thing will happen in this vote, and cloture will be defeated. I hope that it sends a signal--a strong signal--for the rest of the appropriations process. We want to show that we can run this place and get business done and poisons pills have no place on appropriations bills. That is my very deep belief, and that is where it once was.  Once again, I thank the chair for his help, cooperation, and leadership. It is quite wonderful to be able to work with the Senator from Tennessee, Senator Alexander, and I too urge a ``no'' vote on cloture.                             Cloture Motion
