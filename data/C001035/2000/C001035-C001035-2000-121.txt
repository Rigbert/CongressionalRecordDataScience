President, breast cancer is second only to lung cancer as a cause of cancer-related deaths among American women. This year, an estimated 182,800 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed and 40,800 women will die of this terrible disease. In addition, an estimated 12,800 new cases of cervical cancer will be diagnosed this year, and 4,600 American women will die of this disease. Many of these deaths could be avoided by making sure that cancer detection and treatment services are readily available to all women at risk.  Early detection is currently the best way to combat breast and cervical cancer. If women age 50 and over obtain regular screening for breast cancer, up to 30 percent of breast cancer deaths could be prevented. Moreover, virtually all cervical cancer deaths could be prevented through regular screening.  In recognition of the value of screening and early detection, Congress passed the Breast and Cervical Cancer Mortality Prevention Act of 1990, which established the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. This important program has provided over two million screening tests to low-income and underserved women in all 50 States since its inception, and over 6,000 cases of breast cancer and over 500 cases of invasive cervical cancer have been diagnosed. In Maine, more than 8,300 women have been screened and 28 cases of breast cancer and 12 cases of cervical cancer have been detected through this program.  As one Maine woman observed:       This screening program was an answered prayer. I had been      concerned about having to skip checkups lately, but there was      no way to come up with the money anytime soon. I will gladly      tell all of my friends about this and will gladly return for      follow-up.  The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program has provided cancer screening services to more than one million low-income American women who, like the woman from Maine, otherwise might not have been able to have these critically important tests. Unfortunately, however, the program does not currently pay for treatment services for women with abnormal screening results. Since the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program is targeted to low-income women, many do not have health insurance and many more are underinsured. While States participating in the program have been diligent and creative in finding treatment services for these women, a study done for CDC found that, while treatment was eventually found for almost all of the women screened, some women did not get treated at all, some refused treatment, and some experienced delay.  Screening must be coupled with treatment if it is to save lives. As we approach the 10th anniversary of the enactment of the Breast and Cervical Cancer Mortality Act, it is time for Congress to complete what it started by enacting legislation to ensure that women diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer through the screening program will have coverage for their treatment. That is why I am pleased to be a cosponsor of S. 662, the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act, which would give States the option of providing Medicaid coverage for the duration of breast and cervical cancer treatment to eligible women who were screened and diagnosed through the CDC program. This legislation is not a mandate for States. It simply lets States know that, if they do decide to provide treatment services for these women, the Federal Government will be there to help with an enhanced Federal Medicaid match for these services.  Mr. President, S. 662 has strong bipartisan support with 66 Senate cosponsors. Moreover, last month the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed similar legislation. I want to commend the Senate Finance Committee chairman and the Senate majority leader for making a commitment to move this legislation this year, and I urge them to schedule committee action and Senate floor time soon so that S. 662 can be signed into law this summer. There would be no better way to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program in August than by enacting this important bill to provide the treatment necessary to save the lives of the women who are screened and diagnosed with cancer through this program.                          ____________________
