  Mr. President, this is a very important issue to virtually every urban community. For California, the cuts to Medicaid DSH payments means a loss of over $184 million a year. At Fresno Valley Hospital alone this cut is worth $6 million a year. We have had a number of our hospitals close, due in part to cuts to disproportionate share payments.  I want to particularly thank the Senator from Massachusetts, and the manager of the bill, the chairman of the committee, and the ranking member for their commitment to take this matter up on the Medicare bill. I look forward to working with them to fix this important program.
