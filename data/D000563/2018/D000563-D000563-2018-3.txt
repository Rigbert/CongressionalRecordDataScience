President, I would like to take a moment to thank a remarkable woman whose commitment to justice has helped more people in my State and in our Nation than she will probably ever know.  Her name is Cathy Hurwit. For the last 20 years, she has served as chief of staff to my friend from Chicago, Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky.  Cathy Hurwit is retiring from public service at the end of this year. This week, as she was packing up her office in the Rayburn building, a coworker happened to see her pull a photo from a drawer and pack it away with her books and files. It was a signed photo of Cathy with President Barack Obama.  That small incident tells you a lot about Cathy Hurwit. You see, for Cathy, public service has never been about personal gain. She has no use for ``vanity walls'' covered with photos of herself with powerful people.  Where others might hang a photo of themselves with a President, Cathy Hurwit hangs a poster from a rally to save Social Security and Medicare. For her, public service has always been about helping others and making our government better and fairer.  Cathy Hurwit is an icon in the progressive movement. She is committed to her values, and she is a genius at organizing and legislating. She knows how to use power to help others, whether in the minority or majority.  She didn't set out to work on Capitol Hill. Her first job after college was working as an AmeriCorps VISTA volunteer, helping migrant laborers in Utah.  She went back to school to earn a master's in journalism. After her first year, she was hired as a summer intern by Congressman Toby Moffett. She never went back to ``J school.''  She worked as Congressman Moffett's energy policy director for 3 years.  She then worked as adviser to the Subcommittee on Environment, Energy, and Natural Resources of the House Government Operations Committee, followed by 2 years as legislative director for then-Congressman, now Senator, Ed Markey.  Cathy left Capitol Hill to become legislative director for Citizen Action, a coalition of progressive organizations, from 1988 to 1997. After that came 2 years as legislative director and healthcare policy expert for the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, one of the great public employee unions in our country.  Cathy had vowed never to return to Capitol Hill. Thank goodness, Congresswoman Schakowsky persuaded her to change her mind.  Few people know more than Cathy Hurwit about the complexities of healthcare policy or about the consequences of the healthcare policy decisions we make in Congress for ordinary people. If you are among the millions of Americans who are grateful that insurers can no longer deny you coverage or charge you astronomically more for health insurance because of a preexisting medical condition, you can thank Cathy Hurwit. She was fighting for a Patients' Bill of Rights more than 20 years ago. With Congresswoman Schakowsky and others, she helped to include that and other essential protections in the Affordable Care Act.  Her work has improved the lives of millions of Americans.  While Cathy is leaving the Hill, she is not leaving the fight. I hope that she will find a little more time to enjoy a good show at the Kennedy Center. I know that she will continue to be a force for social justice.                          ____________________
