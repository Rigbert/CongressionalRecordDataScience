It could not have been done without Senator Daschle and Senator Reid and the leadership of my colleagues who have joined me. I also say it could not have been done without having such good, strong issues the American people support, that we can come talk about on the floor each day, pointing out that in this session of Congress they have not been addressed.  I thank the Senator for his kind words.
