 President, I rise today, along with Senator Boxer, to introduce legislation that would name a postal facility in Los Angeles, California after the great Los Angeles Laker's announcer, Francis Dayle ``Chick'' Hearn.  Chick Hearn was born on November 27, 1916, in Buda, IL.  His interest in broadcasting began when he worked for the Armed Forces Radio, while he was stationed in the Philippines during World War II.  Soon after he was discharged, he began announcing Bradley University basketball games for a radio station in Peoria, IL.  Mr. Hearn's desire to work in radio broadcasting soon led him to Southern California, where he worked for CBS radio announcing University of Southern California football games.  Then, in 1961, Chick Hearn began announcing Lakers' game when the franchise moved from Minnesota to Los Angeles.  His contributions to the game go far beyond giving the fans the play-by-play. Mr. Hearn pioneered basketball phrases, such as ``airball'' and ``slam dunk'' and ``finger role'' which are now well known and often used by Americans who participate or have an interest in basketball.  Perhaps the most distinguished characteristic of Chick Hearn's career is his extraordinary dedication to his work. Beginning on November 21, 1965, Mr. Hearn announced a record 3,338 consecutive games for the Los Angeles Lakers.  This streak ended on December 16, 2001, three days before Mr. Hearn underwent heart surgery. Until his death on August 5, 2002, Hearn had been the only play-by-play announcer the Los Angeles Lakers had ever had.  During his distinguished career of more than 40 years with the Los Angeles Lakers, Mr. Hearn saw the Lakers capture nine NBA titles.  He had the opportunity to watch the careers of basketball stars such as Jerry West, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Magic Johnson, and he spread his love of basketball to all who listened.  He is a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame and the Sportcasters Hall of Fame.  In honor of Chick Hearn's dedicated service, it is my pleasure to introduce legislation to name the post office at 5805 White Oak Avenue in Encino, CA.  It is my hope that the Senate will approve this legislation, and honor the memory of Chick Hearn.                                 ______                                       By
