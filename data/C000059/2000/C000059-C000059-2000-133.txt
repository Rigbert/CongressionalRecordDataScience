Speaker, I'm pleased to introduce legislation that will assist in establishing an interpretive and cultural center in the vicinity of the Diamond Valley Reservoir in southern California. This center will preserve, protect and make available the extraordinary discoveries that were uncovered during the construction of the Diamond Valley Reservoir to all citizens of the United States.  During the past five years, the construction of the Diamond Valley Reservoir outside of Hemet, California has been the largest, private, earth moving construction project in the United States. The Reservoir is now the largest man made lake in southern California. It covers 4,500 acres, is 4.5 miles long and 2 miles wide and is 160-250 feet deep. The cost of $1.8 billion for construction was totally borne by the residents of southern California. The reservoir will provide a desperately needed emergency supply of water for the city of Los Angeles and the surrounding area.  During the construction and excavation of this massive project, extraordinary paleontology and archeology discoveries were uncovered. Unearthed were 365 prehistoric sites, pictographs, petroglyphs, stone tools, bone tools, and arrow heads. In addition, a preserved mastodon skeleton, a mammoth skeleton and a 7 foot tusk and bones from extinct animals previously unknown to have resided in the area including the giant Long-Horned Bison and an enormous North American Lion were discovered. In addition, the construction of the Diamond Valley Reservoir unearthed the largest known accumulation of late Ice Age fossils known in California. The scientific importance of this collection may now rival California's other famed site, the La Brea Tar Pits.  It is my honor to introduce legislation which will be the first step in preserving this world class collection of archaeological, paleontological and late Ice Age fossils for future generations.                          ____________________
