President, let me say a few words about Judge Kapala. Frederick Kapala has been nominated by Senator Obama and myself to be a Federal district court judge in the Northern District of Illinois. Judge Kapala has served with distinction as a State court judge in Illinois for the past quarter century, and he has earned a great reputation. It is a very positive thing to say that 99 percent of the attorneys surveyed gave Judge Kapala a positive recommendation for his temperament, integrity, and management skills. He had a unanimous rating of ``well qualified'' by the American Bar Association, the highest rating a nominee can receive. He has been judged by many to be an excellent candidate for the Federal bench.  I have met with him personally. I have met his family. I like this man. I think he will serve our judiciary well. I hope when we vote on this in a few minutes he will receive an overwhelming vote of support.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
