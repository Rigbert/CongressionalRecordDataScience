Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. DeFAZIO. When I was first elected to office, I served with a very conservative Republican, and he used to say that government is about roads and rope.  He was talking about the basis for our system here in America--the basics. He was talking about transportation, the Boston Post Road, the original roads of America that tied a young Nation together on rope. He was talking about law enforcement here on Earth, law enforcement protecting American citizens from criminals.  Now, somehow the Cross-Agency Support account, which is an unbelievable catchall slush fund at NASA which has grown in the last 2 years from $550 million to $3 billion and which will actually be increased in this continuing resolution by $36 million, is more important than defending the American people from criminals, from lawbreakers, which is the most basic requirement of the Government of the United States.  Now, this isn't even like real stuff at NASA. It's not the fantasy about going to Mars or any of the other things they're engaged in for many billions of dollars.                              {time}  2240  This is a cross-agency support budget which has gone up six times, 600 percent in 2 years, and it's going to go up again here today, and we're going to slash the heck out of the COPS program. Now, go home and explain that to your constituents. You can't even say, Look up there, because it's not a satellite. It's not headed to the Moon or to Mars. You have to say, Hey, it's the cross-agency support budget at NASA, and when the criminal is breaking down your door, call NASA. That probably isn't going to work too well.  This not only supports police on the streets in overstretched agencies, it supports--and we've had a lot of talk about urban America--sheriffs in our rural areas which are woefully unpoliced, and in my district we've got money out of this account which you're cutting by 65 percent to go after methamphetamine manufacturing and Mexican cartels moving methamphetamine up the West Coast of the United States. We're going to cut that 65 percent because it's more important that we fund the cross-agency support budget of NASA and we increase it by 600 percent in 2 years and we decrease funding for COPS and sheriffs and drug reduction in our communities, in our schools, in our rural areas by 65 percent.  Well, you go on home and campaign on that, and I will be campaigning on my issues.
