Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today and pay tribute to a celebrated community servant, Mr. John E. Bierman. On Friday, March 22, 1996, John, along with his friends and family, will celebrate his retirement from the Knights of Columbus Ballroom in East Chicago, IN.  We are fortunate to have dedicated people, like John, involved in the labor movement in Indiana's First Congressional District. Indeed, John personifies true selfless dedication. John was raised in Albany, GA, as one of seven boys. In 1950, after serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, John migrated to the Calumet Region. At this time, John was hired at Inland Steel and became a member of the United Steelworkers of America Local Union 1010. In 1969, John assumed the position of staff representative, and it is this position from which he is retiring.  Outside of his professional career, John has devoted a large portion of his life to the betterment of northwest Indiana. John is a member of American Legion Post 66 and has acquired a lifetime membership to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Moreover, he has organized the Sub-2 food pantry, and for 7 years John coached and managed the Griffith Babe Ruth Baseball League.  Politically, John has been a Democratic precinct committeeman for 25 years and has been the chairman of the Democratic Precinct Organization for the Griffith-Calumet Township for 35 years.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to remember all who have worked hard to fulfill the American dream. I offer my heartfelt congratulations to John, who has worked arduously to make this dream possible for others. John has proven himself to be a distinguished advocate for the labor movement, and he has made northwest Indiana a better place in which to live and work. I sincerely wish John a long, happy, and productive retirement.                          ____________________
