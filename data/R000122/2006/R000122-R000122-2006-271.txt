President, before I comment on the nomination, I would like to recognize and thank several people who have been very helpful in preparing my comments: Kara Stein, Justin Florence, and Sharon Rapport.  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a series of letters from national organizations with respect to issues of church and state separation and the nomination of Judge Alito.
