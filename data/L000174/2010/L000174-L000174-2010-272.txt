He has served in a number of positions, including chief counsel for the Judiciary Committee when the chairman was then-Senator Joe Biden. He spent years in private practice and as a professor, including for the last 10 years as director for the Program in Public Law at Duke University Law School. He has also served in a number of high-ranking positions at the Justice Department making him extraordinarily well prepared for the position to which he has been nominated. In fact, in my nearly 36 years here, it is hard to think of somebody more well qualified.  Look what he has done. He graduated from Princeton University, received his master of divinity from Yale Divinity School before earning his law degree from the University of California at Berkeley Boalt Hall in 1974.
