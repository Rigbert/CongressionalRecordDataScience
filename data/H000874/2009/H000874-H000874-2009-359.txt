 As you know, we believe that the substitute that was offered to the recovery and reinvestment package that was defeated in a bipartisan way created--and there is a difference in this--our perception of this is 2 million less jobs than the bill that we offered and that was passed, which we think either created or saved 3.5 million jobs.  Having said that, you asked about an additional relief package. I note you quoted the newspapers as talking about Mr. Zandi, who was one of Mr. McCain's advisors during the course of the last campaign.  But I also noted in the paper that you are also quoted as saying, House Minority Whip Eric Cantor didn't rule out the idea of a second stimulus package and said Wednesday he would be willing to sit down with the White House and congressional Democrats to discuss any new emergency spending proposals.  I appreciate that offer, and I want to show the gentleman that when and if--and I have no reason to believe, by the way, that Mr. Obey is doing anything as reported in the paper that he might be doing, I have no reason to believe he is doing that--but I want you to know that in light of your interest in sitting down, that I share that interest, and we will do that.
