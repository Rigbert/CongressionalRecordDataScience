I was in Joliet, IL, at a hospital cafeteria, sitting at a table full of doctors. One of the doctors was so angry because he kept getting this clerk on the phone: No, that patient can't be admitted. He finally said to the voice on the other end of the phone: Are you a doctor? The employee of the insurance company said no. Well, are you a nurse? No. Well, are you a college graduate? No. How can you possibly overrule my decision on treating a patient? She said: I am going by the book.  She had a book in front of her that had the complaints that a person might register and whether or not a treatment was warranted.  That medical care has now been reduced to the level that we have people who are reading books and overruling doctors who have been trained gives everyone concern.  One of the reasons we need to bring up this Patients' Bill of Rights is to make sure that doctors and medical care personnel across the country can make the best professional decision for the people they treat--a decision based on a person's health and their well-being as opposed to the bottom line profit margin of the insurance company that is involved in it.
