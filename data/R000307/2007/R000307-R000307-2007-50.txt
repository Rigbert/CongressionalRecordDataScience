FEINGOLD. Madam President, at the conclusion of my remarks, I would be happy to yield.  Congress authorized this war, and it is in our power to bring it to a close. More importantly, we have not just the power but the responsibility to end a war that is draining vital national security resources in pursuit of a goal that cannot be achieved militarily.
