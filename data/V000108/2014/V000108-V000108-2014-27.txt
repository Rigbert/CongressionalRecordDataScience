Chairman, I would point out, relative to the gentleman's suggestion that we need to make sure the laws of the land are followed, that that is exactly what we do in this bill.  Chairman Frelinghuysen had an amendment in the full committee, which I supported and spoke on behalf of, given the recent transfer of Taliban prisoners by the administration, and the fact is, in section 9015 of the bill, as printed and pending, it says:       No more than 15 percent of the funds made available may be      obligated until the Secretary of Defense provides the      congressional Defense and Intelligence Committees with a      detailed spend plan for the funds provided.  Essentially, the chairman's initiative that I supported--and the committee voted for--fences that money off to make sure the law is followed. This amendment is unnecessary.  I will continue to reserve the balance of my time.
