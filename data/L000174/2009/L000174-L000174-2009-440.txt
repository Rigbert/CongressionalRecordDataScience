President, the Senate was poised today to confirm three more superbly qualified nominees to fill top leadership positions at the Department of Justice before adjourning for the 2-week April recess. Instead, the Republican minority has returned to the tactics of anonymous and unaccountable holds they employed when they were in the majority to block scores of President Clinton's nominees.  Attorney General Holder needs his leadership team in place to rebuild and restore the Department. Tony West, President Obama's nominee to lead the Civil Division, Lanny Breuer, nominated to head the Criminal Division, and Christine Varney, nominated to head the Antitrust Division, have all chosen to leave lucrative private practices to return to Government service.  None of these are controversial nominees. They all received numerous letters of strong support, and endorsements from both Republican and Democratic former public officials. They were all reported out of the Judiciary Committee last week by unanimous consent. We should be confirming them today, not holding them hostage to the tired partisan playbook of Senate Republicans.  Tony West knows the Department of Justice well. He served in the Department as a Special Assistant to Deputy Attorneys General Philip Heymann and Jamie Gorelick. He then worked as a Federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California. His commitment to public service continued when he became a Special Assistant Attorney General in the California Department of Justice. He has also worked in private practice. Mr. West is a graduate of Harvard University and Stanford University Law School, where he served as president of the Stanford Law Review.  His nomination has earned support from both sides of the aisle. The former chairman of the California Republican Party, George Sundheim, sent a letter to the committee stating that Mr. West is admired by ``both sides of the aisle'' for his ``integrity, honesty and decency,'' and that there is no one ``more qualified to assume a position of leadership in the Department of Justice.'' The Federal prosecutors who worked across the table from Mr. West during the high-profile prosecution of John Walker Lindh witnessed Mr. West's ``extraordinary professionalism,'' and ``smart advocacy . . . executed with the highest degree of integrity.'' We should be confirming this outstanding leader for the Civil Division today.  President Obama has said that Lanny Breuer has the ``depth of experience and integrity'' to fulfill the highest standards of the American people and the Department of Justice. I agree. Mr. Breuer began his legal career as an assistant district attorney in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. He told us during his hearing that his commitment to ensuring justice for all Americans stemmed from his days working on the front lines of the fight against crime as a Manhattan prosecutor. His call to public service continued while serving in the White House Counsel's Office as a special counsel to President Clinton. Mr. Breuer has also worked in private practice for the prestigious Washington, DC, law firm of Covington & Burling. He is a graduate of Columbia Law School and Columbia University.  Michael Chertoff, who led the Criminal Division at the Department of Justice during the Bush administration, endorsed Mr. Breuer's nomination, saying he has ``exceptionally broad legal experience as a former prosecutor and defense attorney'' and has ``outstanding judgment, a keen sense of fairness, high integrity and an even temperament.'' Brad Berenson, a veteran of the Bush administration's White House counsel's office, writes that Mr. Breuer is ``everything one could hope for in a leader of the Criminal Division.''  Mr. Breuer's former colleagues from the Manhattan District Attorney's Office have said that as a criminal prosecutor, he ``distinguished himself as a tenacious but scrupulously fair trial lawyer, driven by the unwavering goal of achieving justice.'' Former Deputy Attorney General Larry D. Thompson and former Congressman and DEA Administrator Asa Hutchinson have also written to the committee in support of Mr. Breuer's nomination. I agree with all their comments and wish the Republican minority was not stalling confirmation of Mr. Breuer's nomination.  Christine Varney was confirmed to be a U.S. Federal Trade Commissioner in 1994, after being nominated by President Clinton. As a Federal Trade Commissioner, Ms. Varney gained valuable experience in antitrust enforcement and in reducing anticompetitive measures that harm American consumers. Her Government service work includes a high level position in President Clinton's White House, where she served as an assistant to the President and secretary to the Cabinet. She has worked in private practice for the prestigious Washington, DC, law firm of Hogan & Hartson. She also graduated from my alma mater, the Georgetown University Law Center.  Her nomination is supported by individuals who served in the Antitrust Division during both Democratic and Republican administrations. John Shenefield and James Rill, both former heads of the Antitrust Division, say that she is ``extraordinarily well qualified to lead the Antitrust Division.'' Twenty former chairs of the American Bar Association Section of Antitrust Law have described Ms. Varney as a ``highly accomplished, capable nominee who will serve consumers and this country with distinction'' and who will have ``immediate credibility'' in her new position.  I agree. At a time when our economy is suffering, there is a temptation to act anticompetitively. We need to make sure that we have a strong and effective advocate for competition and the interests of consumers in place. Now is not the time for delay.  Republican Senators delayed for weeks the confirmation of Harvard Law School Dean Elena Kagan to be the Solicitor General of the United States, before demanding an extended debate on her nomination. They have yet to consent to a time agreement on the nomination of Dawn Johnsen to lead the critical Office of Legal Counsel. And they are now holding up three nominations today, including the nomination of Christine Varney to head the Antitrust Division. I am concerned that Republican delay tactics are creating a double standard for these highly qualified women. Republicans did not apply the same standards or make the same demands for extensive followup information and meetings when supporting President Bush's nominations to the same posts.  Indeed, The New York Times and Roll Call yesterday each featured reports suggesting that Senate Republicans intend to, and are planning to, filibuster the nomination of Dawn Johnsen to serve as the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department. I cannot remember a time when Democratic Senators filibustered a Justice Department nomination. Speech after speech by Republican Senators just a few short years ago about how it would be unconstitutional to filibuster Presidential nominees appear now to be just speeches that served a partisan political purpose at the time.  During last week's formal installation of the Attorney General, President Obama reminded Americans and the world that what makes our country unique is that ``we are bound together not by a shared bloodline or allegiance to any one leader or faith or creed, but by an adherence to a set of ideals.'' The men and women at the Department of Justice have a special duty to uphold the rule of law because ``laws are only as effective, only as compassionate, [and] only as fair as those who enforce them.''  All of the nominees we should be considering and confirming today fit the mold described by President Obama and the best traditions of the Department of Justice. I urge Republican Senators to reconsider their partisan obstructionist approach and return from recess ready to end the delays and confirm these nominees.                          ____________________
