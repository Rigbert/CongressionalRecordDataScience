President, I rise today to congratulate the Greater Salem Chamber of Commerce of Salem, Illinois, which will celebrate its 100th anniversary on July 23.  A century ago, seven Illinoisans founded the Salem Business Men's Association, which was later renamed the Greater Salem Chamber of Commerce. As they stated in their original charter, its purpose was ``to promote and encourage the location of manufactories and other industries in our city * * * and to encourage in all proper and lawful ways the development of our city and its surrounding country.'' It is hard to imagine that the seven founders could have foreseen how their association would grow and flourish into the present.  Today, the Chamber supports the community of Salem through numerous projects ranging from economic development to educational support. Inaddition, the Chamber serves as a network for local businesses and a coordinator between them and the government of Salem. The Chamber also fosters a general sense of community in Salem, by welcoming new residents and promoting consciousness of Salem's unique heritage.  In its role as coordinator, networker, and initiator, the Chamber has proven itself to be a crucial player in Salem's recent economic expansion. The city of Salem can boast a net gain of 900 jobs over the past five years. These gains are due in no small part to the efforts of the Chamber of Commerce.  With a century of success behind it, the Chamber is now working to secure the future prosperity of Salem. The Chamber regularly notifies businesses of education and training opportunities so that Salem's labor force can continue to adapt to the changing needs of the economy. Further, the Chamber was instrumental in developing the Tech Prep program, which provides 25 local high school students with internships that prepare them for future careers.  Throughout its history, the Chamber has proven itself to be an indispensable asset to the city of Salem and the state of Illinois. Again, I would like to extend my congratulations to the Chamber and all of its members and hope that their second century is as successful as their first.                          ____________________
