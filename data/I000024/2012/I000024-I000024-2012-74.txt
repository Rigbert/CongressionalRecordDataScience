 There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 2012.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Leader: Recently, there has been renewed interest      in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, a      treaty     completed in 1982 and modified in 1994. After careful      consideration, we have concluded that on balance this treaty      is not in the national interest of the United States. As a      result, we would oppose the treaty if it were called up for a      vote.       Proponents of the Law of the Sea treaty aspire to admirable      goals, including codifying the U.S. Navy's navigational      rights and defining American economic interests in valuable      offshore resources. But the treaty's terms reach well beyond      those good intentions. This agreement is striking in both the      breadth of activities it regulates and the ambiguity of      obligations it creates. Its 320 articles and over 200 pages      establish a complex regulatory regime that applies to      virtually any commercial or governmental activity related to      the oceans--from seaborne shipping, to drug and weapon      interdiction, to operating a manufacturing plant near a      coastal waterway.       The terms of the treaty are not only expansive, but often      ill-defined. Article 194, for example, broadly requires      nations to ``take . . . all measures consistent with this      Convention that are necessary to prevent, reduce and control      pollution of the marine environment from any source, using      for this purpose the best practicable means at their disposal      and in accordance with their capabilities.'' Article 207      decrees that ``[s]tates shall adopt laws and regulations to      prevent, reduce and control pollution of the marine      environment from land-based sources . . . taking into account      internationally agreed rules.'' Article 293 empowers      tribunals to enforce not only the treaty provisions but also      ``other rules of international law not incompatible with [the      treaty].'' Because the treaty authorizes international      legislative and judicial bodies to give shape and substance      to these and other open-ended commitments, the United States      would be binding itself to yet-unknown requirements and      liabilities. That uncertainty alone is reason for caution.       The treaty's breadth and ambiguity might be less troubling      if there were adequate assurance that it will be enforced      impartially and in a manner consistent with U.S. interests.      But that is not so. The United States could block some but      not all actions of the International Seabed Authority, a      legislative body vested with significant power over more than      half of the earth's surface. Further, the treaty's judicial      bodies are empowered to issue binding judgments even over      U.S. objections. In some cases, the United States could elect      to resolve disputes before a five-member arbitration      tribunal, in which we would choose two arbitrators. But the      United States would have no hand in selecting the decisive,      fifth arbitrator, unless it could agree with the opposing      party. Other cases would be decided by the powerful      International Tribunal, which is even less accountable to the      United States. Comprised of 21 foreign judges with no      guaranteed U.S. seat, the tribunal can resolve any dispute      concerning interpretation of the treaty. It has compulsory      jurisdiction over disputes concerning the seabed beyond      national borders and power to grant preliminary injunctive      relief whenever it deems necessary ``to preserve the      respective rights of the parties to the dispute or to prevent      serious harm to the marine environment.''       The method of executing tribunal judgments further concerns      us. Unlike many international agreements, key provisions of      the Law of the Sea treaty are drafted to be ``self-     executing,'' meaning that certain tribunal judgments would      automatically constitute enforceable federal law, without      congressional legislation or meaningful review by our      nation's judiciary. As Justice John Paul Stevens noted in a      concurring opinion in Medellin v. Texas, the Law of the Sea      treaty appears to ``incorporate international judgments into      domestic law'' because it expressly provides that decisions      of the tribunal `` `shall be enforceable in the territories      of the States Parties in the same manner as judgments or      orders of the highest court of the State Party in whose      territory the enforcement is sought.' '' In other words, the      treaty equates tribunal decisions with decisions of the U.S.      Supreme Court. This means that private litigants will likely      be able to invoke tribunal judgments as enforceable in U.S.      courts--against the government and possibly against U.S.      businesses. The United States will have no lawful choice but      to acquiesce to tribunal judgments, however burdensome or      unfair.       The treaty could also spawn international environmental      tort claims directly against U.S. businesses and citizens. A      federal law called the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) gives courts      the power to hear ``any civil action by an alien for a tort .      . . committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty      of the United States.'' Remarkably, even though the U.S. has      not yet ratified the Law of the Sea treaty, the treaty has      already been invoked as a basis for ATS litigation targeting      industrial activities. In a 2002 lawsuit brought by residents      of Papua New Guinea against a mining corporation, a federal      district court in California held that the plaintiffs had      stated a valid ATS claim under the environmental provisions      of the Law of the Sea treaty. A panel of the Ninth Circuit      agreed. Accession to the treaty would only strengthen ATS      claims like this 2002 lawsuit by transforming international      environmental norms into a binding treaty obligation.       In short, we are deeply concerned about the treaty's      breadth and ambiguity, the inadequate U.S. input in the      treaty's adjudicative bodies, and the automatic enforcement      of tribunal judgments in the United States. Against these      risks to U.S. sovereignty, however, we have also carefully      weighed the potential benefits of the treaty.       As members of the Armed Services Committee, we are mindful      that the Defense Department believes this treaty would help      secure the navigational freedom of our fleet. We take this      recommendation seriously and recognize that the treaty would      provide an additional tool to our diplomatic and military      leaders in resolving maritime disputes. We also understand      the commercial interests associated with treaty accession.      Several U.S. businesses have explained that the treaty would      enhance investment in energy development and mineral      extraction by increasing certainty about ownership claims.      Specifically, the treaty would codify rights to resources in      the U.S. exclusive economic zone, the extended continental      shelf, and the deep seabed. It would also give the United      States a formal role in the Commission on the Limits of the      Continental Shelf, which is now reviewing claims by treaty      members in the Arctic.       At the same time, even treaty proponents recognize that      these provisions primarily clarify rights that the United      States already possesses under customary international law      and has other means of asserting. For example, the treaty's      200-nautical-mile rule defining coastal states' exclusive      economic zones is consistent with longstanding U.S. claims.      Moreover, the United States has successfully used bilateral      negotiations with Russia and Mexico to define claims to the      extended continental shelf in the Gulf of Mexico and the      Arctic. Similarly, the treaty's navigational regimes reflect      the current practices of the U.S. Navy, and we believe that      our maritime interests are best secured by maintaining U.S.      naval power beyond challenge.       The real issue is not whether the United States will defend      its maritime rights, but rather who will have the final say      on the scope of those rights. We simply are not persuaded      that decisions by the International Seabed Authority and      international tribunals empowered by this treaty will be more      favorable to U.S. interests than bilateral negotiations,      voluntary arbitration, and other traditional means of      resolving maritime issues. No international organization owns      the seas, and we are confident that our nation will continue      to protect its navigational freedom, valid territorial      claims, and other maritime rights.       On balance, we believe the treaty's litigation exposure and      impositions on U.S. sovereignty outweigh its potential      benefits. For that reason, we cannot support the Law of the      Sea treaty and would oppose its ratification.
