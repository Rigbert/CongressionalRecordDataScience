 I will vote for him today (although there has been some controversy surrounding his nomination). I wish to take a minute to discuss the nomination.  Judge Davis made a number of controversial remarks a few years ago. During his hearing last Congress, Judge Davis was asked to provide some clarification regarding those comments. After carefully reviewing his answers from the hearing, many of us concluded that they didn't provide the clarity that we had hoped he would provide. For that reason, following his hearing, I asked Judge Davis some follow-up questions for the Record, hoping to get the clarity, in writing, that I didn't hear him provide during his hearing.  Unfortunately, after reviewing his written answers, I concluded that Judge Davis didn't fully appreciate why many found his comments so troubling. For instance, when I asked him about these statements he wrote that a ``number of my statements could be misunderstood'', but he neither apologized for them nor said anything to demonstrate that he fully appreciated why his comments were so problematic.  As a result, in the last Congress I reluctantly opposed his nomination.  Judge Davis, of course, was renominated this Congress. On September 12th, he submitted a letter to the Florida Senators.  In that letter, Judge Davis apologized for his comments--without qualification.  He wrote, ``I believe that several of the statements I made in the past were inappropriate and improper.'' He went on to write, ``I apologize for any inappropriate statements and deeply recognize the harm that they could cause if they gave the misimpression that I am anything other than impartial or that I maintain any bias or prejudice.''  As I wrote to Judge Davis in a follow-up letter on September 25th, unlike the last Congress, I believe the apology Judge Davis transmitted on September 12 for those comments was without qualification. Therefore, in my view, it demonstrated both courage and humility.  In my letter to Judge Davis, I asked him simply to confirm that he was apologizing for his comments regarding Dr. Henry Foster, Dr. Joycelyn Elders, and Justice Thomas.  In a follow-up letter he wrote to me on September 26, he confirmed those were the ``inappropriate comments'' he referenced in his letter to the Florida Senators.  I ask consent that both my letter to Judge Davis, and his response, be made part of the Record.  I have given this nomination a great deal of consideration. I believe Judge Davis has taken steps this Congress that, in my view, he didn't appear willing to take last Congress. Taking this into consideration, together with the fact that he enjoys the support of his home State Senators, I am willing to give Judge Davis the benefit of the doubt and will support his nomination today.  I yield the floor.                               Washington, DC, September 25, 2013.     Judge Brian J. Davis,     Nassau County Courthouse,     Fernandina Beach, FL.       Dear Judge Davis: I write to follow up on your September      12th letter to Senators Nelson and Rubio, copying me and      Chairman Leahy, regarding concerns with your record Members      of the Senate Judiciary Committee, including me, raised last      Congress.       As you alluded in your letter, during your hearing last      Congress, Senator Lee asked you a number of questions      regarding various remarks and speeches you made throughout      your career. After carefully reviewing the answers you gave      during the hearing, I concluded your responses lacked the      breadth and clarity I had hoped you would provide when      afforded the opportunity. For instance, you conceded that      some comments were ``inappropriate,'' but then stated ``they      were inappropriate for the reason that an impression could be      gotten from them that somehow the court maintained a racial      prejudice.'' That response troubled me because it did not      appear to fully recognize the reason some find those comments      concerning. Specifically, the comments appeared quite plainly      to assign a racial motivation to those who opposed particular      nominees on purely policy grounds.       Consequently, following your hearing I sent you a number of      follow up questions for the record. Again, I was hopeful to      receive some clarity regarding those comments. But after      carefully reviewing your responses, I reluctantly reached the      conclusion that you still did not fully appreciate why some      viewed your comments as inappropriate. For instance, I asked      about your comments regarding President Clinton's nomination      of Dr. Henry Foster's nomination to be surgeon general. But      rather than concede what appears to be apparent by the words      you used, you answered instead that the comments were      inappropriate because they ``could be interpreted'' in a      particular way, and therefore that you lacked impartiality.      In my view, your answers to several other questions lacked      clarity in a similar fashion. For these reasons, among      several others, reluctantly I opposed your nomination last      Congress.       With this background, I received your letter of September      12th, 2013. In your letter you wrote, without qualification,      ``I believe that several of the statements I made in the past      were inappropriate and improper.'' You went on to write, ``I      apologize for any inappropriate statements and deeply      recognize the harm that they could cause if they gave the      misimpression that I am anything other than impartial or that      I maintain any bias or prejudice.'' I note that these two      statements represent a step that you did not appear willing      to take last Congress. In my view, this demonstrates both      courage and humility. Thank you for that letter.       As your nomination is now again pending before the      Committee, I write to seek one further clarification. As I      noted, you wrote in your recent letter that you apologize for      ``any inappropriate statements,'' but you did not specify the      statements to which you referred. I want to confirm that you      are referring to your comments regarding Dr. Henry     Foster, Dr. Joycelyn Elders, and Justice Thomas.       Thank you in advance for your prompt reply.           Sincerely.                                          Charles E. Grassley,                                                   Ranking Member,     U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary.                                  ____                                                    Circuit Court,                                               Fourth Judicial                                           Circuit of Florida,                         Fernandina Beach, FL, September 26, 2013.     Senator Charles E. Grassley,     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: Thank you for your letter of      September 25, 2013, and the opportunity to further clarify my      views.       I understand your concerns, and please know that my      appreciation of the inappropriateness of statements I have      made in speeches include those referenced in your letter      regarding Dr. Foster, Dr. Elders and Justice Thomas.       Thank you for your continued consideration of my      nomination.           Sincerely,                                                   Brian J. Davis.                      Nomination of John Koskinen
