 President, like other infrastructure across Washington State and the Nation, the Ballard Locks are showing their age. Senator Cantwell and I commend the Army Corps for its work to restore and modernize the locks, and we are doing our part in Congress to support these efforts. Year after year, we work to help Presidential administrations understand the critical importance of the Army Corps' work, and we make sure budgets actually reflect that need. We stand ready to continue to work with our partners in Puget Sound to complete the necessary repairs and upgrades of the Ballard Locks, as our regional economy and the more than 200 businesses that rely upon the locks cannot afford an extended, unplanned closure.
