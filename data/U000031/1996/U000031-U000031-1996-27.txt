Speaker. As I look at my State of Michigan, a few years ago we had a debt of about almost $2 billion, which is a lot for any State. Our Governor and our legislature went after spending, tightened everybody's belts. Today they have cut taxes 23 times in the last 3 years. We can do the same here, but we have to focus on the spending side. We have to do something about deficits that average somewhere between $150 billion and $250 billion over the last couple years, and we have to do it together. That means this side of the aisle and this side of the aisle working together to get the job done, and really get the budget balanced.
