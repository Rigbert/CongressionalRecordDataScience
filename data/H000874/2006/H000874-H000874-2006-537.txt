We appreciate your comments, Mr. Leader.  The PATRIOT Act, that was supposed to be on the calendar, we thought, this week. It is not on the calendar. I see you have not mentioned it in the work for next week.  Can you tell me whether we expect it to come before us next week as a suspension bill or under a rule?
