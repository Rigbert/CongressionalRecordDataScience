 President, I want to take a moment to commend President Bush for his superb remarks regarding freedom and democracy in Asia. It is fitting that these comments were made in Japan, a key strategic ally of the United States.  I will not recount the entire speech--which I encourage all my colleagues to read--but will highlight two paragraphs. The President said:       Unlike China, some Asian nations still have not taken even      the first steps toward freedom. These regimes understand that      economic liberty and political liberty go hand in hand, and      they refuse to open up at all. The ruling parties in these      countries have managed to hold onto power. The price of their      refusal to open up is isolation, backwardness, and brutality.      By closing the door to freedom, they create misery at home      and sow instability abroad. These nations represent Asia's      past, not its future.       We see that lack of freedom in Burma--a nation that should      be one of the most prosperous and successful in Asia but is      instead one of the region's poorest. Fifteen years ago, the      Burmese people cast their ballots--and they chose democracy.      The government responded by jailing the leader of the pro-     democracy majority. The result is that a country rich in      human talent and natural resources is a place where millions      struggle simply to stay alive. The abuses by the Burmese      military are widespread, and include rape, and torture, and      execution, and forced relocation. Forced labor, trafficking      in persons, and use of child soldiers, and religious      discrimination are all too common. The people of Burma live      in the darkness of tyranny--but the light of freedom shines      in their hearts. They want their liberty--and one day, they      will have it.  These words should ring loudly and clearly throughout the region. I commend President Bush for these comments and for the solid leadership he provides in supporting freedom in Burma. Moreover, I applaud the efforts made by President Bush and Secretary Rice to put Burma on the U.N. Security Council's agenda.                          ____________________[Page S13148]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                       FREEDOM IN ASIA AND BURMA  Mr. McCONNELL.
