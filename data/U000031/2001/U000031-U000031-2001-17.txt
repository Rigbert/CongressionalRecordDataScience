Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 496) to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to promote deployment of advanced services and foster the development of competition for the benefit of consumers in all regions of the Nation by relieving unnecessary burdens on the Nation's two percent local exchange telecommunications carriers, and for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H. R. 496       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Independent      Telecommunications Consumer Enhancement Act of 2001''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:       (1) The Telecommunications Act of 1996 was enacted to      foster the rapid deployment of advanced telecommunications      and information technologies and services to all Americans by      promoting competition and reducing regulation in      telecommunications markets nationwide.       (2) The Telecommunications Act of 1996 specifically      recognized the unique abilities and circumstances of local      exchange carriers with fewer than two percent of the Nation's      subscriber lines installed in the aggregate nationwide.       (3) Given the markets two percent carriers typically serve,      such carriers are uniquely positioned to accelerate the      deployment of advanced services and competitive initiatives      for the benefit of consumers in less densely populated      regions of the Nation.       (4) Existing regulations are typically tailored to the      circumstances of larger carriers and therefore often impose      disproportionate burdens on two percent carriers, impeding      such carriers' deployment of advanced telecommunications      services and competitive initiatives to consumers in less      densely populated regions of the Nation.       (5) Reducing regulatory burdens on two percent carriers      will enable such carriers to devote additional resources to      the deployment of advanced services and to competitive      initiatives to benefit consumers in less densely populated      regions of the Nation.       (6) Reducing regulatory burdens on two percent carriers      will increase such carriers' ability to respond to      marketplace conditions, allowing them to accelerate      deployment of advanced services and competitive initiatives      to benefit consumers in less densely populated regions of the      Nation.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to accelerate the deployment of advanced services and      the development of competition in the telecommunications      industry for the benefit of consumers in all regions of the      Nation, consistent with the Telecommunications Act of 1996,      by reducing regulatory burdens on local exchange carriers      with fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines      installed in the aggregate nationwide;       (2) to improve such carriers' flexibility to undertake such      initiatives; and       (3) to allow such carriers to redirect resources from      paying the costs of such regulatory burdens to increasing      investment in such initiatives.     SEC. 3. DEFINITION.       Section 3 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 153)      is amended--       (1) by redesignating paragraphs (51) and (52) as paragraphs      (52) and (53), respectively; and       (2) by inserting after paragraph (50) the following:       ``(51) Two percent carrier.--The term `two percent carrier'      means an incumbent local exchange carrier within the meaning      of section 251(h) whose access lines, when aggregated with      the access lines of any local exchange carrier that such      incumbent local exchange carrier directly or indirectly      controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with,      are fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines      installed in the aggregate nationwide.''.
