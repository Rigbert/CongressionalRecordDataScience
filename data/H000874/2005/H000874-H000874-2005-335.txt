Speaker, I thank the leader for those comments.  On a more immediate basis, next week we are scheduled obviously to come in on Tuesday at 12:30, and Friday is on the schedule. Is it the majority leader's expectation that we will probably be in on Friday or is Friday there if we need to be?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will continue to yield, Mr. Speaker, I would say that it is difficult to predict at this point in time.  Clearly, if the only items of the House for the House to consider next week are the ones I just outlined, then we could complete our work by Thursday afternoon. However, if additional legislation relating to Katrina becomes necessary or a conference report becomes available, Members should be prepared to have votes on Friday.
