Speaker, I rise today to recognize the lifelong contributions that Representative Darrell W. Opfer has made to Ohio and more specifically, the Fifty-Third Ohio House District. For the last seven years, Darrell has been the epitome of a public servant in the Ohio House of Representatives. He works tirelessly to represent both Ohio and his district to the best of his ability, and for this we are greatly indebted. On behalf of Ohio's lawmakers and citizens, I am pleased and honored to pay tribute to this outstanding leader.  Born and raised Elmore, Ohio, Darrell has been a resident of Ottawa County and the Fifty-Third district his entire life. After completing bachelor's and master's degrees from Bowling Green State University, he entered the Peace Corps as a volunteer school teacher, instructing schoolchildren in East Africa. Upon his return, he spent sixteen years teaching high school government and social studies at Genova High School.  Darrell began his political career by serving as an Ottawa County Commissioner for ten years. During this time, he helped form the Ottawa County Visitors Bureau and the Community Improvement Corporation. These organizations have improved the quality of life in his district, as each implemented programs to create more jobs and support local businesses.  Darrell was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives, where during his first term he became known for his bipartisanship. During his tenure in the Ohio General Assembly, he was a member of the Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee, Finance and Appropriations Committee, Local Government and Townships Committee and Veteran's Affairs Committee. He was also the ranking minority member of the Agriculture and Development Subcommittee. In his last two terms in office, he was dedicated to bringing about electric deregulation, attempting to meet the needs of schools, local government, industry, customers, and public utilities. Through his career Darrell passed a remarkable amount of legislation, personally sponsoring 30 bills and co-sponsoring 718 others. During his years of service in Columbus, he never missed a session of the Ohio House of Representatives and never missed a vote. In 1991, he earned the Outstanding Chief Elected Official Award, presented by Ohio Training Directors Council. His steadfast dedication in representing his district as an Ohio House Member was only interrupted by state mandated term limits.  Darrell has always been wise counsel to other elected officials and community leaders, quietly building coalitions on issues, bringing various points of view together in discussions, and offering his expertise with myriad concerns. Throughout his years as a Commissioner and State Representative, I have sought his advice many times and know him to be a man possessed of great skill and a wealth of knowledge. He has truly been an invaluable resource for all Ohioans and for us in Northwest Ohio.  Upon Darrell Opfer's retirement from the State House, the prosperity of Ottawa County and jobs for its residents continue to drive his ambitions. After careful consideration, he accepted the position of director of Ottawa County's economic development program. He plans to use his government, utility, and business acumen to further economic development throughout Ottawa County.  Walter Lippman once said, ``The final test of a leader is that he leaves behind him in other men the conviction and the will to carry on. . . . The genius of a good leader is to leave behind him a situation which common sense, without the grace of genius, can deal with successfully.'' The work of Darrell Opfer has made out state a better place to live. On behalf of the entire Ohio community, I would like to thank you, Darrell, for your loyalty and service to our state and your district. We will certainly miss your skills as a legislator, but you know that you will continue your dedication to leadership and service in your new position. Good luck and God bless.                          ____________________
