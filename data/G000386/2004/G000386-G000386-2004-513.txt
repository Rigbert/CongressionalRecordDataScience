 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Kyl amendment be temporarily set aside and, further, that the Senate now proceed to the consideration of amendment No. 2261, as modified, which is at the desk. I further ask consent that the amendment be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.
