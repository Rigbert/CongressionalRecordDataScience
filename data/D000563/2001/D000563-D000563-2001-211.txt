MURRAY. Yes. This bill has been debated in the Senate for an entire week now. We began debate last Friday morning. I made my opening remarks. Senator Shelby and I have worked very closely on this bill. He made his opening remarks. We opened it up for debate. We have one amendment that is now pending on the bill that Senator Shelby and I put forward which adds additional safety requirements to the underlying bill. It is, frankly, supported by every Member of the Senate, and by the White House, which has been requesting improved safety conditions as well. That began last Friday.  We asked Members to come to the floor to begin the debate, and we offered our bill up for amendment.
