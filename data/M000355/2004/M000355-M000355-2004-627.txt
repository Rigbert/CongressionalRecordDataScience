 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 12 noon, Monday, March 8. I further ask unanimous consent that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then begin consideration of the fiscal year 2005 budget resolution, if available, as provided under the previous order. I further ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding the Senate's adjournment, it be in order for the Foreign Relations and Budget Committees to file legislation from 10 a.m. to 12 noon tomorrow.
