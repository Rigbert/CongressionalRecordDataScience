President, I am very pleased to be an original cosponsor of Senator Lautenberg's legislation, the War Crimes Prosecution Facilitation Act of 1997.  Senator Lautenberg has consistently called for stronger action to bring war crimes in the former Yugoslavia to justice, and I appreciate his efforts and commend him for keeping the spotlight on this.  I am not going to repeat what Senator Lautenberg has already said about why this legislation is needed. He has discussed it in detail. It is simply outrageous that people who are believed to be responsible for some of the most heinous crimes in this century have been living and traveling freely within the former Yugoslavia, their whereabouts a matter of public knowledge.  My own view is that NATO forces, or some special contingent specifically constituted to capture war criminals, should go after these people. The longer we wait, the more powerless NATO appears, and the more convinced these people are that they have nothing to fear. But until that happens, at the very least, we should not give aid to governments that harbor war criminals, especially considering that they pledged to cooperate fully with the War Crimes Tribunal.  That is the purpose of this legislation--to deny aid to governments of the former Yugoslavia until they arrest and turn over indicted war criminals who are within territory under that control, or to projects in communities whose local authorities are protecting war criminals or preventing refugees from returning home. Frankly, that should already be U.S. Government policy. There should be no need for this legislation. Since our goal is to promote reconciliation, the bill does make appropriate exceptions for humanitarian and other limited assistance.  Mr. President, I want to again thank Senator Lautenberg for his leadership, I hope that the administration will respond by telling us that they are in agreement with this legislation and will conform their policy accordingly.
