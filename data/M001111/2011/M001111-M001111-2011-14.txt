 President, I thank Senator Coburn for his passion on this issue. He has raised valid concerns about the bad actors who are part of the Federal program.  The problem is, the way this is drafted, it goes too far. This amendment puts the tenants at risk. It will put the tenants out of a place to live.  Earlier, I offered to work with the Senator to address the issue in a way that would make sure we protect residents. We were not able to get to a resolution. I hope we can continue to work on this. This amendment, as drafted, will put the tenants at risk and out. If once in 5 years a HUD property falls under the troubled category, the tenants will be at risk.  I ask my colleagues to reject this amendment. I offer to work with the Senator to address this in a way that gets after the problem he has defined.
