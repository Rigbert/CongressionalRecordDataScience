Here is a letter from a man from Yorkville, IL, who wrote me:       On bailout after bailout for businesses, my tax dollars      have been used to save companies that should have planned      better in the first place. Now I am unemployed--not because I      made some poor decisions like AIG or Citigroup, but because      in today's economy, the company I worked for folded. . . .       If the Senate cannot reach an agreement . . . to extend      unemployment, myself, my wife, and our two young children      will have nowhere to live other than our car. How about a      bailout for those of us Americans that have worked all our      lives and now cannot get a decent job?       I am begging you to stand up in front of the Senate . . .      and demand that congress work harder for those of us who put      all of you in office. The next time you need our votes,      hopefully the 10% of unemployed Americans will not have had      their cars repossessed so that we may make it to our local      polling places.  Well, he kept a sense of humor in his misfortune. But this is an example of a man who thought he had a good job and a good future who now is contemplating living in his car. And now we are saying, because of the objection of one Senator, that we are not going to provide unemployment benefits to thousands of people in similar situations as of Sunday night. Why we are doing this to these poor people at this moment in time is impossible to explain.
