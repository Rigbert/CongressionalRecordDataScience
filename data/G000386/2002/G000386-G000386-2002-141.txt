 President, I am today introducing a bill on behalf of myself and Senators Kerry and Torricelli, to accomplish two objectives related to defined benefit pension plans.  First, my bill will permit defined benefit plans to use an appropriate adjusted interest rate for purposes of calculating contributions to their plan due for plan year 2001. We made this change in the economic stimulus bill that passed earlier this year for the years 2002 and 2003, but failed to pick up the 2001 plan year.  My colleagues may think that such a change should have been made a year ago. Defined benefit pension plan contributions for 2001 are due in most cases, 8\1/2\ months after the close of the plan year. By that measure, this change is still timely. I would also draw the attention of my colleagues to the fact that this adjustment is necessary to correct for the very low 30-year Treasury bond rates that have resulted from the buy-back and discontinuation of these bonds.  It is also important to note that this change will not affect the way in which pension payouts are made to participants. It will simply affect contributions to plans and premiums paid to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation by plan sponsors.  Second, the bill would make permanent a special rule for certain interstate bus lines that was put in place in the 1997 tax bill. That rule allows interstate bus lines with frozen pension plans to use generally applicableERISA funding rules for their plan, rather than those mandated by the pension the GATT which were enacted in 1994.  The change we make for interstate bus lines with frozen defined benefit plans is unique to this group. Generally the GATT made useful changes to pension law that made plans more secure for participants. The use of standardized interest rates and mortality tables has helped establish a baseline so that plan sponsors understand our expectations of how they must fund their plans.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill, along with a letter of support from the Amalgamated Transit Union, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2563       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Hon. Charles Grassley,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: On behalf of the Amalgamated Transit      Union (ATU), I write to express our support for your proposed      Senate bill to apply recent changes made to the Tax Code to      the year 2001 and to make permanent the relief for certain      interstate bus company pension plans from GATT-mandated      funding requirements. (Reference #FRA02.196)       We believe the relief provided in this bill for interstate      bus companies with frozen pension plans, such as Greyhound,      is crucial to protect the affected employees' pension rights      and ensure the continued vitality of this nationwide      transportation system. With respect to the provisions      extending the thirty-year Treasury fix to 2001, we certainly      understand the need for and also support this provision.       As you know, ATU represents over 5,000 current Greyhound      employees, as well as 13,000 retirees. Greyhound and its      drivers serve over 4,000 communities nationwide, most of      which have no other form of intercity public transportation.      The continuance of these essential public transportation      services provided by Greyhound and its drivers, however, is      being threatened by federal pension funding requirements that      fail to recognize the uniqueness of the ATU-Greyhound pension      plan.       The jointly-administered defined benefit pension plan for      Greyhound bus drivers has been frozen to new participants      since 1983. The plan has 14,000 participants, all but 1,000      of which are retired. As a result, the average age of plan      participants is over 70 years, and their mortality rate is      far higher than that predicted by the mortality table that      current law requires the plan administrator to use in      determining funding requirements. Without legislative change,      this requirement will force Greyhound to make unnecessary      pension contributions with capita that is needed to operate      and maintain its vital nationwide transportation system and      to address new security threats facing the industry. These      changes will benefit our retirees and our active members as      well.       We applaud your leadership in the effort to provide this      necessary relief. As this is a top-priority for the ATU, I      want to personally thank you for all your efforts in this      matter. Please let us know how we can help you as this bill      moves forth.           Sincerely,                                                       Jim LaSala,                                          International President.                                 ______                                       By
