 President, I believe it is important that all Members of the Senate clearly understand the distribution of revenue aligned budget authority--that we called RABA--which the subcommittee integrated into this bill.  The philosophy of the Transportation Act for the 21st century was that highway funding is intrinsically linked to receipts to the highway account of the highway trust fund, and that increased gas tax receipts should be passed along to the States for highway construction and improvement projects.  The provision in TEA 21 that I described is a mechanism to guarantee additional revenue in the trust fund from greater than anticipated gas tax receipts would be spent for that purpose. The Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee's provision, which we have been talking about, ensures this intent is met and it is completely consistent with the spirit of TEA 21.  The President's budget submission, however, requested to divert a third of these funds away from the Federal aid highway program to fund other programs and their initiatives. The subcommittee rejected this approach. Instead, we adopted one that honors the commitment Congress made to the States when it passed TEA 21, which I supported along with others.  Our bill sends the funds directly to the States in order to maximize the Federal resources flowing to each State. I want to be clear this afternoon. This does not alter the TEA 21 formula. It, in fact, embraces the formula by strictly adhering to each State's individual guaranteed share under section 1105 of TEA 21.  This is one of those rare instances where Congress is able to put forward a proposal that benefits every Member in every State in the Union. Within a constrained Federal budget, it is an approach which increases the amount that is available to the States for highway construction. I believe it makes sense and at the proper time I believe my colleagues--I hope, at least, they will support it.
