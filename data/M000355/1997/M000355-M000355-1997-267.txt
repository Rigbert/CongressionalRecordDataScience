 President, let me say that we will get a sufficient second for a vote on this amendment. I am told by the Democratic Cloakroom that it would be permissible to have a couple of votes around 12:30, and it is my plan to have a vote on the Smith amendment at about 12:30.  I also understand under the previous agreement we are to vote on final passage on energy and water in juxtaposition to that vote.  Mr. President, is that correct?
