 President, I share many of my colleagues concerns about the need to do more to aid Colombia. But I also believe that our aid must be based on a clear and consistent plan, not on good intentions. We do Colombia no favors by throwing money at the problem. We do not help ourselves. Too often, throwing money at a problem is the same thing as throwing money away. For that reason, I, along with Senator Helms and Senator DeWine, am introducing legislation today calling on the U.S. Administration to present a plan.  Colombia is the third largest recipient of U.S. security aid behind Israel and Egypt. It is also the largest supplier of cocaine to the United States. But, we seem to find ourselves in the midst of a muddle. Our policy appears to be adrift, and our focus blurred.  This past Tuesday, the Caucus on International Narcotics Control held a hearing to ask the Administration for a specific plan and a detailed strategy outlining U.S. interests and priorities dealing with counter-narcotics efforts in Colombia. Before we in Congress get involved in a discussion about what and how much equipment we should be sending to Colombia, we need to discuss whether or not we should send any and why. Recent press reports indicate that the Administration is preparing a security assistance package to Colombia with funding from $500 million dollars to somewhere around $1.5 billion dollars.  And yet, Congress hasn't been able to evaluate any strategy. That's because there is none. From the hearing, it seems the Administration is incapable of thinking about the situation withany clarity or articulating a strategy with any transparency. It seems confused as to what is actually happening in Colombia.  At Tuesday's hearing, representatives from the Department of State and the Department of Defense assured me they were currently working on a detailed strategy to be unveiled at some future point. So far there have been difficulties in creating a detailed and coherent strategy and presenting it to Congress. Today we are introducing a bill that requires the Secretary of State to submit to Congress within 60 days a detailed report on current U.S. policy and strategy for counter-narcotics assistance for Colombia.  This is an issue that will not just simply disappear. Before we begin appropriating additional funding for Colombia, we need strategies and goals, not just piecemeal assistance and operations. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill.                                 ______                                       By
