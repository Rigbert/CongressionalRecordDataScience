 Speaker, it is an outrage that American workers must compete for jobs with as many as 200 million defenseless children working around the world today without any hope of ever seeing the inside of a classroom. Many of these abused children are making products exported for sale in our shopping malls, sporting goods stores, and oriental rug shops all across America. Even some of our Fourth of July fireworks were most probably made by children in India, China, and elsewhere.  Consider the plight of millions of child laborers, some as young as 4 years old, who are sold into virtual slavery, that is, bonded and indentured laborers, and chained to looms for 14-hours a day hand knotting the oriental rugs that grace the foyers and living rooms of countless homes and offices all across our country.  Exploited children toil in factories, mines, fields, at looms, and even in brothels, sacrificing their youth, health, and innocence for little or no wages.  They are hand-stitching the Nike and Adidas soccer balls that our kids practice with every day. The very same soccer balls that were used at the Atlanta Olympics last year.  They are sewing the blouses and slacks that Kathie Lee Gifford was paid $7 million a year to promote for Wal-Mart stores until she was embarrassed last year.  They are making Mattel Barbie dolls that little girls all across America play with every day.  Sadly it took Kathie Lee's embarrassment in the national media last year for many Americans to confront this dirty little secret of the global marketplace: millions of Americans are buying soccer balls, toys, and clothing for our own kids that are made by brutally exploited children in many of the foreign countries with which we have growing trade deficits.  This situation is totally unacceptable and there are actions we can take to stop this affront to basic human decency.  That is why I am sponsoring legislation--the Bonded Child Labor Elimination Act--to prohibit the importing of any products made by child slaves.  This bill deals with one of the most outrageous forms of exploitation in international trade today--imports made by bonded children who are sold into slavery, some as young as 3 years old.  It would amend the Tariff Act of 1930 which for decades has banned the importing of products into America that are made by adult prison or forced labor. It would simply extend that ban to products made by bonded child labor.  I firmly believe trade is not an end in itself, but a means toward attaining more economic justice, social responsibility, and environmental sustainability in the U.S. and the global economy.  To knee-jerk free traders, I say that hundreds of millions of children working in hazardous jobs in back alleys instead of going to school is unacceptable.  That these defenseless, exploited children should be forced to work under brutal conditions that can kill or maim them for life is outrageous.  That most adults turn a blind eye to this cruelty and provide a market for this suffering is inexcusable.  The fact that current trade rules at the GATT and World Trade Organization go to great lengths to protect property rights, while ignoring the rights of working people, especially children, says much more about the heartless priorities and greed of doctrinaire free trade advocates than their logic and ethics.  Inside and outside the halls of Government, we have the power to change this sorry state of affairs. Access to the American marketplace is powerful leverage that should be used to encourage foreign producers and importers to treat defenseless children with dignity and not contempt.  We cannot accept any longer the shameful, outdated trade policies that force American workers to compete with exploited children. Ask yourself this question: what does it say about our country that we have numerous import laws and consumer campaigns to protect endangered plants and animals, but we have no law or consumer campaigns to protect children consigned to practical slavery?  Some teenagers in Vermont have already begun to speak out and demand action in defense of kids overseas who cannot help themselves. I applaud their human rights leadership and hope more of you will report on their efforts and get involved yourselves.                          ____________________
