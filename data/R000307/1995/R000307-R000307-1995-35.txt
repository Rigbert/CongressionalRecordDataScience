Chairman, reserving the right to object, everyone else objected this evening, I just thought it was my turn. Under my reservation, I would like to ask the distinguished gentleman from New Mexico what the arrangement is in regard to the many amendments we have pending, and of course the very important amendment by the two gentlemen who are not on the Authorizing Committee and not on the Appropriations Committee, but must have 1 hour of debate and an immediate vote as opposed to the 10 or 15 or 20 other votes that affect policy, but we are going to debate them tonight, not have votes, roll them over into the next day so nobody will know what they are voting on.  Mr. Chairman, is that the business of the committee?
