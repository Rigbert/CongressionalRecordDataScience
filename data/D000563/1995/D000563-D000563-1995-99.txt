Mr. Chairman, that is why the amendment should be so clear and noncontroversial. If you want to stand for the proposition that the EPA should not protect our families from cancer-causing substances, then vote ``no'' on this amendment. If you believe that they should protect us from these unseen dangers in water and air, vote ``yes.'' Simple and easy.  So why is it complicated today? Because certain lobbyists and special interest groups want to play fast and loose with cancer-causing standards and lead contamination. They want to fudge a little. They want to change the standard. They can make more money if they do. Should we let them? I do not think so. That is why I am offering the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
