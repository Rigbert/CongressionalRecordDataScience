                           Amendment No. 13  Madam President, I join Chairwoman Cantwell, the chair of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, and the senior Senator from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, in opposing Senator Coburn's amendment. The amendment will remove essential protections for Native women from the bill.  Native women in this country experience domestic abuse at a shockingly high rate. A recent study found that nearly three in five American Indian women have been the victim of a domestic assault. This terrible trend has been perpetuated by a jurisdictional gap that allows many non-Indian perpetrators on tribal lands to go unpunished.  This problem is real: nearly half of Indian women are married to non-Indian men, and thousands more are in relationships with non-Indians. Tribal courts have no jurisdiction when these men commit domestic violence offenses, and federal and state officials are not in a position to prosecute in most cases. They are often hours away and lack the resources and local contacts to be able to effectively respond. These non-Indian men can essentially abuse Indian women with immunity from any consequences. That has to end.  The Leahy-Crapo bill addresses this glaring need by allowing tribes that can provide key rights to defendants to prosecute non-Indians for domestic violence offenses under limited circumstances. Our bill also clarifies that tribal courts have the authority to issue and enforce protection orders against non-Indians. These are essential tools in combatting domestic violence. Senator Coburn's amendment would eliminate these crucial provisions.  These provisions in the Leahy-Crapo bill are the product of careful deliberation by the Indian Affairs Committee and the Judiciary Committee, with input from legal experts. They are identical to the corresponding provision in last year's VAWA reauthorization which passed the Senate with 68 votes. Just this week I received a letter from the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence Against Women voicing their strong support for the tribal jurisdiction provision that is currently in the Leahy-Crapo bill and today I received their letter strongly opposing the changes proposed in Senator Coburn's amendment. I also received a letter from the National Congress of American Indians expressing their support for the current tribal provisions and unequivocal opposition to any efforts to alter them.  Senator Coburn's amendment would reverse the significant progress we made last year when the Senate passed these provisions with strong bipartisan support. It sends the message that Native women are not deserving of the same protections as other women. I urge my fellow Senators to vote against it.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that these letters and other letters opposing the amendment be pritned in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence            Against Women,                                                 February 6, 2013.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chair, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office          Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Michael Crapo,     Dirksen Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Crapo: The National Task      Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence--comprised of      national, tribal, state, territorial and local organizations,      as well as individuals, committed to securing an end to      violence against women, including civil rights organizations,      labor unions, advocates for children and youth, anti-poverty      groups, immigrant and refugee rights organizations, women's      rights leaders, and education groups--writes to express its      strong and unequivocal support for the tribal provisions      included in Title IX of S. 47, the Violence Against Women      Reauthorization Act. As you are aware, these provisions are      identical to those that were contained in S. 1925, the VAWA      bill introduced in the 112th Congress. As such, the      provisions were first voted affirmatively out of the Indian      Affairs Committee, then added to S. 1925 and passed out of      the Judiciary Committee, and finally were contained in the      final version of S. 1925 that passed the Senate last year      with bipartisan support.       While we understand that some have expressed constitutional      concerns with respect to the criminal jurisdiction provisions      contained in section 904, Title IX of S. 47, we wish to      respectfully point out that the provisions were drafted and      put forward by the U.S. Department of Justice, and were      thoroughly vetted before they were submitted to the Senate      Indian Affairs and Judiciary Committees. We also wish to      remind the members of the Senate of the terrifying rates of      victimization that American Indian and Alaska Native women      experience: 34% of American Indian and Alaska Native women      will be raped in their lifetimes, 39% will be subjected to      domestic violence in their lifetimes. Sixty-seven percent of      Native women victims of rape and sexual assault report that      their assailants are non-Native individuals. On some      reservations, Native women are murdered at more than ten      times the national average. These startling statistics,      coupled with the unfortunately high declination rates (U.S.      Attorneys declined to prosecute nearly 52% of violent crimes      that occur in Indian country, and 67% of cases declined were      sexual abuse related cases), provided ample reason for      Congress to act in passing S. 47 with Section 904 intact.       Additonally, we offer for the consideration of the members      of the Senate a letter submitted last year by over 50 U.S.      law professors who carefully reviewed the provisions of      section 904 and found them to be constitutional. We offer      some relevant excerpts below:       ``It is important to note that Section 904 of S. 1925 does      not constitute a full restoration of all tribal criminal      jurisdiction--only that which qualifies as ``special domestic      violence criminal jurisdiction.'' So there must be an      established intimate-partner relationship to trigger the      jurisdiction. Moreover, no defendant in tribal court will be      denied Constitutional rights that would be afforded in state      or federal courts. Section 904 provides ample safeguards to      ensure that non-Indian defendants in domestic violence cases      receive all rights guaranteed by the United States      Constitution. .  .  .       In other words, a defendant who has no ties to the tribal      community would not be subject to criminal prosecution in      tribal court. Federal courts have jurisdiction to review such      tribal jurisdiction determinations after exhaustion of tribal      remedies. Section 904 is specifically tailored to address the      victimization of Indian women by persons who have either      married a citizen of the tribe or are dating a citizen of the      Tribe.''       In closing, the National Task Force wishes to thank you for      your tireless efforts to reauthorize the Violence Against      Women Act, S. 47. We appreciate your leadership and look      forward to working with you toward a speedy passage of S. 47,      including Title IX as introduced with no weakening      amendments.           Sincerely,     The National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence.                                  ____         NCAI Task Force on Violence Against Women, National            Congress of American Indians,                                 Washington, DC, February 7, 2013.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chair, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office          Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Michael Crapo,     Dirksen Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Leahy and Crapo: The National Congress of      American Indians (NCAI), founded in 1944, is the oldest,      largest and most representative American Indian and Alaska      Native organization serving the broad interests of tribal      governments and communities. The NCAI Task Force on Violence      Against Women focuses on addressing crimes of violence      against Native women. This letter is to express our strong      opposition to any amendment offered which would strip or      alter the current language in S. 47.       The Task Force knows that unfortunately Native women are      victimized at rates higher than any other population in the      United States. It is estimated that 34% of American Indian      and Alaska Native women will be raped in their lifetimes; 39%      will be subjected to domestic violence in their lifetimes;      67% of Native women victims of rape and sexual assault report      their assailants as non-Native individuals, and, on some      reservations, Native women are murdered at more than ten      times the national average.       These startling statistics, coupled with the unfortunately      high declination rates (U.S. Attorneys declined to prosecute      nearly 52% of violent crimes that occur in Indian country;      and 67% of cases declined were sexual abuse related cases),      provide ample reason for Congress to act in passing S. 47      with Section 904 intact.       Section 904 does not take away constitutional rights from      offenders, it guarantees swift justice for Native victims.      There are safeguards built into the provision which ensure      that all rights guaranteed under the Constitution are given      to non-Native defendants in tribal court. Further, the      special domestic violence jurisdiction is narrowly restricted      to apply only to instances of domestic or dating violence      where: 1) the victim is an Indian, 2) the conduct occurs on      tribal lands; and 3) where the defendant either lives or      works on the reservation, i.e., where the defendant has      significant ties to the community.       The NCAI Task Force on Violence Against Women is extremely      concerned that misunderstandings of the political status of      Indian tribes and the internal workings of the tribal court      system are causing confusion on how this provision will work      on the ground. Indian tribes are not a racial class, they are      a political body--so the question is not whether non-Indians      are subject to Indian court--the question is whether tribal      governments, political entities, have the necessary      jurisdiction to provide their citizens with the public safety      protections every government has the inherent duty to      provide.       Amendments which place more funding in the hands of federal      authorities will not address this immediate local need. We      believe strongly that local government is the best government      for addressing public safety concerns. For example, an      amendment is being offered today which would require that      tribal governments petition a U.S. District Court for an      ``appropriately tailored protection order excluding any      persons from areas within the Indian country of the tribe.''      This level of procedure for an intimately local issue is not      practical and will do little to improve matters on Indian      reservations. Tribal courts are the appropriate venue to      issue such protection orders.       Also, tribal courts and authorities are the appropriate      triers of fact for domestic violence matters conducted on      Indian reservations. The federal system has proven      ineffective in many respects, but none as detrimental to the      backbone of a community as the area of domestic violence      against Native women. Further many tribal courts operate in      much the same manner as state courts, albeit with smaller      dockets and lesser degrees of crime as their sister      governments: state and federal courts. Also, all tribal      courts are bound by the Indian Civil Rights Act, which, as      amended, guarantees all of the constitutional rights non-     Native defendants have in state courts.       For these reasons, the NCAI Task Force on Violence Against      Women strongly opposes any amendments to S. 47 and offers its      strong support for the current language in the bipartisan      Senate VAWA Reauthorization: S. 47. Thanks for your time and      your continuous efforts to provide greater protections for      women in Indian Country.           Sincerely,                                            Juana Majel Dixon,                             Co-Chair, NCAI Task Force on Violence                                                    Against Women.                                                  Terri Henry,                             Co-Chair, NCAI Task Force on Violence     Against Women.                                  ____                    Vote No on Coburn Amendment #13   A ``NO'' Vote will Retain Vital VAWA Protections for Native Women       The National Congress of American Indians and tribal      governments nationwide oppose Coburn Amendment No. 13. This      harmful amendment would strip the critical tribal      jurisdiction provisions in Sections 904 and 905 of S. 47 that      are so important to deterring senseless violence against      Native women who reside on Indian reservations. Section 904      is the same tribal jurisdiction language that passed the      Senate last session with strong bi-partisan support. It      acknowledges the authority of Indian tribal governments to      exercise concurrent jurisdiction over crimes of domestic      violence by non-Native suspects. Every suspect will be      afforded the full array of constitutional protections.     This provision is critically important to stopping the      epidemic of domestic violence against Native women.     Section 904 is Narrowly Tailored       Section 904 does not acknowledge blanket jurisdiction over      all crimes committed by non-Indians on tribal lands. The      jurisdiction would only apply to domestic or dating violence      where the victim is a tribal citizen; the crime occurred on      tribal lands; and the defendant must be in an established      relationship with the victim. The provision is specifically      tailored to address a serious epidemic of violence that      Native women face each day.       The current system of justice on Indian lands is broken.      More than 1 in 3 Native women will be raped in their      lifetimes, and more than 3 in 5 will suffer domestic abuse.      Native women are forced to rely on federal officials to      investigate and prosecute domestic violence committed by non-     Natives. However, U.S. Attorneys declined to prosecute a      majority of violent crimes. Between 2006-2009, federal      officials declined 52% of violent reservation crimes,      including 67% of sexual assaults.       In most cases, federal resources are stretched too thin,      and federal investigators are located too far from many      reservations to serve as an effective deterrent to crime on      tribal lands. Lower level crimes of domestic violence go      completely unprosecuted--and often unreported, because many      Native women have lost faith in the justice system. When      lower level domestic violence goes unpunished, the violence      increases. The result on some reservations is that the      homicide rate of Native women in 10 times the national      average. These shocking facts provide compelling reasons for      Congress to enact S. 47 with Section 904 intact.     Defendants' Have all Due Process Rights under the Proposed          Limited Jurisdiction       Section 904 ensures that non-Indian defendants in tribal      court are afforded due process in a manner consistent with      state and federal courts. This includes the right to      effective assistance of counsel, the right to a trial by an      impartial jury selected impartially, as well as all other      constitutional rights guaranteed under the Indian Civil      Rights Act. Also, the draft language includes a catch-all      provision, which entitles defendants to ``all other rights      whose protection is necessary under the Constitution of the      United States in order for Congress'' to acknowledge this      jurisdiction. This last section ensures that non-Indian      defendants will receive a fair trial in tribal courts. The U.      S. Department of Justice developed and strongly supports      Section 904, as do Bush Administration U.S. Attorneys, and      many other experts in the field of criminal justice.     The Coburn Amendment Also Strikes Section 905 from S. 47       The Coburn Amendment would strike Section 905 from S. 47.      This section also passed this Senate last session with strong      bi-partisan support. The civil jurisdiction found in Section      905 already exists under the full faith & credit clauses of      VAWA 2000. This section simply clarifies the intent of this      earlier reauthorization by making clear that tribes have full      civil authority to issue and enforce domestic civil      protection orders against Indians and non-Indians alike.       This provision is critical to strengthening tribal      regulatory authority over domestic disputes, threats of      violence, harassment, or verbal or physical abuse. Women      living in Indian country and Alaska Native villages rely on      tribal courts each day to obtain civil orders of protection      to prevent future abuse in crimes of domestic violence,      sexual assault, dating, and stalking. Requiring a woman in      need of immediate protection to travel hundreds of miles from      her reservation to a state court is not only impractical but      also dangerous. We strongly oppose any amendment intended to      strike this provision.     A Vote Against the Coburn Amendment is a Vote for Indian          Country       A vote against the Coburn Amendment is a vote for Native      women victims of abuse--and for the children who will grow up      without such horrific violence. Sections 904 and 905 are      sensible, fair and will create a partnership between tribal      governments and federal authorities in addressing an epidemic      of domestic violence in Indian country. A VAWA      Reauthorization without these critical provisions will deny      Indian women access to justice and legal protection available      to other victims. Native women will be left behind in the      national efforts to protect all victims of domestic violence      and sexual assault.       Coburn Amendment No. 13 would ignore the horrific crime      that Native women face on a daily basis. If adopted, Congress      will be telling tribal communities that the status quo is      acceptable. Violence against any person by any person      anywhere is unacceptable. For these reasons, I respectfully      request you oppose the Coburn Amendment No. 13 and help      Indian Country pass a VAWA Reauthorization that protects all      women.

Re Stand up for Native Women--Vote No on Coburn Amendment          (No. 13) to S. 47.     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: I write to you in two roles. First, I write      on behalf of the United South and Eastern Tribes, Inc.      (USET), which is an inter-tribal organization representing 26      federally recognized Tribes from Texas to Maine. Second, I      write as a son, father, relative and tribal leader who has      seen all too many times the long-lasting tragic consequences      of domestic abuse within our communities. It burns our hearts      that many of the perpetrators, despite having close ties to      our tribal lands and communities, have no fear of punishment      because they are non-Indians and therefore fall outside the      jurisdiction of the local government--in this case, the      tribal government.       Please support S. 47 and oppose any efforts, including the      Coburn amendment (No. 13), which would deprive tribal      governments of critically needed authority to keep      reservations safe and protect Native women and other victims      of domestic abuse.       I have been taught that ``no nation is truly defeated until      the hearts of its women are on the ground.'' Native women      have strong hearts, but that strength is constantly      challenged by the high rates of domestic violence on many      Indian reservations. Of course, domestic violence is not      limited to women and it is not limited to adults. It has an      effect that passes down through the generations. We all dream      that our children can live and grow up in a safe place, with      loving adults. From such a foundation, our children will      create safe and healthy families of their own, free from the      scourge of domestic violence. It is well known that domestic      violence is a behavior that starts at one level and often      escalates over time to serious injury or even death. Tribes      need the authority to intervene in early incidences of      domestic violence, as well as at any other stage. Only by      doing this can we break the chain of domestic violence that      weighs down our communities.       The pending Violence Against Women Act (VAWA)      reauthorization (S. 47) presents an extraordinary opportunity      to address the startling lack of law enforcement response to,      and prosecutions for, incidences of domestic violence on      Indian reservations. After years of struggling with this      issue, those of us who live in Indian country have realized      that the answer does not lie with the Federal and state      governments, but with ourselves. We need to have in place      systems of justice that will put fear in the heart of those      who consider evil deeds, while also assure that all members      of our communities have their basic rights protected. To do      this, our Tribal courts must have authority to exercise      limited domestic violence criminal jurisdiction over all      individuals with close ties to tribal communities who commit      domestic violence offenses on Indian lands. Only at the local      level can we create the credible community expectations and      standards that will significantly reduce this crisis.       There have been calls for alternate answers to the issue of      domestic violence in Indian Country, but we who live there      and know the problem first-hand can see no solution, short of      tribal jurisdiction over domestic violence crimes, that will      truly deter predators and assure justice for domestic      violence victims. Indeed, the solution we seek--acknowledging      and strengthening the power of local jurisdictions to respond      to local problems--is one that is common throughout the      country to address issues of crime and violence and achieve      justice in the most effective manner possible.       From many conversations with both Republican and Democratic      Members of the Senate, I know that we all care deeply about      our family, friends, and loved ones and that we all want to      stop the scourge of domestic violence. In this, we have a      common humanity which rises above philosophical and political      differences. We appeal to the leadership and membership of      the Senate on the grounds of this shared humanity to reach a      compassionate solution that extends the most basic of legal      protections to all victims of domestic violence, no matter      where in the United States they happen to live, and that      empowers Tribal communities to enforce these values on their      lands.       In addition to opposing the Coburn Amendment (No. 13), USET      would urge you to support the Murkowski Amendment, which      provides important clarifications for Native Alaskans and the      Leahy Human Trafficking Amendment.           Respectfully,                                                  Brian Patterson,                                                        President.
