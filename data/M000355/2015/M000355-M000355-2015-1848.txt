 President, let me say first that I want to welcome back our colleague, the minority leader. He has had a challenging month. We are happy to see him back here in the Senate. We wish him well in his recovery, which looks as if it is coming along nicely.  Welcome back, I say on behalf of all of our colleagues to the Democratic leader.                          ____________________
