Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma, and I just wish to state for the record that the Food and Nutrition Service, which is in another account, was conducting some of its own evaluations for a number of years, and the committee felt that a more objective set of evaluations could be done through the Economic Research Service. That is the reason that these funds are in this account, because essentially we have transferred responsibilities from the Food and Nutrition Service to the Economic Research Service.  This is a new function, in a sense, for the Economic Research Service, but we believe with their objectivity they could do a good job of evaluating the two-thirds to three-quarters, actually three-quarters of this budget that is in the mandatory programs, including our major food and nutrition programs.  So I think the gentleman expressed some concern that there were funds in here providing for research, but the point is they are not being provided in the Food and Nutrition Service any more. These responsibilities have been shifted to the Economic Research Service.  So I wanted to state that for the record and to state that we hope that the Economic Research Service will do their job well. We certainly have had waste, fraud and abuse in many of the food and nutrition programs, and we have been going after that through the Inspector General, I think who is doing a tremendous job at USDA in particular, and I would hope that the evaluations that would be done would continue to show progress.  So I would not support the gentleman's amendment because I think it is a rather arbitrary and ill-advised cut.
