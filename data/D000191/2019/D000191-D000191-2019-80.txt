Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  The gentleman referred to trucks. Actually, we are talking about very small quantities in special containers, not massive rail tank cars holding these amounts.  Another thing is that there is no known company. You can't contact them. There is no publicly available contact information, no headquarters, but they have petitioned and they are going through a special permit process with--the gentleman says there is going to be public review and input--sure--to move six trains a day with 100 cars in each one, essentially, a liquid pipeline through these heavily populated areas.  We saw what happened at Lac-Megantic up in Canada with just crude oil in tank cars killing dozens of people, obliterating a town. This is 10 times more powerful than that.  Yet the gentleman from Florida is advocating that this should happen in Florida, and the people living all along the Brightline--Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood, the President at Mar-a-Lago--just shouldn't worry their sweet little heads about it: It won't be a target of terrorists; there won't be an accident; it is never going to happen. Well, we have heard that before.  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
