President, I yield an extra 5 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey, especially because of the tremendous work he has done along with the Senator from Florida, Mr. Mack, on this subject. I think they have had to overcome so many obstacles and so many mysterious holds on their legislation. I, of course, yield 5 more minutes to the Senator.
