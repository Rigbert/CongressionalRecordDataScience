 President, I would like to tell my colleagues in the Senate about a project I worked on in Iowa on getting history from various veterans.  This morning, I delivered 20 stories from veterans to the Veterans History Project at our Library of Congress. These stories will be preserved in the permanent collection of the Library of Congress, making accessible the personal accounts of American war veterans so that future generations may hear directly from veterans and better understand the realities of war.  I want to thank all of our veterans, including those who were interviewed, who have sacrificed for the defense of our freedoms. Their service ensures that all Americans will live in peace and prosperity for generations to come.                          ____________________
