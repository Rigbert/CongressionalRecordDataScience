President, it is my understanding, for clarification--because we have changed this a little bit--that our final decision is we are going to have an hour and a half kind of equally divided for those of us who are for overriding the veto, and then after that there will be an hour and a half for the other side, and we can divide our time as we want since we are agreeing on this. Is that correct?
