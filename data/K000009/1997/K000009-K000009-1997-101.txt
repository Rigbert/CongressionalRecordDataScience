Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Alabama [Mr. Callahan], our good friend, for the cooperation that he has exhibited since the time that we were in the subcommittee and the full committee, it truly is appreciated, and for his remarks concerning his report language amendment in full committee.                             {time}   1500  I concur with his assessment that the report language he references has no standing since there is no funding in the Cooperative State Research Facilities account.  I would like to note for the Record that the subcommittee received numerous, numerous requests from Members on both sides of the aisle for funding for research buildings, and I am sure that all these proposals have merit, and should funding be made available in this account, I would expect that each proposal that qualifies for these funds would be judged on their merits.  Mr. Chairman, I also want to say that I thank the gentleman and supported his amendment, especially because it is done within the context of the additional money that was included within the subcommittee allocation. So it is within the budget constraints that we are forced to abide by, and I want to thank the gentleman for working with us on this and we accept his amendment.
