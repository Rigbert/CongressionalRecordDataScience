 We made a major effort. Senator Grassley and Senator Enzi, the two ranking members of the relevant committees, as well as Senator Snowe, were in endless discussions with the majority. Then it became clear that they were not interested in doing anything short of this massive restructuring of one-sixth of our economy, which includes, as the Senator indicated--we expressed our concerns early about these $\1/2\ trillion cuts in Medicare to start a program for someone else.  I would go so far as to suggest the reason the public's reaction to this has been so severe is because they have chosen such a partisan route. Had they chosen a different route, had we produced a bill in the middle, a bill much more modest in its intention rather than this audacious restructuring, the American people would see us behind it and they would be behind it.  By choosing this sort of narrow ``my way or the highway'' approach, ``we are going to get the 60 votes and jam you,'' they have made it impossible to make this a proposal that they could sell to the American people.  The American people are not foolish. The difference between this issue and most issues is everybody cares about health care regardless of age. The older you get the more you care about it, but everybody cares about health care. But they are paying attention and they see that this is not in any way a bipartisan proposal. So they have created for themselves not only a terrible bill, in my judgment, that should not pass and probably will not pass, but an enormous political problem for themselves along the way that would have been entirely avoidable had they chosen a different route from the beginning.
