Chairman, I yield \1/2\ minute to myself.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the Kaptur-Schaffer amendment and to maintain levels of funding for Ukraine. Help Ukraine move toward reform, especially in memory of the slain journalists. Many of those independent journalists would want us to help their cause inside Ukraine. Do not walk away from her now.  Mr. Chairman, I want to also express my great appreciation to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe), the chairman of the subcommittee, for allowing this discussion to ensue this afternoon, for the serious manner with which he has dealt with those who do not share his position, and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey) for her graciousness as we move this amendment forward.                              {time}  1845
