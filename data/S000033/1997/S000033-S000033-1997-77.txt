 Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  What we are trying to do in a bipartisan way is to provide $5 million to some of the weakest and most vulnerable people in this country, senior citizens who are in need of nutrition but are too weak to get out of their own homes to get it, and we are taking that money from the salary and expense account of the FDA. I think it is the proper thing to do.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
