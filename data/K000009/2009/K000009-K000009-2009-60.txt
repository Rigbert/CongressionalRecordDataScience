Finally, America is moving forward, and I want to thank our able chairman, John Spratt, for doing what the American people want us to do. They've told us they can't wait anymore.  This budget resolution addresses the necessity for our Nation to reduce its crippling and dangerous dependence on foreign oil. We must produce our own energy and do so through sustainable, renewable sources, while creating jobs here in America. Our people cannot wait.  We must re-imagine and re-tool America's energy economy. Alternative energy technologies provide one clear path to industrial growth and local employment. Our people cannot wait.  This Congress started with the Obama Recovery Act which set our ship of State on a new path forward to spur development and production of new energy sources and technologies. Our people cannot wait.  And this budget resolution includes a further commitment to renewable energy and energy efficiency. Especially through the deficit neutral energy fund, we will encourage and engage communities to emit fewer greenhouse gases and develop alternative energy technologies and production to create jobs in a new energy age.  The resolution not only helps our Nation recover, it focuses on cutting the deficit in half by 2013 through all the efficiencies and establishes a balance between investing in key areas to grow our economy and saving in order to help put our Nation on a growth path forward.  We are asking this of our citizens, are we not? And we should ask no less of our government. Our people cannot wait.  I rise in strong support of the resolution, and I thank my colleague for yielding.
