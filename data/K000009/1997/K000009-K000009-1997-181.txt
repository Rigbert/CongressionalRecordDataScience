The Clerk read as follows:       Amendment offered by Ms. Kaptur:       Page 48, insert the following after line 21:       ``(C) An application filed by a small business concern      entitled to reduced fees under section 41(h)(1) of this      title, by an individual who is an independent inventor      entitled to reduced fees under such section, or by an      institution of higher education (as defined in section 1202      of the Higher Education Act of 1965) entitled to reduced fees      under such section 41(h)(1) shall not be published until a      patent is issued thereon, except upon the request of      applicant, or in any of the following circumstances:       ``(i) In the case of an application under section 111(a)      for a patent for an invention for which the applicant intends      to file or has filed an application for a patent in a foreign      country, the Commissioner may publish, at the discretion of      the Commissioner and by means determined suitable for the      purpose, no more than that data from such application under      section 111(a) which will be made or has been made public in      such foreign country. Such a publication shall be made only      after the date of the publication in such foreign country and      shall be made only if the data is not available, or cannot be      made readily available, in the English language through      commercial services.       ``(ii) If the Commissioner determines that a patent      application which is filed after the date of the enactment of      this paragraph--       ``(I) has been pending more than 5 years from the effective      filing date of the application,       ``(II) has not been previously published by the Patent and      Trademark Office,       ``(III) is not under any appellate review by the Board of      Patent Appeals and Interferences,       ``(IV) is not under interference proceedings in accordance      with section 135(a),       ``(V) is not under any secrecy order pursuant to section      181,       ``(VI) is not being diligently pursued by the applicant in      accordance with this title, and       ``(VII) is not in abandonment,     the Commissioner shall notify the applicant of such      determination.       ``(iii) An applicant which received notice of a      determination described in clause (ii) may, within 30 days of      receiving such notice, petition the Commissioner to review      the determination to verify that subclauses (I) through (VII)      are all applicable to the applicant's application. If the      applicant makes such a petition, the Commissioner shall not      publish the applicant's application before the Commissioner's      review of the petition is completed. If the applicant does      not submit a petition, the Commissioner may publish the      applicant's application no earlier than 90 days after giving      such a notice.       ``(iv) If after the date of the enactment of this paragraph      a continuing application has been filed more than 6 months      after the date of the initial filing of an application, the      Commissioner shall notify the applicant under such      application. The Commissioner shall establish a procedure for      an applicant which receives such a notice to demonstrate that      the purpose of the continuing application was for reasons      other than to achieve a delay in the time of publication of      the application. If the Commissioner agrees with such a      demonstration by the applicant, the Commissioner shall not      publish the applicant's application. If the Commissioner does      not agree with such a demonstration by the applicant or if      the applicant does not make an attempt at such a      demonstration within a reasonable period of time as      determined by the Commissioner, the Commissioner shall      publish the applicant's application.
