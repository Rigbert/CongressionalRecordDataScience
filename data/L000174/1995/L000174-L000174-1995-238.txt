 Madam President, I do not want to stop the Senator from bringing this or any other amendment up, unless it is something that requires a point of order. But we have one amendment pending, and that was set aside to take up an amendment by the distinguished Republican leader. I would like to start getting some of these things that are backed up here voted on one way or the other. I would like to get the humanitarian one done and then go to others.  I say that only because I am afraid we will keep having amendments after amendments out here in ether and about 9 o'clock or 10 o'clock tonight when everybody will be coming to the distinguished Senator from Kentucky and myself saying, ``When will we go home? on the outside chance we will see our family again,'' and then we start voting.  I know that is not the intent of the distinguished Senator from North Carolina, but I wonder if maybe we could get rid of the one that is there once the Senators who wish to speak on it do, and then go on to more.  I know that an objection was made by the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, and I will at least for the moment--I am sure the Senator from North Carolina understands we have to protect that objection.
