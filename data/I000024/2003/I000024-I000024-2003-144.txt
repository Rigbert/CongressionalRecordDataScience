We know there are some plans out there that have been offered that take into consideration that we do not want one Government program that is going to end up being an entitlement program. If it ends up the way it is today, I am going to serve notice right now that after every effort we can make to pass amendments, if they do not work and we end up with what we have today, I am going to be opposing this plan, and hopefully there will be several others who will do the same thing.                               Exhibit 1                          Medicare Drug Folly       Runaway trains are hard to stop, but someone has to try and      derail the bipartisan folly now moving ahead under the guise      of Medicare ``reform.'' Permit us to put a few facts on the      table, in the (probably fanciful) hope that somebody in the      White House still cares more about the long-run policy than      the short-term politics.       Let's start with the amusing irony that the supporters of      this giant new prescription drug benefit are many of the same      folks who were only recently moaning that a $350 billion tax      cut would break the budget. That tax cut will at least help      the economy grow. But the new Medicare entitlement is nothing      more than a wealth transfer (from younger workers to      retirees) estimated to cost $400 billion over 10 years, and      everyone knows even that is understated.       The real pig in the Medicare python doesn't hit until the      Baby Boomers retire. Social Security and Medicare Trustee Tom      Saving told us last week that the ``present value'' of the      Senate plan--the value of the entire future obligation in      today's dollars--is something like two-thirds the size of the      current $3.8 trillion in debt held by the public.       Bill Clinton's Medicare administrator, Nancy-Ann DeParle,      correctly calls it the ``biggest expansion of government      health benefits since the Great Society.'' She's delighted to      see it, but for the rest of us it is a recipe for tax      increases as far as the eye can see.       And these estimates are before Democrats ``improve'' the      benefit, as they are already agitating to do. That's because      the dirty secret of this bipartisan lovefest is that the      proposed drug benefit isn't all that great.     The bill that passed the Senate Finance Committee last week      would cover just 50% of drug expenses between $276 and $4,500      annually, then zero up to $5,800, and 90% thereafter.       That's nowhere near as good as many seniors currently have      with employer-sponsored coverage. Most employers will drop or      scale back that coverage once they realize that the feds are      willing to pick up part of their tab. The Congressional      Budget Office estimates that 37% of those with employer      coverage could lose it.       A Goldman Sachs analyst last week called this bill the      ``automaker enrichment act,'' saying companies like Ford and      GM would see a 15% reduction in their annual drug spending      and a huge decrease in unfunded liabilities. So unborn      taxpayers will soon have to pick up the tab for sweetheart      labor deals negotiated by carmakers and their unions a      generation or two ago.       Understood in these terms, a universal drug benefit is      neither necessary nor morally justifiable. Some 76% of      seniors already have some prescription drug coverage, as the      nearby chart shows. The average Medicare beneficiary spends      an affordable $999 a year out of pocket on prescription      drugs, and less than 5% have out of pocket expenses over      $4,000.       Seniors already own 60% of all the wealth in this country,      and are getting richer. A report in Health Affairs estimates      that by 2030 about half will have incomes of $40,000 and      about 60% will have assets of $200,000 or more. We're all for      a prosperous old age, but it is hardly a step toward social      justice for comfortable retirees to be further subsidized by      working taxpayers with mortgages and kids. The problem of      genuinely poor seniors can be handled with a drug discount      card or a means-tested subsidy.       We understand, of course, that these facts are unlikely to      interfere with the political calculus driving this giant step      toward Canadian health care. The Democrats want to expand the      welfare state, while Republicans have convinced themselves      that they'll get credit with seniors and be able to take      health care off the table for 2004.       The Republicans are fooling themselves in the long run, and      perhaps even about next year. Republicans can never win an      entitlement bidding war. They will spend the rest of their      public lives sounding like Scrooge for not expanding      benefits, or raising taxes on their own voters to pay for the      subsidies, or imposing price controls on drug makers that      will stifle innovation. This is how parties of the right      became me-too socialists in Europe.       The sheepish support for this from the likes of otherwise      conservative Senators Rick Santorum and Mitch McConnell gives      the game away. They're playing loyal spinners, but their      heart doesn't seem to be in it. They're going along for the      ride with a Republican White House that seems to have      forgotten that it has an obligation to more than its own re-     election.
