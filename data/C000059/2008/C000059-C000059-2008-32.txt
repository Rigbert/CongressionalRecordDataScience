Corona has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. John Couts is one of these individuals. On May 17, 2008, John will be recognized at the Corona-Norco Family YMCA's 13th Anniversary Distinguished Service Awards Dinner and will receive the YMCA Distinguished Service Award.  John Couts is President of Couts Heating and Cooling, Inc., a mechanical contracting company that has operated in Corona for thirty years. Cents Heating and Cooling, established in 1978, owes its long-standing success to its simple, yet driving business philosophy: honesty, integrity, and putting the best interest of the customer first. Couts Heating and Cooling, Inc. is a Union Contractor providing heating, ventilating and air-conditioning services in addition to mechanical piping and energy management controls to commercial, industrial, medical and educational facilities.  The story of Couts Heating and Cooling is a small business success story that began with a team of four family members and a determination to succeed. From their entrepreneurial beginnings, the business has evolved into a major corporation, employing 200 people. A major component of the growth of Couts Heating and Cooling has been their unwavering commitment to family-owned values.  John's life has been woven into the fabric of the City of Corona for more than three decades. He and his wife, Carolyn, raised and educated two daughters in Corona. For many years both Carolyn and John were active in booster and fundraising activities for cheerleading and athletics, spending countless hours supporting their daughters' endeavors. As their children grew into their own lives, John's contributions to the community evolved from school and athletic events into community causes.  John currently sits on the Board of the Foundation for Community and Family Healthy were he has been instrumental in spearheading and promoting an annual giving program that will provide long-term funding for the Foundation's countless outreach programs. As a business owner, not only has John been extremely active in industry and trade associations at a local and state level, he has also been a member and active supporter of the Corona Chamber of Commerce. For the past eight months, John has shared his professional expertise as a member of a selectively chosen group of business owners who comprise the Chamber's Legislative Action Committee--monitoring and lobbying to pass legislation that will have a positive impact on Corona businesses. John and Carolyn also support numerous philanthropic causes and give generously to support community programs funded by non-profit agencies.  John's tireless passion for the high quality of his business and community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Corona, California. I am proud to call John a fellow community member, American and friend. I salute him and thank him for his service as he receives the prestigious YMCA Distinguished Service Award.                          ____________________
