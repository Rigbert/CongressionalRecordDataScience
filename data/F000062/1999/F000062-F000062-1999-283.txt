 President, today I am introducing legislation to end the practice of social promotion in our public schools and to provide remedial education to help students meet academic achievement standards. The Student Achievement Act of 1999 authorizes $500 million for five years for local school districts to provide extended learning time so that K-12 students can achieve.  Social promotion is the formal or informal practice of promoting a student from grade to grade even when the student fails to achieve a level of achievement and proficiency in the core curriculum.  To receive funds, schools would have to:  Adopt a policy prohibiting social promotion;  Require that students be subject to academic achievement standards in the core curriculum, defined as subjects such as reading, writing, language arts, mathematics, social sciences and science;  Test student achievement in meeting standards at certain benchmarks, to be determined by the states;  Provide remedial education; and  Have substantial numbers of low-performing students.  I am introducing this bill because I believe that the linchpin to educational reform is the elimination of the path of least resistance whereby students who are failing are simply promoted to the next grade in hopes that they will learn. The product of this practice of simply promoting youngsters when they are failing to adequately learn has produced a generation of young people who are below standard and high school graduates that cannot read or write, count change in their pockets or fill out an employment application. It is that bad.  And my state is just about the worst. There's a steady stream of bad news. On March 5, we learned, yet again that California ranks second to last among 39 states in fourth-grade reading skills. Eighty percent of my state's fourth graders are not proficient readers. For eighth graders, California is 33rd out of 36 states and only 22 percent of California's eighth graders are proficient readers.  On March 24, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that the state received a grade of D+ from the American Electronics Association for the quality and availability of an educated workforce. This conclusion is in the state that is the home of Silicon Valley, the premier high-tech area of the country, in a state that received an A for electronic commerce and is number one in high tech employment. But California does not have a school system that trains students well enough to work in the high-paying, skilled jobs available.  These numbers are a stunning indictment of a failing system.  It is time to end social promotion, a practice which misleads our students, their parents and the public. As long as social promotion exists and is widespread, youth who cannot read or write and who won't be able to find jobs in the future will continue to graduate from high school.  I agree with the conclusion of the September 1997 study conducted by the American Federation of Teachers:       ``Social promotion is an insidious practice that hides      school failure and creates problems for everybody--for kids,      who are deluded into thinking they have learned the skills to      be successful or get the message that achievement doesn't      count; for teachers who must face students who know that      teachers wield no credible authority to demand hard work; for      the business community and colleges that must spend millions      of dollars on remediation, and for society that must deal      with a growing proportion of uneducated citizens, unprepared      to contribute productively to the economic and civic life of      the nation.''  There is no hard data on the extent of social promotion in our public schools, but most authorities, in the schools and out, know that it is happening--and in fact, in some districts it is standard operating procedure.  The September AFT study surveyed 85 of the nation's 820 largest school districts in 32 states, representing one-third of the nation's public school enrollment, about their promotion policies.  Saying that social promotion is ``rampant,'' AFT leaders found that school districts' criteria for passing and retaining students is vague. Only 17 states have standards in the four core disciplines (English, math, social studies and science) that are well grounded in content and that are clear enough to be used.  A January 14, 1998 Los Angeles Times article reported that four in 10 teachers said that their schools automatically promote students when they reach the maximum age for their grade level.  None of the districts surveyed by AFT have an explicit policy of social promotion, but almost every district has an implicit practice of social promotion. Almost all districts view holding students back as a policy of last resort and many put explicit limits on retaining students. Districts have loose and vague criteria for moving a student from one grade to the next. This approach, concludes AFT, is implicit approval of social promotion.  Last fall, thankfully, former California Governor Pete Wilson signed into law a bill to end social promotion. In July 1998, I wrote some of California's school districts and asked about their policy on social promotion. Here are some of the reports I got back:  Some school districts did not have specific policies in place regarding social promotion. Exceptions to normal progression from one grade to another may be made when it is ``in the best interest of the student.'' Teachers may provide recommendations but final decisions on retention are made by the parent of the student.  In other cases, school districts required students to earn 220 credits to receive a high school diploma so that the district feels that ``social promotion is not an issue.''  One school district believes that ``it is seldom desirable for a student to be retained by reason of achievement, maturity or attendance because research has shown that retention is likely tohave strong negative effects.'' Retention is therefore discouraged in the primary grades and prohibited thereafter.  Here's another example: Dr. Rudy Crew, Chancellor of the New York City Schools, said in the January 25 New York Times that virtually every student is promoted from one grade to the next, regardless of performance on standardized tests.  Mike Wright, a San Diegian, is an example. Cited in the February 16 San Diego Union-Tribune, Mr. Wright says he routinely got promoted from grade to grade and even graduated from high school, even though he failed some subjects. At age 29, he is now enrolled in a community college program to learn to read--at age 29!  Here are some examples of the harm of social promotion:  In California, a December 1997 report from a state education accountability task force estimated that at least half of the state's students--3 million children--perform below levels considered proficient for their grade level.  A January 1998 poll by Public Agenda asked employers and college professors whether they believe a high school diploma guarantees that a student has mastered basic skills. In this poll, 63% of employers and 76 percent of professors said that the diploma is not a guarantee that a graduate can read, write or do basic math.  Nationwide, about one third of college freshmen take remedial courses in college and three-quarters of all campuses, public and private, offer remediation, says the AFT study.  A March 27 California State University study found that more than two-thirds of students entering Cal State campuses in Los Angeles lack the math or English they should have mastered in high school. At some high schools, not one graduate going on to one of Cal State's campuses passed a basic skills test. At Cal State Dominguez Hills, for example, 8 out of 10 freshmen enrollees last fall needed remedial English and 87 percent needed remedial math.  Sadly, these numbers represent an increase. In the fall of 1997, 47 percent of freshmen enrolled at CSU needed remediation, compared to 43 percent in each of the previous three years. In math, 54 percent needed remedial help, compared to 48 percent in 1994.  Similarly, almost 35 percent of entering freshmen at the University of California do poorly on UC's English proficiency test and must receive help in their first year.  Florida spent $53 million in college on remedial education, says the AFT study.  In Boston, school principals estimate that half their ninth graders are not prepared for high school work.  In Ohio, nearly one fourth of all freshmen who attend state public universities must take remedial math or English (Cleveland Plain Dealer, July 7, 1997)  Employers tell me that their new hires are unprepared for work and they have to provide very basic training to make them employable. For example, last year, MCI spent $7.5 million to provide basic skills training.  Fortunately, many policymakers are beginning to realize that we must stop social promotion. President Clinton called for ending it in his last two State of the Union speeches. Last year, he said, ``We must also demand greater accountability. When we promote a child from grade to grade who hasn't mastered the work, we don't do that child any favors. It is time to end social promotion in America's schools.''  Last year, California's former Governor Pete Wilson, signed into law a bill to end social promotion in our public education system. The bill requires school districts to identify students who are failing based on their grades or scores on the new statewide performance tests. The schools would have to hold back the student unless their teachers submitted a written finding that the student should be allowed to advance to the next grade. In such a case, the teacher would be required to recommend remediation to get the student to the next level, which could include summer school or after-school instruction.  Los Angeles Unified School District is currently working to develop a plan to end the practice of social promotion. Los Angeles Unified School Board plans to identify those students who are at risk of flunking and require them to participate in remedial classes. The alternative curriculum will stress the basics in reading, language arts and math, and special after-school tutoring. The district's plan would take effect in the 1999-2000 school year and target students moving in the third through sixth grades and into the ninth grade.  In San Diego, the School Board adopted requirements that all students in certain grades must demonstrate grade-level performance. And they will require all students to earn a C overall grade average and a C grade in core subjects for high school graduation, effectively ending social promotion for certain grades and for high school graduation. For example, San Diego's schools are requiring that eighth graders who do not pass core courses be retained or pass core courses in summer school.  At least three other states--Florida, Arkansas and Texas--explicitly outlaw social promotion.  The Chicago Public Schools have ditched social promotion. After their new policy was put in place in the spring of 1997, over 40,000 students failed tests in the third, sixth, eight and ninth grades and then went to mandatory summer school. Chicago School Superintendent calls social promotion ``educational malpractice.'' He says from now on his schools' only product will be student achievement.  Cincinnati's students are now promoted based on specific standards that define what students must know.  The AFT study says: ``In most districts, there are no agreed-upon explicit standards of performance to which students are held accountable.''  Our schools need clear, specific achievement levels for the core academic disciplines for every student. Many states are developing those achievement levels or standards. California's Commission for the Establishment of Academic Content and Performance Standards is developing statewide, grade-by-grade academic standards.  Without them, we will never know (1) what our students need to learn and (2) whether they have learned what they should learn. How, I ask, can you measure what you have accomplished if you don't know where you are going?  Sixty-one percent of Californians agreed in 1998 that our schools need a ``major overhaul,'' up from 54 percent who answered the same question two years earlier. A mere six percent believe that schools provide a ``quality education.''  A poll by Policy Analysis for California Education found that only 17 percent of the public considers the state's schools ``good'' or ``excellent,'' down from about 33 percent three years ago.  I hope my colleagues will join me today in stopping social promotion and providing remedial education because we must stop shortchanging our students.  School achievement must mean something. It must mean more than filling up a seat at a desk for 12 years. A diploma should not just be a symbol of accumulating time in school.  Social promotion is a cruel joke. We are fooling students. We are fooling ourselves. Students think a high school diploma means something. But in reality, a diploma does not mean much when we are graduating students who cannot count change, who cannot read a newspaper, or who cannot fill out an employment application. I hope this bill can help.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a summary be printed in the Record.
