Speaker, it is with sincere admiration that I recognize the Asian American Medical Association, which hosted its 36th Annual Gala on Saturday, November 3, 2012, at the Avalon Manor in Merrillville, Indiana. Each year, the Asian American MedicalAssociation pays tribute to prominent, outstanding citizens and organizations for their contributions to the community. In recognition of their efforts, these honorees are awarded the prestigious Crystal Globe Award at this annual banquet.  The Asian American Medical Association has always been a great asset to Northwest Indiana. Its members have selflessly dedicated themselves to providing quality medical services to the residents of Northwest Indiana and have always demonstrated exemplary service through their many cultural, scholastic, and charitable endeavors.  At this year's Annual Gala, the Asian American Medical Association will present the Crystal Globe Award to one of Northwest Indiana's finest citizens, Dr. Ilwoong Chang, M.D. For his outstanding contributions to his community, he is to be commended.  In 1966, Dr. Chang graduated from medical school at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. He then completed his internship at Yonsei University, during which time he participated in medical missions in rural areas of South Korea. Dr. Chang was a Naval Medical Officer from 1967 to 1970, during which time he served in Vietnam. He completed his residency at Wayne State University Hospital in Detroit, Michigan, in 1974, and in 1976, he went on to complete his Gastroenterology fellowship at the University of Illinois in Chicago. Doctor has dedicated much of his life to medical education and currently serves as Clinical Associate Professor in Internal Medicine and Gastroenterology at the Indiana University Northwest Center for Medical Education in Gary, Indiana. Dr. Chang also operates his private practice in Munster, Indiana, specializing in Gastroenterology.  Dr. Chang's remarkable resume includes many prestigious positions in the field of medicine. He has served as Chairman of Medicine at Community Hospital in Munster and President of Medical Staff, as well as Chairman of Quality Coordination Control at Saint Catherine Hospital in East Chicago. Doctor is also a member of many medical societies, including: the American Medical Association, the American Gastroenterology Association, and the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. In addition, he is a delegate of the Indiana State Medical Association, a member of the Insurance Committee of the Indiana State Medical Association, and Chairman of the Board of the Lake County Medical Society of Indiana. For his exceptional dedication to organizations that have a tremendous positive impact within the medical community and to the people of Northwest Indiana, Dr. Chang is worthy of the highest praise.  Dr. Chang's dedication to medicine and the community of Northwest Indiana is exceeded only by his devotion to his wonderful family. He has been married to his loving wife, Young Zin Chang, for 42 years. They have three amazing children: Gene, Elizabeth and David, and six beloved grandchildren.  Doctor is committed to his family, to improving the lives of the patients he serves, and working selflessly to enhance the quality of life of all those who live in Northwest Indiana. It is an honor to call him a friend.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending the members of the Asian American Medical Association, as well as this year's Crystal Globe Award recipient, Dr. Ilwoong Chang, for their outstanding contributions to the medical field, as well as to their communities and beyond. Their unwavering commitment to improving the quality of life for the people of Northwest Indiana and throughout the United States is truly inspirational, and I am proud to serve as their representative in Washington, DC.                          ____________________
