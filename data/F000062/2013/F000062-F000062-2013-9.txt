 President, I rise to support the Levin-McCain amendment, and I have added my name as a cosponsor. I would also like to speak in support of provisions authored by Chairman Levin that are in this year's National Defense Authorization Act, which provides more flexibility that the President and Secretary of Defense need in order to move detainees from Guantanamo.  I strongly support the Levin-McCain-Feinstein amendment. Here is what it would do: It would clarify that Guantanamo detainees transferred to the United States for law of war detention do not have any additional rights or benefits such as the right to claim asylum. So it limits it.  It would clarify that Gitmo detainees transferred to the United States may not be released from law of war detention into the United States.  Finally, it would require a detailed plan to be submitted to Congress on how to close Guantanamo, including the specific facilities intended to be used to hold detainees inside the United States.  I have heard Senator McCain talk about this, request it, and I believe it is a very valid need.  It has been 12 years since the attacks of 9/11 and the United States invasion of Afghanistan. In the ensuing years 779 people were brought to Guantanamo without charge, and for many of them, simply for being at the wrong place at the wrong time. Most of the 164 left have been held for more than 10 years. Those transferred to Guantanamo from CIA custody in black sites have been there now for 7 years. Unfortunately, we still have not figured out a way to close Guantanamo.  President George W. Bush called for it to be closed. So did former Secretaries of State Condoleezza Rice and Collin Powell, as well as former Secretaries of Defense Bob Gates and Leon Panetta, among others.  In fact, here is what President Bush wrote on pages 179 and 180 of his memoir Decision Points:       . . . there are things I wish had come out differently. I      am frustrated that the military tribunals moved so slowly.      Even after the Military Commissions Act was passed, another      lawsuit delayed the process again. By the time I left office,      we held only two trials. The difficulty of conducting trials      made it harder to meet a goal I had set in my second term:      closing the prison at Guantanamo in a responsible way. While      I believe opening Guantanamo after 9/11 was necessary, the      detention facility had become a propaganda tool for our      enemies and a distraction for our allies.  While I would like to go much further and close the facility immediately, the provisions in this bill will ease the transfer restrictions so that detainees can be held in other countries or tried, convicted, and put in a proper maximum security facility in the United States.  There are three categories of detainees left at Guantanamo:  First, 46 detainees will continue to be held on preventive detention, meaning they are being held under international law until the end of hostilities--whenever that may be. It could be years; it could be decades.  Second, 34 detainees have been slated for prosecution, and of those three detainees have already been convicted in a military commission and are still serving their time at Guantanamo. But most of these 34 detainees have not even been charged, and there is no indication when they will be.  The final category is the largest--84 of the 164 detainees currently at Guantanamo were cleared for transfer by a 2010--that's 3 years ago--interagency process carried out by our national security and intelligence agencies. But current law needlessly complicates efforts to transfer those 84 men.  President Bush transferred over 530 detainees from Guantanamo during his time in office and, unfortunately, many went on to commit terrorist acts because there were no individual assessments done on each detainee. But these individual assessments have been carried out by the Obama administration.  Despite his commitment to close Guantanamo, President Obama has been able to transfer only 67 detainees during his first term, and only two recommended for transfer have been successfully sent home under the burdensome procedures now in place. More are on the way, but this is an unacceptable delay because the government cleared these detainees for transfer years ago.  Sections 1031, 1032, and 1033 of this bill will give the President more flexibility to transfer these detainees out of Guantanamo. It is long overdue. I thank the chairman, who is sitting in front of me, and the ranking member for these provisions. But even under these provisions, the Secretary of Defense would still have to certify that the transfer is in our Nation's security interests and that appropriate steps have been taken to address the risk of recidivism. Congress would have to continue to be notified of such transfers.  In March of this year, Lt. Gen. John F. Kelly, the head of the U.S. Southern Command which has military responsibility for Guantanamo, testified to Congress about the massive hunger strikes that were going on at the time and said the detainees were devastated at the lack of transfers and the government's failure to execute plans to close it as the President has promised.  In June of this year, I traveled to Guantanamo with Senator McCain and the President's Chief of Staff to see this devastation for myself. On our trip, we saw the process that is used to retain the detainees as they are forced from their cells and brought in to be force fed. We did not see a detainee being force fed, but we saw the tube that is forced up their nose and down their throat into their stomach. It is coated with olive oil or Lanacane, if necessary, and it is done daily. We saw the restraints--at the legs, the arms, and the head where detainees are held--not too different from the image of a death row convict in an electric chair.  I said at the time and I will say it again today, the military and civilian personnel at work on Guantanamo are carrying out their duties with dedication, skill, and honor. My opposition to continued detention at Guantanamo is not an indictment against them; it is with a failed and bankrupt policy, including here in Congress, and now is the time to change it.  Another thing that struck me is the enormous costs we are sinking into this isolated facility each year. Detention operations at Guantanamo now total approximately $5 billion since the facility opened in January of 2002. According to the most recent estimates provided by the Department of Defense, the total cost for fiscal year 2013 is estimated to be $454.1 million, which equals approximately $2.8 million per detainee. That works out to be more than 35 times the cost to hold the prisoner in a supermax facility in Florence, CO. This supermax facility currently houses a number of Al Qaeda terrorists, including Zacarias Moussaoui, Shoe Bomber Richard Reid, and the would-be Christmas Day Bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab.  In this era of sequestration and furloughs, how can we justify spending approximately $2.8 million per Guantanamo detainee?  Now, even with near unanimous support across the current and past administration to close the structure, some appear to question whether there still is a national security need to shutter the facility. I believe it is clear that Guantanamo is still a symbol that motivates our enemies and draws more and more young Muslims to fight against the United States.  This is not just my determination but also the finding of our intelligence community. Last week, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper wrote to the Senate Intelligence Committee noting his support for the closure of Guantanamo in which he offered the following examples of how AlQaeda and its affiliates continue to reference Guantanamo in furtherance of their global jihadist goals.  Al Qaeda leader Ayman Zawahiri, in an audio statement in July of this year, cited the detention without trial of Gitmo prisoners as one indication of American hypocrisy and indiscriminate persecution of innocent Muslims. An article about the Boston Marathon bombings, in the most recent edition of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's ``Inspire'' magazine--this is kind of a diabolical magazine that Al Qaeda puts out and this is one published in June--highlighted the ongoing detention of prisoners at Gitmo as one of the purported justifications of terrorist attacks such as 9/11 and the Boston Marathon bombings.  Here is what the article said:       If we note down all that has been and is still being      carried out by America against Muslim nations, we will run      out of pages. . . . There is also the secret prisons and      black sites file, we could not miss out Guantanamo Bay      detention camp. The American Nation should have a good grasp      of all of these and other historic facts so that they can      comprehend the background and the context of the Boston      Marathon operation, Detroit, September 11 and other      operations which are barely a wave of anger; vengeance.  Furthermore, Guantanamo is referenced 20 times in the previous 10 issues of ``Inspire'' magazine.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from the DNI dated November 12, 2013.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                             Director of National Intelligence                                                   Washington, DC.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Saxby Chambliss,     Vice Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Madam Chairman and Vice Chairman Chambliss: As the      Senate considers provisions of the FY14 National Defense      Authorization bill that would lift Guantanamo detainee      transfer restrictions. I would like to provide the      Intelligence Community's views of the national security      implications in maintaining the Guantanamo Bay detention      facility (GTMO).       Al-Qa'ida, its affiliates, and its allies this year      continued to reference the detention and purported      mistreatment of the detainees at GTMO in furtherance of their      global jihadist narratives. The references to GTMO by al-     Qa'ida and affiliated organizations include:       Al-Qa'ida leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in an audio statement in      July 2013 citing the detention without trial of GTMO      prisoners as one indication of American hypocrisy and      indiscriminate persecution of innocent Muslims and calling      for all al-Qa'ida prisoners at GTMO to be released.       An article about the Boston marathon bombings in the most      recent edition of AQAP's Inspire magazine in June      highlighting the ongoing detention of prisoners at GTMO as      one of the purported justifications to engage in jihad.       As these examples illustrate, closing the Guantanamo Bay      detention facility would deprive al-Qa'ida leaders of the      ability to use alleged ongoing mistreatment of detainees to      further their global jihadist narrative. In an effort to      disrupt the narrative used by terrorists, I support the      President's priority of closing the detention facility.           Sincerely,                                                 James R. Clapper.
