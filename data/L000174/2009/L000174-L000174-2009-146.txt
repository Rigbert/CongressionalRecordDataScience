Two hundred twenty-two years ago today, the Constitutional Convention finished its work and proposed our fundamental charter.  With this vote, the Senate will finally begin fulfilling one of its most important constitutional duties by granting consent to the President's lifetime appointment to the Federal judiciary. This is the first Federal circuit court judge the Senate has confirmed all year. The Senate has yet to confirm a single district court judge. Judicial vacancies have spiked and could approach 120 soon.  We all know Judge Lynch is an outstanding judge and will make an excellent circuit judge. His nomination has been on the calendar awaiting Senate action for more than 3 months. I am glad his wait is finally over. The President made a good nomination, and the Senate should grant consent so that Judge Lynch's appointment may finally proceed.
