Mr. Speaker, today we have been given another chance to do what is right for our unemployed brothers and sisters. We must extend unemployment insurance. It is the right thing to do. It is the moral thing to do. It is the compassionate thing to do.  Those of you who have said that the unemployed are lazy or want a hand-out should be ashamed of yourselves. This is not a hand-out. People have paid into the system their whole working lives. The unemployed in this country want to work, they are desperate to work, and we must help them get by.  I challenge each of you who plan to vote ``no'' to come to Georgia. Go into your own districts. I challenge you to look people in the eye and tell them that you voted ``no.'' I challenge you to tell the people that you value ideology more than empathy and compassion for your fellow man.                              {time}  1340  Tell them as they swallow their pride that you don't care, that you don't have a heart, that you don't have any feeling. Explain to them why you voted ``yes'' for war funding and ``yes'' for tax breaks for the rich but ``no'' for hardworking Americans who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own. It is wrong, just plain wrong.  The time is always right to do what is right. Do not be afraid to be compassionate. Do not be afraid to vote with your heart and your conscience. Vote to extend unemployment, and extend it now. Do it for the people.                Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore
