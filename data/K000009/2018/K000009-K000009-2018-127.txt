Speaker, I urge my colleagues to once again oppose this partisan talking point and demand action on an agreement to fund the entire government for the remaining part of this fiscal year. We have little more than a week to secure a plan for the remainder of 2018, but it may be a road too far if Republicans don't come to the table to talk among themselves seriously and then be willing to negotiate with this side of the aisle.
