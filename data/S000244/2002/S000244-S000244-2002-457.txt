Speaker, I have introduced a resolution expelling the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Traficant) from the House of Representatives. Last week, a Federal court jury in Cleveland found the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Traficant) guilty on all 10 felony counts of a criminal indictment. Regretfully, this resolution is necessary because Mr. Traficant foolishly rejected the call of the minority leader to resign. Felons belong in jail and not in Congress. He has broken the public trust by breaking the law; and if he will not voluntarily leave this House, our duty is to remove him.  Throughout my tenure in the House, I have consistently taken the position that Members who have been convicted of felonies should be expelled if they do not resign. In 1980, the House expelled Michael Meyers of Pennsylvania after he refused to resign following conviction of Abscam-related felonies. In 1995, Walter Tucker of California was convicted, initially refused to resign, and changed his mind after I introduced an expulsion resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I hope that Mr. Traficant will follow the example of Mr. Tucker and save the House the need to debate once again whether felons should continue to serve in Congress.                          ____________________
