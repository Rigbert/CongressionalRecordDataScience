 President, Bob Barker has graced millions of living rooms with his warm presence and genuine manner. Sadly today airs his final episode hosting America's beloved ``The Price is Right'' on CBS, but today is appropriate to remember the impact this wonderful man had on all of us, as he became a piece of our history and a small part of our lives each day.  Bob Barker's name is synonymous with CBS's ``The Price is Right,'' which he began hosting on September 4, 1972. It ends today as the longest running daytime game show in television history. He holds a plethora of longevity records, including a record for holding a weekday TV job continuously for 50 years as of 2006, the oldest person to receive an MTV movie award for his role in the comedy ``Billy Madison,'' and he has hosted or appeared on a 5-day-a-week television program longer than anyone else in the history of television. Also on December 31, 2006, Bob Barker celebrated the anniversary of his 50th year on national television. He is truly a fixture in American culture and television legend. His grace and humor have truly contributed to his success, and will be missed greatly by his millions of loyal fans ranging from the young to the young at heart.  Bob Barker is also a strong advocate for animal rights, and brings that passion into his role as host of ``The Price is Right.'' He credits his love of animals and awareness to animal rights activism to his late wife Dorothy Jo. He continued the work in her memory. Bob insisted the show stop giving away fur coats as prizes, and formed the DJ Foundation that contributes millions of dollars to fund animal rescue and park facilities across the country. His passion for the cause has even brought him here to Washington, DC, where he spoke on Capitol Hill on the issue of animal rights.  Barker has been recognized for his success and talent by receiving 17 Emmy Awards and the Lifetime Achievement Award for Daytime Television in 1999. Barker has also had thehonor of being inducted into the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Hall of Fame. In March of 1998, to commemorate the five thousandth episode of ``The Price is Right,'' CBS dedicated the show's soundstage in his honor.  America will certainly miss being greeted by the smiling and vibrant face of Bob Barker each morning, however, his success in both his career and in life are indisputable. There is no doubt Bob Barker has positively impacted the lives of many, and on this day as we celebrate with Bob the airing of his final episode hosting ``The Price is Right,'' we should also extend our thanks to Bob for the many delightful years and countless memories he has granted us.                          ____________________
