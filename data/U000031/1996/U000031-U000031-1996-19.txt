Speaker: I would like to express my support for S. 652, the Telecommunications Act conference report, as I believe it is an important step forward in the development of our telecommunications policy. The issues we are discussing today--involving local and long distance phones service, cable TV, cellular phones, and more--will truly touch the lives of all Americans. As a member of the Commerce Committee which drafted and approved this bill last year, I'm pleased that we are finally on the verge of seeing this legislation enacted.  The national telecommunications network will play a very central role as we prepare to enter the 21st century. Throughout Michigan and the entire Nation, we must prepare ourselves to take advantage of the latest technology and do our best to see that there are no potholes on the information superhighway.  There are many important issues in the bill before us today. Let me just take a moment to take note of an issue of particular concern to the people of southwest Michigan--local marketing agreements, also known as LMA's.  A very successful LMA is in existence between two stations in western Michigan, WOOD-TV in Grand Rapids and WOTV in Battle Creek. In 1991, WOTV has suffered millions of dollars of losses and was forced to terminate their news operation and layoff many employees while they searched for a buyer.  In late 1991, WOTV was able to enter into an LMA and bring the station back to financial stability. They now have a fully staffed news department dedicated to bringing local news to their viewers. Additionally, they are very active in community affairs such as events at Western Michigan University and the Kalamazoo Air Show.  I am fully in support of efforts to allow for the continuation of LMA's in the future and I'm pleased that these provisions are part of S. 652.  I believe that under this bill, we are preparing our nation for the wave of the future and leading the world into the 21st century.
