Speaker, it is my great pleasure to commend Pastor James Alexander Anderson on the momentous occasion of his retirement and 39th anniversary as a pastor. A week-long retirement and anniversary celebration for Pastor Anderson, given by the Washington Street Church of God parishioners, will take place form October 26, 1997 to November 2, 1997. The celebration will include a program of revival ministers throughout the week, who will offer remarks on Pastor Anderson's distinguished career. The festivities will conclude with a banquet at Marquette Park Pavilion in Gary, IN, on Sunday, November 2, 1997.  Pastor Anderson received his calling in 1947, upon returning to Gary, IN, from his service with the U.S. Army. During a revival meeting, without hesitation, he accepted his summons with a resolute commitment to fulfill and carry out his mission to preach. Although Pastor Anderson had initially planned to attend college and pursue a medical career, he fully embraced his new challenges as a spiritual healer and guide. His first pastorship was in Muncie, IN, where he remained for over a year. In 1957, Pastor Anderson was selected as pastor of the Washington Street Church of God, where he has faithfully served in this capacity since then. Throughout his career, Pastor Anderson has demonstrated his commitment to being an effective and instrumental leader through his diligent pursuit of a greater understanding of scripture and the ministry. Over the years, Pastor Anderson attended such institutions as Anderson College and Anderson College Seminary in Anderson, IN, and the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, IL.  Over the years, Pastor Anderson has made numerous contributions to his congregation, as well as to the surrounding community. Perhaps his most noteworthy accomplishment was his founding of a homeless shelter in 1984. Pastor Anderson led the Washington Street Church of God congregation in undertaking the challenging task of renovating a church-owned building into the Brother's Keeper Homeless Shelter. Had it not been for Pastor Anderson's leadership and ambition, many individuals in the city of Gary would be left without lodging over an extended period of time. Pastor Anderson has also devoted much of his time to assisting various church-affiliated organizations. For 13 years, he served as a member of the missionary board of the Church of God in Anderson, IN. He was also a member of the Interfaith Clergy Council of Gary and vicinity, and the credentials and ordination committee in Indianapolis, IN. Pastor Anderson is also the former dean of the Sunday School Superintendents and Teachers Council of Gary, and for 10 years, he was treasurer of the General Ministerial Assembly of the National Association of the Church of God in West Middlesex, PA.  Pastor Anderson's retirement and anniversary is of special importance to the Washington Street Church of God family, as the occasion serves as a unique opportunity to celebrate the valiant leadership, commitment, and selflessness that have characterized his service to the congregation and to the community at-large. During this special time, the congregation will remember Pastor Anderson's steadfast will and determination to complete his mission, which motivated him to successfully recover from a severe stroke in 1988. Above all, Pastor Anderson will be remembered for doing many good things for a wide variety of people, without seeking credit for his accomplishments.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating James Alexander Anderson on the eventof his retirement and 39th anniversary as a pastor. His wife, Hardina Anderson, can be proud of her husband's ministry, as his dedication to his church and to his community serves as an inspiration to us all.                          ____________________
