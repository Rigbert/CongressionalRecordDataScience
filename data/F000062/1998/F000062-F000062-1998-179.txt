 President, at this time, on behalf of Senator Brownback, Senator Glenn, and myself, I send to the desk for reference to committee a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which, in essence, deals with the explosion of three nuclear devices by the Government of India yesterday. As this body well knows, the Government of India conducted underground tests on three separate nuclear explosive devices, including a fission device, a low-yield device, and a thermonuclear device. They did this also very close to the border of Pakistan, thereby raising tensions between the two countries and in the entire south Asia region.  This sense of the Senate will condemn that explosion in the strongest possible terms and will call upon the President of the United States to carry out the provisions of the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994 with respect to India and invoke all sanctions therein.  It will also call upon the Government of India to take immediate steps to reduce tensions that this unilateral and unnecessary step has caused.  I am aware that Senator Brownback's subcommittee, of which I am a member, will be meeting tomorrow, and will be discussing this issue, and, hopefully, will be able to agree to this resolution.  I am delighted to work with the Senator, and I note that he is present on the floor at this time, so I will say no more but simply send this to the desk.
