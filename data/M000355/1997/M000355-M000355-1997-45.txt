 President, I am not the majority leader, but I wanted to make a couple observations about the comments of the Democratic leader. First of all, paycheck protection is not a poison pill; it is an important piece of legislation. It was in the top 10 pieces of legislation, I say to my friend from South Dakota, that we introduced at the beginning of this year on this side of the aisle. It has probably as many supporters as McCain-Feingold does. So it is curious to me that paycheck protection, when linked up with McCain-Feingold, is a poison pill but the converse apparently isn't true.  So, again, I am not the majority leader, but I will say it is my intent to bring up paycheck protection any time any effort was made to try to force through McCain-Feingold.  But what the majority leader has done here is offer an opportunity with a very good debate. I disagree with my friend from South Dakota; I think it is a good debate. I wish he had had a chance to listen to more of it. He might have changed his position. We are going to have a good debate this afternoon. A number of Senators want to speak.  Let me be very clear, at least as far as this one Senator is concerned, there is no campaign finance reform without paycheck protection. They are the Siamese twins, Mr. President, the Siamese twins of this discussion. So paycheck protection will, indeed, be back as well.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
