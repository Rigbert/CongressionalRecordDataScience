So two patients. And that's what led Dr. Nathanson. When he was doing blood transfusions at St. Luke's Hospital and prenatal surgery, and he would say this patient here who deserves respect is getting help he or she needs while in another room of that hospital or clinic, they're getting dismembered or chemically poisoned or killed by some other toxic substance, and they call that abortion and ``free choice.'' It is violence against children and it is injurious to mothers as well.  I just met, Dr. Broun, with some individuals, a father whose daughter committed suicide in New Jersey some time ago as a direct result of an abortion. She was one of the happiest young women imaginable. Her brother and father came to visit me. She went into a very severe mental, and you probably could speak to that very well, downward slope after she had that abortion. The mental complications are very real. I know we're here to talk about embryonic stem cell research, but it is so closely allied to the dehumanization of unborn life and newly created human life. And as I said at the outset, birth is an event that happens to all of us. It is not the beginning of life. The Flat Earth Society folks might say that's when life begins, but 3D ultrasound, 4D ultrasound, has shattered that myth.  I yield to Dr. Broun.
