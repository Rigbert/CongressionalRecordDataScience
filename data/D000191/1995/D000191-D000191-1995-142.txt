Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I guess the bottom line here is that we often get embroiled in these formula debates here in the House. And I have heard some seemingly convincing arguments on the other side enumerating the number of States that would benefit under one formula or the other. But, of course, part of what is neglected in that argument is the population base on those States.  Actually, under the Lipinski amendment, the math is pretty simple for 299 Members of this House and for the constituents of 299 Members of this House. There is not enough money to do everything we need to do in wastewater treatment. I think there should be more money in the budget. I think the Republican budget proposed yesterday by slashing funds for infrastructure and wastewater treatment is going the wrong way. I would be willing to support a higher emphasis on these needs in our Nation. But given the fact we are fighting over a shrinking pie here, there is a pretty basic equation.  That is, if you lose under the committee bill, which 299 Members of this body do, far more than a simple majority, those same 299 Members still lose under the Bateman substitute to the Lipinski amendment.  So I would suggest, despite all the Rube Goldberging and everything else that is going on around here, that we get back to the basic facts. And that is, the needs are not met in those States represented by 299 Members any better than they are in the other States represented by a minority of Members in this House who would benefit under this amendment. So I would strongly suggest that any of those 299 who vote to gut the Lipinski amendment will perhaps have some explaining to do when they go home to their constituents.
