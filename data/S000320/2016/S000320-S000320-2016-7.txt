 President, I rise today to honor the life of my friend Garry Neil Drummond of Birmingham, AL, who passed away on July 13, 2016. He will be long remembered as an iconic leader and skilled entrepreneur who left a positive impact on the coal and mining industry and the State of Alabama.  Garry was born in Walker County, AL. He earned a bachelor of science in civil engineering from the University of Alabama in 1961. After graduation, he joined Drummond Company, Inc., and became the first engineer hired by the company.  Garry's father, H.E. Drummond, began the Drummond Coal Company in Sipsey, AL, in 1935 to serve as a coal provider for farms and households. At age 15, Garry began working in coal mines across Walker County with his father. He was eventually named chief executive officer of the Drummond Company, and he served in this role for more than 50 years.  Garry was a founder of the American Coal Foundation, and in 1978, he served as the first chairman of the Mining and Reclamation Council of America, which later merged with the National Coal Association. Garry also served on the boards of the National Mining Association and the Alabama Coal Association.  He was a longtime member of the University of Alabama board of trustees and served as president pro tem of the board. He was also the university's ``Outstanding Alumnus'' for 1987-88. Garry was inducted into the AlabamaAcademy of Honor in 1989, the Alabama Engineering Hall of Fame in 1997, the Alabama Business Hall of Fame in 2003, and the Birmingham Business Hall of Fame in 2010.  A dedicated civil servant, Garry served on the boards of the Big Oak Ranch, Inc., Boy Scouts of America Greater Alabama Council, the Business Council of Alabama, the Economic Development Partnership of Alabama, the Rotary Club of Birmingham, and Glenwood, Inc.  Largely due to Garry's steadfast leadership, Drummond Company today includes large coal mines in Alabama and Colombia, South America, a worldwide coal sales organization, ABC Coke--the largest merchant foundry coke producer in the United States--and a real estate division with major developments in Lakeland, FL, Palm Springs, CA, and Birmingham, AL.  Garry's many successes, accomplishments, and contributions to the State of Alabama and the coal and mining industries will not soon be forgotten. He was truly a remarkable businessman, an unwavering leader, a devoted civil servant, and a loyal friend.  I offer my deepest condolences to Garry's wife, Peggy Drummond, his four children, his large extended family, and countless friends as they celebrate his exceptional life and mourn this great loss.                          ____________________
