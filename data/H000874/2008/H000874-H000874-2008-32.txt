 Now, frankly, I don't want to get into moving rapidly. The administration, ofcourse, came here Thursday and wanted us to pass $700 billion, and they want us to pass this very soon. So ``rapidly'' sometimes is in the eye of the beholder.  The point is, you're correct; there was a discrepancy. We think that was not fair. It was not intentional. But Mr. Arcuri, who gave the information to the minority and the information that was on the Web site, was not correct. We think, under those circumstances, in fairness to all, that we ought to redo this, and that's what we intend to do. And we discussed it with your leadership and we all agreed that that was the right thing to do.
