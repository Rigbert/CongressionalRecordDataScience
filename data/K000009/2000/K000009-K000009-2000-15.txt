Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  I just wanted to end by pointing out an important clarification here. The gentlewoman from Missouri indicated there was a Supreme Court case or an appeals court case and inferred that it supported her point of view.  Let me say that the Supreme Court declined to review the SmithKline case so the appeals court stands. If the law requires you to use labels, you must. And that is exactly what the Democratic amendment required, exactly what the Waxman amendment required, exactly what the DeLauro amendment required in the subcommittee markup.
