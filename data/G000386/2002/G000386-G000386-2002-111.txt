 President, I do not support Senator Stabenow's amendment No. 4305 to S. 812 to amend section 1927 of the Social Security Act. As my colleague Senator Nickles pointed out during debate, this amendment raises important policy and budgetary questions that have not yet been considered by the Senate during a hearing or a committee mark-up. The far-reaching nature of this amendment deserves serious consideration by Congress prior to a vote. Additionally, at present there are pending legal decisions related to matters addressed in this amendment, and I believe it is worthwhile to await the decision of the courts prior to enactment of this amendment. For these reasons, I do not support this amendment, but I reserve the right to re-evaluate the matter at a later date.
