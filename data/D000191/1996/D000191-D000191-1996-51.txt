Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the time. The debate thus far has been interesting.  I would just like to reflect on what the House has been doing the last couple of days. We considered legislation regarding housing for tens of millions of Americans across the country and the assistance they might receive from the Federal Government. We spent over an hour and a half debating the issue of pets. Pets in public housing. But during the consideration of this bill there will not be 1 minute, there will not be 1 second spent on the issue of whether or not the United States of America should continue to acquire B-2 bombers, a weapon that is worth more than its weight in gold. Every single ounce of that plane is worth more than an ounce of gold.  Not 1 minute will be spent on whether or not we should acquire additional B-2 bombers, a weapon system that even the Pentagon does not want. But that could not happen here on the floor.  Now, the chairman will say, well, no one wanted to offer it. It was not offered because we all knew it was a done deal. The books were cooked and these kind of amendments were not going to be allowed. Why not have an open rule? The famous open rule, where we would consider any and all amendments offered by people legitimately elected.
