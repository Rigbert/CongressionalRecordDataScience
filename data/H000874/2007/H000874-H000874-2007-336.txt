 First of all, this bill is $700 million below what the Republican President asked us to spend. All of this stuff about how we're the big spenders, when this bill is $700 million less than President Bush asked us to spend. Number one.  I have been in this House for 26 years. Eighteen of those years we have had Republican Presidents. During those 18 years, we have run up $4.5 trillion of deficit spending. One person in America can stop spending: a President. During those 26 years, a veto of a President that was vetoed because we spent too much money has never been overridden. Not once. $4.5 trillion of deficit spending under Ronald Reagan, George Bush I, and 6 years of George Bush II.  Now, Bill Clinton was President for 8 years during those 26 years that I have served. And we ended up with a $62.5 billion surplus in those 8 years. And perhaps if you come to this floor and say it enough, the big lie said over and over and over and over again, just like Frank Luntz wrote it for you, maybe the American public will believe it. Isn't it a shame, however, that Frank Luntz can't fix the figures in your budget document.  You have been in control, of course, for the last 6 years of everything. And guess what happened? We doubled the rate of spending from the Clinton administration to the last 6 years. Doubled it. And we, I can't know what the geometric figure is in terms of escalating the debt and going from a $5.6 trillion surplus which George Bush, President of the United States, said Bill Clinton left him, and you turned that into a $3 trillion deficit in 72 months. I daresay nobody in the history of the world has done that. Nobody in the history of the world has been that fiscally irresponsible. And for the large part you did it without a single Democratic vote. And you didn't need us to vote, because you were in control of everything.  And I sit there and listen to this, and I won't characterize it as my chairman characterized it, although I can't say that I come here and disagree with my chairman, but I won't characterize it. But honesty at some point in time has a virtue. You ought to try it. Just for a little bit.                             Point of Order
