It is a bizarre tax policy. If you will remember correctly, we were told by the administration that went ahead with the tax break that the reason we could do that was because they projected surpluses of $5.2 trillion over the next 10 years. And with all this money, the obvious question they asked was: Why should the Government keep the people's money? Let's give it back to them. Some us who lived through the deficit years said we should be more careful in how we make these decisions. But they went ahead and passed the tax cut.  But a year later, they said: We made a mistake; it is not going to be a $5.2 trillion surplus over the next 10 years. It is going to be $1.2 trillion. What happens with the $4 trillion? Three things happened to it: The recession continued, an unexpected war took place; but for 40 percent of it, it was a direct result of that tax cut decision. That, to me, was the wrong thing to do. It is not cautious or prudent. We will pay for it if we are not careful.
