  Yet, according to an AP story this morning, that is looking like yet another empty promise.  According to the story, a furniture supply store owner in Springfield, IL, Zach Hoffman, was confident he qualified for the new small business tax credit. Yet buried in the new law's fine print was language disqualifying his 24 employees from this needed help.  According to the law, Mr. Hoffman created too many jobs to get help, and he paid them too much, even though his average employees only made $35,000 a year.  Mr. Hoffman called this a bait and switch and noted that in order to get the most out of the new credit, he would have to cut his workforce to 10 employees and slash their wages.  ``That seems like a strange outcome,'' he said, ``given we've got 10 percent unemployment.''  Speaker Pelosi told Americans we had to pass the health care bill so we could know what was in it. Now that Americans are learning what was buried in the fine print, they are rightly upset.
