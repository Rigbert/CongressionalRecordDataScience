President, as some of my colleagues know, I was considering introducing, as a substitute to the bill by the distinguished Senator from Georgia and others, the bill of the distinguished gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Porter, as introduced in the other body. I am withholding that because staff from my office and staff of the distinguished Senator from Georgia and others have been talking about some additional amendments to the pending legislation that, if acceptable to all sides, would improve a number of the concerns that the Senator from Vermont has with the pending legislation, concerns I will not go into again here because the Senator from Vermont has discussed them on a number of occasions on the floor.  While I was waiting to make that announcement, though, I could not but hear some comments of the Senator from Texas regarding the budget.  Frankly, I will say to my friend from Texas or anybody else, if they are not happy with the recommendations being made by the White House or Democratic Senators or anything else, the Republican Party has a majority of the Members in the House of Representatives, the Republican Party has a majority of the Members in the Senate of the United States. All they have to do, if they have a budget they prefer to anything the President has, is bring it forward and pass it. They have enough votes to pass it. And the President cannot even veto it; it is a budget resolution. So it is a little bit disingenuous to suggest that somehow the President or anybody else is winning on this.  The Republican Party has the majority of votes in the House and the Senate. A budget resolution cannot be vetoed. All they have to do is pass it. In fact, the law requires that they pass it by April 15--I mean, April 15 of this year, not next year. The law also requires that you and I, Mr. President, file our income taxes by April 15. If we do not, we get a knock on the door from the IRS. Apparently nobody is going to knock on the door when the Congress did not pass a budget resolution by April 15.  But I suggest, before anybody goes tearing too hard after the President or anybody else that may have been negotiating a budget, with all due respect to my friends on the other side of the aisle, if they do not like it, just pass their own. They could have followed the law and passed one by April 15. They did not. I will not chastise them for not obeying the law, even though they want the rest of us to. But just pass it, if you like. You can do it. I will also say, as far as passing an automatic continuing resolution, whoa Nellie, that has nothing to do with cutting budgets. I am perfectly happy to vote for budget cuts. I voted for more successful budget cuts than an awful lot of people in this body, I mean those that actually passed in the Appropriations Committee and elsewhere.  But this idea of some kind of an automatic continuing resolution is just a law that says we do not have to do our work. Now, by the end of September we have to pass 13 appropriations bills. If we all just go off and take another vacation, do not pass them, then this law proposed by the Senator from Texas and others would kick in, and nobody would even know if we were out of town.  I prefer we do our work. Maybe some of the same people, some of the same people who were unable to come up with a budget by April 15, who refused to follow the law to come up with a budget by April 15, want this new wrinkle, this unprecedented wrinkle of basically passing appropriations bills in advance, because if you pass this law, this continuing resolution, we can just go home. Maybe the American people would like that, but I do not think we are meeting our responsibilities. So I think we should stop the gimmicks in the appropriations bills. And this is just one more. It is not an issue of whether you want to cut budgets or not. It is an issue of whether we do our work.  We have had several vacations this year and we confirmed two Federal judges and we are now in the fifth month. There are 100 vacancies. We have had several vacations this year and we are now in May, even though the budget resolution is supposed to be here April 15. I think before we pass any more laws that allow us to escape the responsibility for carrying out our actions in this body, we ought to do what we are supposed to do.
