President, I might also add yesterday I submitted a resolution on the same subject and was happy to have Senator Collins as a cosponsor, along with several other colleagues who have joined us. They include Senators Mikulski, Tim Johnson, Menendez, Wicker, Moran, and Markey.  The goal--I will not go through all of the important statistics that have been related during this floor presentation by my colleagues--but our goal is to make sure the national plan which isbeing developed to address Alzheimer's is carried out. We want to reinforce the initial steps to a greater investment in finding answers, and I think everyone is on that same track.  We believe that supporting the goals and implementation of the National Alzheimer's Project Act and the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease is the right course to follow.  Achieving these goals means Federal funding must be there to implement it. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan resolution and reinforce our national commitment to turning around the seeming inevitability of this terrible disease.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure investments are made in Alzheimer's research.  Let me just say parenthetically, if you think we can sequester funds for the National Institutes of Health and honestly deal with the challenge of Alzheimer's, you are wrong. You cannot cut funding at the National Institutes of Health in the name of sequestration, cutting grants that could find breakthrough cures for many diseases. You cannot cut those funds and discourage researchers from even participating in future research and expect to solve the medical challenges that face us, including Alzheimer's.  I am urging my colleagues to look at this not as just a matter of resolutions, which are important, but also funding which is critical so we can find the solutions to these problems in a manner that is reasonable and quickly done.                          ____________________
