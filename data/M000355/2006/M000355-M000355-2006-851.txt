 President, this is an important coal mine safety bill which has been cleared on both sides of the aisle.  I commend Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi for their extraordinary effort in putting this measure together on a broad bipartisan basis. As I indicated, it has been cleared on both sides of the aisle. It is time to pass this measure and hope that the House will act in short order.
