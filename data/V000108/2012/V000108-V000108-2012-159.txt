Speaker, it is with great pleasure and honor that I congratulate Mrs. Edna Ecklund on a momentous milestone, her 100th birthday, which was on April 14, 2012. Edna celebrated with family and friends on Friday, April 13, 2012, at the Kindred Healthcare facility in Dyer, Indiana.  Mrs. Ecklund was born on April 14, 1912, in Crete, Illinois. She is the oldest of three children born to Henry and Clara Reichert. Her family later moved to Indiana and lived on a farm between Crown Point and Lowell. On June 5, 1931, Edna married Clarence Ecklund, and they lived in various locations throughout the region over the years. In 1962, Clarence and Edna moved to Schererville, Indiana, where Edna remained until relocating to her current residence. Edna worked most of her life as a millinery salesperson for the Edward C. Minas department store in downtown Hammond, Indiana, before moving to the store's River Oaks location in nearby Calumet City, Illinois. Edna, who retired in 1974, has always been known as an outstanding saleswoman with an exquisite fashion sense.  In addition to her successful career, Mrs. Ecklund was a member of the Order of the Eastern Star for many years. She is also a member of Immanuel United Church of Christ in Highland, Indiana. Edna has many friends and family who share a common respect for her commendable qualities, including her vigor, sense of humor, and kindness. Edna, an avid musician, has played both the organ and the piano for many years. A truly remarkable woman, Edna's dedication to her career and her involvement in her community is exceeded only by her devotion to her amazing family and friends.  Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring Edna Ecklund on this special day and in wishing her a very happy 100th birthday!                          ____________________
