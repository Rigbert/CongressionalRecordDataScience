 President, this rule is designed to protect Members who need more time to examine an issue, to discuss it with their colleagues, or to prepare amendments. A very relevant factor.  My own office was alerted to the presence of Mr. Roberts and of Mrs. Cook on their hearing agenda the day before the actual hearing. In other words, we learned at 4:46 p.m., Tuesday, January 28, that the next day they would be up for hearing along with Mr. Sutton. I ask unanimous consent that that e-mail be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   Tentative Nominations Witness List   tentative agenda--Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing on Judicial    Nominations, Wednesday, January 29, 2003 at 9:30 a.m., Dirksen 226                                Panel I       The Honorable Dianne Feinstein, United States Senator (D-     CA).
