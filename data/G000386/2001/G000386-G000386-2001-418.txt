  The fiscal discipline of the country's budget is important. I share that goal--fiscal discipline first. The budgetapproved by a bipartisan majority of the Congress meets the test of fiscal discipline.  The trigger is unwise because it undermines the long-term stimulative effect of the tax cut. It makes the tax cut uncertain.  The trigger is unnecessary because the pattern of the tax cut follows the pattern of the projected surplus.  The lion's share of the revenue loss occurs after 5 years.  Finally, if things go south on the projections, you can be sure Congress will raise taxes:  Over the last 20 years we have raised taxes in 1982, 1984, 1990, and 1993. Only twice has Congress pushed through a tax cut that became law--1981 and 1997.  Conditional tax cuts are not desirable--they do not stimulate workers, investors, and businesses behavior. Let us have certainty in tax relief. The American people, who are taxed at record post war levels, deserve no less.
