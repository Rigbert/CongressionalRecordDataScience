President, this morning we heard the Republican leader come to the floor again--this is not the first time--to address the health care situation in America. I have read his previous speech, and I listened to his speech today. It is clear to me he does not believe we are facing a crisis when it comes to health care. I think we are. I think it is a serious crisis. It is a crisis where 47 million Americans have no health insurance. Imagine, if you will, being a parent and having children with no health insurance coverage. Imagine yourself in a position where an accident or a diagnosis at a doctor's office could literally mean you would lose every penny you have ever saved in your life for expensive medical care when you do not have health insurance. Imagine that as a crisis that affects Americans, too many of them today.
