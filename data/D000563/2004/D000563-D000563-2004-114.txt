Open World is unique in its place within the legislative branch. When I supported the expansion to the Baltics, on the eve of new nations such as Lithuania joining NATO and the European Union, I hoped that the program would strengthen ties between countries such as Lithuania and Ukraine that enjoy enormous diaspora populations in America and remain the focus of efforts by U.S. citizens to build democratic institutions in these countries. Open World has brought three groups from Lithuania--mayors, representatives of the media, NGO leaders--each of whom has traveled to 10 States including Illinois. I know firsthand from the United States Ambassador to Lithuania, Steve Mull, invaluable it has been to have the opportunity to nominate young Lithuanian leaders for Open World and to see them return home with concrete ideas to develop Lithuania's local governmental structures, particularly in its rural areas. I thank Senator Stevens and Senator Campbell for their leadership in expanding Open World. I have been pleased to support it and commend it to my colleagues as an invaluable partner to those of us in the Congress interested in foreign policy issues across the board.
