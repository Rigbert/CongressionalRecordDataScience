Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to recognize Reverend Otis Sneed, Jr., Pastor of God's Church International Fellowship in Atlanta upon his recent consecration to the sacred office of Bishop according to the Apostolic Succession. I offer him my sincere congratulations and thanks for his continued commitment to transforming inner city communities.  Through his strong faith and Christian principles Bishop Sneed has bridged the racial, economic, social, educational and generational gaps in our community. He has served the metro Atlanta community with integrity and honesty. His service to my district has been invaluable and I wish him continued success in all his future endeavors. I ask that the Consecration documents be placed in the Congressional Record.      The International Fellowship of Reformed Episcopal Churches                        mandate of consecration       Be it known to all that the Holy Synod of the International      Fellowship of Reformed Episcopal Churches has approved the      consecration of The Reverend Odis Sneed, Jr. of God's Church      International Fellowship with jurisdiction over the State of      Georgia and its environs.

Wilbert Sterling McKinley,       Patriarch.     Trevor Dominic Bentley,       Exarch.                      Certificate of Consecration                       in the name of god, amen.       Be it known to all present that we by divine right      Patriarch of the International Fellowship of Reformed      Episcopal Churches did on this the fifteenth day of October      in the year of Our Lord two thousand and five ordain and      consecrate our well beloved in Christ,                      The Reverend Odis Sneed, Jr.                        to the office of Bishop       Of the one true Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church and      appoint him Bishop of Georgia with his see in Atlanta.       Of whose spiritual advancement, love of the Lord Jesus      Christ, educational qualifications and knowledge of Holy      Scriptures we are well acquainted,       Given under our seal and signature       In this our thirty-third year of Episcopacy     Most Reverend Wilbert S. McKinley,       Consecrator.     Most Reverend Trevor D. Bentley,       Co-consecrator.     Most Reverend Michael Rene Lunsford.                             Incardination                                  into      The International Fellowship of Reformed Episcopal Churches                                   of                 God's Church International Fellowship                      instrument of intercommunion         in the name of the most holy and indivisible trinity.                               article I       The International Fellowship of Reformed Episcopal      Churches, recognize with gratitude that they are living in a      far reaching community of belief of the transmitted Catholic      faith as defined in the Holy Scripture and the ecumenical      creeds of Nicea and Constantinople. They rejoice in their      joint recognition of the divine Revelation and their      transmission in the Catholic evidence of Holy Scripture, and      in the Apostolic tradition of the Church of all ages of which      both are an integral part.                               article II       The Reformed Episcopal Churches recognize the      ecclesiastical office as it is vested in and derived from the      Apostolic Succession and personified in the Bishops of the      Church as the legal successor of the Apostles.                              article III       The Reformed Episcopal Churches recognize that the Grace of      God is received through prayer and the faithful keeping of      the ordinances of Holy Scripture.                               article IV       The Reformed Episcopal Churches hold the conviction that      the Church in all her nuances cannot be subservient to God's      intention in the world if she is torn asunder and divided by      strife, discord and confusion to the detriment of herself or      her mentor, we not only form a part of a unique people, a      royal priesthood but the one body of Christ whose mission is      to be an anticipating and active sign of the final union of      all things, when God in Christ will be all in all.                               article V       To be shown trustworthy that the Church receives all her      life from and through Jesus Christ and the Holy Scriptures.      The various Christian denominations must help and correct      each other in spite of all differences inherent to mankind      and cooperate in all matters which relate to the mission and      welfare of the Church, known as ``The One Holy Apostolic      Church'' (Una Sancta et Apostolica Ecclesia), the spiritual      home of all who confess Jesus Christ as their Lord, Redeemer      and Saviour.                               article VI       Realizing that the above Churches live in and form a common      Catholic faith, The International Fellowship of Reformed      Episcopal Churches and God's Church International Church take      the view of declare publicly that nothing exists between the      above Churches which hinders a full communion in Sacris, so      that while continuing individually autonomous and      independent, a definite form of agreement of the above      Churches is possible. This means in fact:       a. Mutual recognition of the validity of their      administrations without any restrictions.       b. Mutual admission to Word and Ordinances.       c. Mutual aid to clergy and members of both Churches as      able, if need should arise.       d. Cooperation and consultation in the field of general      polity and ecclesiastical affairs.       e. Affiliated prelates must attend the Biannual Synodical      Convention at a time and place as indicated by the Secretary      General of the Synod.       f. Affiliated prelates must submit semi-annual reports to      the Archepiscopal offices at 20 Madison Street, Brooklyn, New      York.                              article VII       The Churches acknowledge and bow to the infallibility of      Holy Sciptures and thereby are bound by its dictates. Be it      clearly stated that no one will be ordained or elevated to      the Office of Bishop according to the Apostolic Succession      without the consent of the Archbishops, Patriarch, Primate,      Metropolitan, and President, meeting in a duly constituted      consultative Synod.       Given under our hands and seals:       duly authorized by the Universal Canons as exist in Holy      Scripture     Wilbert S. McKinley,       Patriarch.     Trevor D. Bentley,       Exarch.                          ____________________
