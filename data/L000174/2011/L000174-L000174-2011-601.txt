President, the Senate today is turning its attention to a measure that will help create jobs, energize the economy, and promote innovation. The Patent Reform Act, which has also come to be called the America Invents Act, is a key part of any jobs agenda.  We can help unleash innovation and promote American invention, all without adding a penny to the deficit. This is commonsense and bipartisan legislation. During the next few days, the Senate can come together to pass this needed legislation, and do so in a bipartisan manner. It represents the finest traditions of the Senate.  I thank the majority leader for proceeding to this measure, and the Republican leader for his cooperation.  This is a bill that was reported unanimously by the members of the Judiciary Committee. Republicans and Democrats alike recognize that it is important to our country's continued economic recovery, and to our ability to successfully compete in the global economy. America needs a 21st century patent system in order to lead. The last reform of our patent system was nearly 60 years ago, and I think it is about time the patent system caught up with the needs of this country and what the rest of the world has already done.  In his State of the Union Address, President Obama challenged the Nation to out-innovate, out-build, and out-educate. Enacting the America Invents Act is a key to meeting this challenge.  Reforming the Nation's antiquated patent system will promote American innovation, it will create American jobs, and it will grow America's economy. I thank the President and his administration for their help and support for the Leahy-Hatch-Grassley America Invents Act.  Commerce Secretary Locke has been a strong partner in our efforts, and Director Kappos of the Patent and Trademark Office has been an indispensable source of wise counsel.  Innovation drives the Nation's economy, and that entrepreneurial spirit can only be protected by a patent system that promotes invention and spurs new ideas. We need to reform our patent system so that these innovations can more quickly get to market.  A modernized patent system--one that puts American entrepreneurs on the same playing field as those throughout the world--is a key to that success. This is an idea that cuts across the political spectrum.  Our bipartisan Senate cosponsors include Senator Kohl of Wisconsin, Senator Klobuchar of Minnesota, Senator Gillibrand of New York, the distinguished Acting President pro tempore, Senator Coons of Delaware, as well as Senator Kyl, the assistant Republican leader, Senator Sessions of Alabama, Senator Lieberman of Connecticut, Senator Franken of Minnesota, Senator Blumenthal of Connecticut, and Senator Harkin of Iowa.  Republicans and Democrats from big States and small, and from all ends of the political spectrum, are coming together to support American innovation.  The Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously approved this legislation on February 3, 2011. But this effort extends back several years. Our current congressional efforts to reform the Nation's patent system began in 2005. Indeed, our bill is the product of years of work and compromise. The Senate Judiciary Committee has reported patent reform legislation to the Senate in each of the last three Congresses. And the House has seen efforts over the same period led by Congressmen Lamar Smith of Texas and Howard Berman of California. The legislation we are considering today, in fact, is structured on the original House bill and contains many of the original provisions.  From the beginning, we each recognized the need for a more effective and efficient patent system, one that improves patent quality and provides incentives for entrepreneurs to create jobs.  A balanced and efficient intellectual property system that rewards invention and promotes innovation through high-quality patents is crucial to our Nation's economic prosperity and job growth. It is how we win the future--by unleashing the American inventive spirit. This bill, the America Invents Act, will allow our inventors and innovators to flourish, and it will do so without adding a penny to the deficit.  Not a dime in taxpayer money is spent on the Patent and Trademark Office reforms. They are all funded by patent fees, not taxes.  The America Invents Act will accomplish three important goals, which have been at the center of the patent reform debate from the beginning: It will improve and harmonize operations at the Patent and Trademark Office; it will improve the quality of patents that are issued; and it will provide more certainty in litigation.  Particularly, this legislation will transition our Nation's patent system to a first-inventor-to-file system. It will also make changes to improve the quality of patents that are issued, and it will provide the PTO with the resources it needs to work through its backlog.  The America Invents Act provides the tools the PTO needs to separate the inventive wheat from the chaff, to help businesses bring new products to market and create jobs.  This is interesting because this is a piece of legislation that is supported by both business and labor--something we all want to see in this Chamber--including the National Association of Manufacturers, the United Steelworkers, the National Venture Capital Association, the AFL-CIO, the Association of American Universities, and companies representing all sectors of the patent community that have been urging action on patent reform proposals for years.  Innovation has always been at the heart of America and American success. From the founding of our Nation, we recognized the importance of promoting and protecting innovation. The Constitution explicitly grants Congress the power to ``promote the progress and science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to . . . inventors the exclusive right to their respective . . . discoveries.'' It is not a creature of the legislature but an integral part of our Constitution.  The patent system plays a key role in encouraging innovation and bringing new products to market. The discoveries made by American inventors and research institutions, commercialized by our companies, and protected and promoted by our patent laws, have made our system the envy of the world.  In spite of this, a Newsweek study last year found that only 41 percent of Americans believe the United States is staying ahead of China in innovation.A Thompson Reuters analysis has already predicted that China will outpace the United States in patent filings this year.  China has a specific plan not just to overtake the United States in patent applications, but to more than quadruple its patent filings over the next 5 years--all the more reason why we must act now. This is not something that should be delayed. We should act on it. Delaying it is saying we want China to overtake the United States. Moving forward says we want to be competitive.  It is astonishing to consider that China has been modernizing its patent laws and promoting innovation, but the United States has failed to keep pace. I said before, it has been 60 years since we last enacted reform of American patent law. We can no longer wait. We can no longer remain complacent and expect to stay on top.  In many areas that were highly contentious when the patent reform debate began, the courts have acted. Their decisions reflect the concerns heard in Congress that questionable patents were too easily obtained, too difficult to challenge. The courts have moved the law in a generally positive direction, more closely aligned with the text of the statutes.  More recently, the Federal circuit aggressively moved to constrain runaway damage awards, which plagued the patent system by basing awards on unreliable numbers, untethered to the reality of licensing decisions.  The courts have addressed issues where they can, but in some areas only Congress can take the necessary steps. Our act will both speed the application process and, at the same time, improve patent quality. It will provide the USPTO with the resources it needs to work through its application backlog, while also providing for greater input from third parties to improve the quality of patents issued and that remain in effect.  High quality patents are the key to our economic growth. They benefit both patent owners and users, who can be more confident in the validity of issued patents. Patents of low quality and dubious validity, by contrast, enable patent trolls who extort unreasonable licensing fees from legitimate businesses, and constitute a drag on innovation. Too many dubious patents also unjustly cast doubt on truly high quality patents.  The Department of Commerce issued a report indicating that these reforms will create jobs without adding to the deficit. The Obama administration supports these efforts, as do industries and stakeholders from all sectors of the patent community. Congressional action can no longer be delayed.  Innovation and economic development are not uniquely Democratic or Republican objectives, so we worked together to find the proper balance for America, for our economy, for our inventors, for our consumers.  Thomas Friedman wrote not too long ago in the New York Times that the country which ``endows its people with more tools and basic research to invent new goods and services . . . is the one that will not just survive but thrive down the road. . . . We might be able to stimulate our way back to stability, but we can only invent our way back to prosperity.''  I think of the country's first patent, which was issued to a Vermonter. Thomas Jefferson, the Secretary of State, examined the application, and President George Washington signed it.  A recent Judiciary Committee meeting on this measure was on the anniversary of the day Thomas Edison received the historic patent for the principles of his incandescent lamp that paved the way for the bulb that has illuminated our homes, offices, and venues in our country and around the world.  This week is when the patent was issued for lifesaving improvements to the diver's suit. It was magician Harry Houdini who devised a mechanism that allowed divers in distress to safely escape a diving suit.  So we can smooth the path for more interesting and great American inventions. That is what the bipartisan comprehensive patent reform bill would do.  I wish to recognize in particular the work of Senator Hatch, who is here on the Senate floor--and he has been a longtime partner of mine on intellectual property issues--and Senator Grassley, the ranking Republican on our committee. The bill has also received tremendous input from Senator Kyl, Senator Klobuchar, Senator Sessions and many others. We are working together, along with those on both sides of the aisle in the House, to reach the goal of improving patent quality and the operations at the PTO, and to address the related unpredictability of litigation that has been harming innovation.  No one claims that ours is a perfect bill. It is a compromise that will make key improvements in the patent system. Over the course of the next couple of days, the Senate will have the opportunity to consider amendments.  Senator Coburn intends to bring an amendment on the use of patent fees. Other Senators who disagree with the move to a first-to-file system may seek to reverse that progress. I urge those Senators that have amendments to come forward, agree to time agreements and proceed without delay.  We should be able to complete action on this bill this week and I would hope by Wednesday night. Then the Senate will need to move on to other important matters. So after a brief period for opening statements to outline the bill and frame the debate, I will call for Senators to come forward with any amendments they may have to the bill. This bill is important and its scheduling comes as no surprise. It was more than 10 days ago that the Senate unanimously agreed to its consideration.  So, let us do our job, and get to the task of considering and completing action on this important bill in order to help create jobs, encourage innovation and promote American invention.  Mr. President, some of the Nation's leading innovators and inventors have expressed strong support for S. 23, the America Invents Act. The Coalition for Patent and Trademark Information Dissemination, whose members are patent and trademark holders, recently wrote to the Senate Judiciary Committee in support of the bill, stating that its members have ``an interest in a more efficient system that produces higher-quality patents and trademarks.'' The Intellectual Property Owners Association, one of the largest trade associations devoted to intellectual property rights also recently wrote to Senators endorsing important provisions in the bill, including the first-to-file system. I ask that these letters, as well as a statement of support from the Coalition for 21st Century Patent Reform be printed in the Record at this time. I also ask that a list of cross-sector manufacturers and innovators that support S. 23 be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         Coalition for Patent and Trademark Information            Dissemination,                                                 February 1, 2011.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Judiciary Committee,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles Grassley     Ranking Member, Judiciary Committee,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: The      Coalition writes in support of S. 23, the Patent Reform Act      of 2011.       Coalition members are information services and workflow      solution provider companies that offer value-added patent and      trademark information services. Our services are aimed at      enabling patent and trademark applicants to find and make      available the most relevant information related to their      claimed inventions and marks through the data enhancements      and state of the art search tools provided. Members also are      patent and trademark holders with growing numbers of patent      and trademark applications who have an interest in a more      efficient system that produces higher-quality patents and      trademarks.       Patent quality is directly related to the adequacy of the      prior art presented to examiners. When applicants conduct a      patentability search and disclose all relevant prior art to      examiners, examiners will have a significantly increased      likelihood of making the right decision about patentability.      A major positive addition to patent law would be the      provisions in S. 23 allowing submission of patents or other      publications by third parties while applications are still      under consideration by the USPTO. This should further add to      the prior art made available to the examiner and has the      potential to greatly enhance patent quality.       Additionally, we applaud the inclusion of supplemental      examination provisions in the bill. This will allow patent      holders to request a review of patents where pertinent      history or information may have been intentionally omitted in      original requests. The inclusion     of this provision will further strengthen our laws to prevent      unlawful infringement.       We are delighted that a provision disallowing outsourcing      of USPTO searches no longer seems to be under consideration.      Coalition members believe that the USPTO should be able to      contract with private companies to perform searches, whether      as part of the PCT process, as is now currently permitted, or      possibly for national searches at some future time. USPTO      operational flexibility with PCT searches has proven to      drastically reduce pendency rates. Achieving quality, speed,      and cost-effectiveness in USPTO processes is a goal to      encourage. USPTO management should be empowered to use the      best source or sources for searches.       There is one addition to S. 23 that we would hope to see as      the legislation advances. Coalition members believe that full      disclosure of prior art information to examiners is      constrained by concerns about inequitable conduct liability.      We urge Congress to reform the inequitable conduct defense in      order to remove the disincentive for full disclosure of all      prior art.       We appreciate this opportunity to express our positions on      patent reform issues, and the members of the Coalition stand      ready to work with the Senate Judiciary Committee as it      considers patent reform legislation.           Sincerely,                                               Marla Grossman,                          Executive Director, Coalition for Patent     and Trademark Information Dissemination.                                  ____                                             Intellectual Property                                           Owners Association,                                                February 25, 2011.     Re amendments to S. 23, the ``Patent Reform Act of 2011''     The Hon. ____     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator ____: Intellectual Property Owners Association      (IPO) is pleased that the Senate is planning to proceed with      consideration of S. 23, the ``Patent Reform Act of 2011.''       IPO is one of the largest and most diverse trade      associations devoted to intellectual property rights. Our 200      corporate members cover a broad spectrum of U.S. companies in      industries ranging from information technology to consumer      products to pharmaceuticals and biotechnology.       We wish to give you our advice on amendments that we      understand might be offered during consideration of S. 23:       Vote AGAINST any amendment to delete the ``first-inventor-     to-file'' and related provisions in section 2 of the bill.      First-inventor-to-file, explained in a 1-page attachment to      this letter, is central to modernization and simplification      of patent law and is very widely supported by U.S. companies.       Vote FOR any amendment guaranteeing the U.S. Patent and      Trademark Office access to all user fees paid to the agency      by patent and trademark owners and applicants. Current delays      in processing patent applications are totally unacceptable      and the result of an underfunded Patent and Trademark Office.       Vote AGAINST any amendment that would interpose substantial      barriers to enforcement of validly-granted ``business      method'' patents. IPO supports business method patents that      were upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in the recent Bilski      decision.       For more information, please call IPO at 202-507-4500.           Sincerely,                                                Douglas K. Norman,     President.                                  ____                                             Intellectual Property                                           Owners Association,                                                February 25, 2011.   First-Inventor-To-File in S. 23, the ``Patent Reform Act of 2011''       Section 2 of S. 23 simplifies and modernizes U.S. patent      law by awarding the patent to the first of two competing      inventors to file in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office      (PTO), a change from the traditional system of awarding the      patent, in theory, to the first inventor to invent. First-     inventor-to-file in S. 23 has these advantages:       Eliminates costly and slow patent interferences proceedings      conducted in the PTO and the courts to determine which      inventor was the first to invent.       Creates legal certainty about rights in all patents, the      vast majority of which never become entangled in interference      proceedings in the first place, but which are still subject      to the possibility under current law that another inventor      might come forward and seek to invalidate the patent on the      ground that this other inventor, who never applied for a      patent, was the first to invent.       Encourages both large and small patent applicants to file      more quickly in order to establish an early filing date.      Early filing leads to early disclosure of technology to the      public, enabling other parties to build on and improve the      technology. (Applicants who plan to file afterward in other      countries already have the incentive to file quickly in the      U.S.)       Makes feasible the introduction of post-grant opposition      proceedings to improve the quality of patents, by reducing      the issues that could be raised in a post-grant proceeding,      thereby limiting costs and delay.       Follows up on changes already made by Congress that (1)      established inexpensive and easy-to-file provisional patent      applications and, (2) in order to comply with treaty      obligations, allowed foreign inventors to participate in U.S.      patent interference proceedings.                                  ____                                            The Coalition for 21st                                         Century Patent Reform Bipartisan Efforts Move Strong Patent Reform Bill Forward in Senate--    Coalition Supports Commitment to Improve Patent System for All                                Inventors       Washington, DC.--Gary Griswold of the Coalition for 21st      Century Patent Reform today released the following statement      after the Senate Judiciary Committee overwhelmingly approved      S. 23, The Patent Reform Act of 2011. The Coalition      appreciates the strong bipartisan support of the bill in the      committee and the recognition by the Senators that patent      reform will spur innovation and help create jobs across all      business sectors.       ``Our Coalition is grateful for the bipartisan vote in      support of the legislation and the Senators' hard work to      craft legislation that will improve the patent system for all      the nation's innovators. It is very encouraging to have the      committee's overwhelming support for the legislation as it      moves to the Senate floor. We recognize Senators will      continue to fine-tune the language of the bill and we look      forward to working actively with them to address outstanding      issues.       The members of our Coalition will be working with other      inventors and innovators in the coming weeks to communicate      with all Senators as well as members of the House about the      importance of this legislation for jobs, promoting      innovation, and solidifying our global competitiveness.''                                  ____      Cross-Sector Manufacturers & Innovators In Support of S. 23       3M, Air Liquide, Air Products, BP, Bridgestone American      Holdings, Inc., Cargill, Caterpillar, Coalition for Patent      and Trademark Information Dissemination, Coalition for 21st      Century Patent Reform, Cummins.
