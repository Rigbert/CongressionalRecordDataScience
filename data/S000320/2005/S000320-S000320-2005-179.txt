 President, I am pleased to present to the Senate the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006. Since August 25, our Nation has been gripped by the devastation and destruction left in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. We have all watched in horror as this category 4 hurricane ravaged an entire region, and each of us share in the sorrow of those who have lost their lives and their livelihoods. I am confident that the strength of the American spirit will rise to this challenge and, just as we have many times before, that we can and will recover.  The bill before us today provides funding for many U.S. Government functions that are critical to hurricane prediction, response, and recovery. The Small Business Administration provides low-interest loans to disaster victims to rebuild their homes and businesses. The Economic Development Administration, under the Department of Commerce, can make funds available to distressed communities to help repair their physical infrastructure. Under the Department of Justice, State and local law enforcement assistance grants can help provide relief to gulf coast law enforcement agencies. Finally, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is one of three lead agencies responsible for researching, forecasting, monitoring, and warning of hurricanes.  It is timely that this bill is being considered on the Senate floor, and I commend the leader for recognizing how important it is to send this bill to the President.  This afternoon, I want to take a moment to provide some general background about the bill before us and the programs it funds. The reorganization of the Appropriations Committee earlier this year significantly changed the jurisdiction of the subcommittee. The newly formed subcommittee has jurisdiction over the Departments of Justice and Commerce, as well as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Science Foundation, and a number of independent agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Small Business Administration. The major areas of jurisdiction of the CJS bill are counterterrorism, Federal, State, and local law enforcement, our Nation's economy, regulation of the banking and telecommunications sectors, scientific research, including programs to study the oceans and atmosphere, and our Nation's space program.  In a year when domestic discretionary dollars are scarce, it has been our goal to ensure that the priorities of our Nation and our States are met while remaining within our allocation. I believe we have accomplished those savings wherever possible and that we have allocated limited resources to meet the highest priority programs. These priorities include bolstering our capabilities for fighting terrorism, assisting with law enforcement activities at the State and local level, measuring and strengthening our Nation's economy, furthering scientific research, and reforming and reenergizing our Nation's space program. In the wake of three successive hurricanes last year and now Hurricane Katrina, we have also taken steps to ensure our Nation's ability to predict and monitor hurricanes. And we have done what we reasonably could within our purview to improve our response and recovery capabilities.  The total amount recommended is $885 million above the fiscal year 2005 level at this point in the debate, which is a 2-percent increase. These numbers might suggest that the bill is well below the budget request. However, the bill does not include the proposed Strengthening America's Communities Initiative. The President's budget request for the Department of Commerce included $3.7 billion to implement this new program. The bill before us does not reflect the President's proposal to transfer and significantly reduce these programs.  Another noteworthy aspect of the bill is that it includes an increase of over $1 billion above the budget request for the Department of Justice. This is mainly due to the restoration of the proposed cuts to State and local law enforcement grants. I know the Presiding Officer is very involved in that. The bill also recommends nearly $7.2 billion for the Department of Commerce, including NOAA and NIST, which is an 8-percent increase over last year's funding level. Many Department of Commerce programs were proposed for termination in the President's budget for 2006. Rather than terminating these programs, the bill before us includes funding for the Economic Development Administration, which is so important to every State, the public telecommunications facilities, planning and construction grants, and the Technology Opportunities Program.  In the science title of the bill, we have restored the 8-percent reduction from last year's enacted level that was proposed by NOAA. There is continued frustration among many of my Senate colleagues about the Department's repeated request to reduce NOAA funding. NOAA provides many critical functions to hurricane prediction and warning. Further, our oceans and atmosphere constitute one of our most precious natural resources, and I believe we can all appreciate the importance of both to human subsistence. I believe we should be increasing NOAA's budget, as the bill does, not cutting it.  In addition, this bill provides funding for NASA to move forward with the exploration vision while fully funding the ongoing activities of the space shuttle and the International Space Station.The recommendation fully funds constellation systems and provides NASA with funds to prepare a servicing mission to the Hubble space telescope. Many of NASA's facilities in the gulf region sustained significant damage from Hurricane Katrina, and we have not addressed those issues in this bill. We expect to address them in the next supplemental spending measure that will be considered.  Finally, in the related agencies title of the bill, we include full funding for the Securities and Exchange Commission, for the Federal Communications Commission. The recommendation rejects a number of proposed program eliminations within the Small Business Administration.  This, overall, is a pretty lean bill. We had to work with our allocation. We had to make tough decisions to get here. I think my colleagues will find that this bill does support core functions and even provides increases where critical. The bill addresses the most pressing needs that were brought to our attention both by the administration and by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Overall we believe we have crafted a bill that reflects the priorities of this committee, as well as of the entire Senate.  I take this opportunity to thank Senator Mikulski, my friend and colleague, who is the ranking member on the committee. We have worked together this year, as we have in many years, to produce a bill that is fair and forward looking under intense time and budget constraints. I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Mikulski on the Senate floor and in the future.  I also reiterate the leader's position, which is that we must act on this bill expeditiously. I urge my colleagues to come to the floor and offer their amendments. I will try to work with them, but let's act in a timely manner. Time is of the essence now.               Amendments Nos. 1655 through 1658, en bloc  Mr. President, I now send a series of amendments to the desk. I ask that the amendments be considered read and agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to these amendments be printed in the Record, with all of the above occurring en bloc. These amendments have been cleared on both sides of the aisle.
