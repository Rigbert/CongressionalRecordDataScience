Madam Chairman, have not we had enough violence lately? With all due respect to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Sanchez), the amendment she offers will result in babies being brutally killed by abortion and will force pro-life Americans to facilitate the slaughter of innocent children. Sanchez will turn military hospitals into abortions mills. I want no part of the carnage.  Madam Chairwoman, abortion is violence against children. Some abortion methods dismember and rip apart the fragile little bodies of children. Other abortion methods chemically poison children. There is nothing benign or ``curing'' or nurturing about abortion. It is violence.  We worry today about the agony of chemical attack. Yet abortionists routinely attack unborn children with lethal chemicals. Abortionists turn the babies spines to jelly. Abortionists turn children's bodies into burned corpses, a direct result of the caustic effect of salt poisoning and other methods of chemical abortions. It's gruesome yet the apologists sanitize the awful deed with soothing, misleading rhetoric.  Abortion methods are particularly ugly, Madam Chairman, because under the guise of choice, they turn human baby girls and baby boys into dead baby boys and baby girls. We have had enough loss of innocent life. Reject the Sanchez amendment.
