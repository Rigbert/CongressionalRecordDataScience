Speaker, I rise to honor John T. Lewis, the Director of Logistics and Support for the Chief Administrative Officer of the U.S. House of Representatives, on his upcoming retirement on June 2, 2017.  Beginning on June 1, 1978, John spent his entire thirty-nine year career with the U.S. House of Representatives and for over twenty years worked as an upholsterer. Starting as a laborer in the Clerk's office, John moved up the ranks to become a master upholsterer. One of his major accomplishments was learning how to upholster the special type of Turkish chairs used by Members of Congress. Many of these historic chairs remain in use by Members to this day.  John was then asked to take on a managerial role, serving as the Supervisor of Workflow Management, which involved developing purchasing spreadsheets and building asset tracking systems. However, after a couple of years in that position, John returned to the trade he loved in serving as the manager of the Textiles Department. In that role, John supervised the day-to-day operations of several shops, including upholstery, cabinet, finishing, drapery, and carpets.  Throughout his career, John oversaw several important projects including the redressing of the Lincoln catafalque, the replacement of the House Floor carpet, the re-upholstery of every seat on the House Floor and in the Gallery, the complete refinishing of the House Floor dais, the construction of the lecterns and stenographers' desk, and the total refurbishment of the Speaker's chair. John led or assisted in twenty Congressional transitions and ten Presidential inaugurations. Among his most significant contributions was nurturing the furnishings team and coaching its members to be some of the most talented craftsman on Capitol Hill.  In his retirement, I hope John will enjoy time spent with his wife of thirty-seven years, Lisa, and his two daughters, Joanna Emily Caputi and Lauren Elisabeth Lewis, his parents, Bill and Anne Lewis, and other members of his extended family. On behalf of the entire House, I extend my congratulations and thanks to John T. Lewis for his many years of dedication and outstanding contributions to this institution. I wish him many wonderful years ahead.                          ____________________
