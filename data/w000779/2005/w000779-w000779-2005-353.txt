All I am talking about is the original intent of a law that is on the books, which is applied primarily to the academic field--not sports.  I want it understood that I am not talking about anything new. I am talking about enforcing the law that is on the books.  Second, making sure that I am specific with respect to what the Senator from Tennessee has said, all I am talking about is that women would get an equal shot at all of the slots in math and science. We know there can be different results based upon the qualifications of an individual. And universities don't need to have the exact same number of men and women for every position on their faculties. But what I want us to do--and what title IX is all about--is make sure that women have an equal shot at all of the slots that are available. It seems to me, if we don't do that, we are not complying with the law that is on the books.  I will tell you that we are not going to be able to meet the economic and national security needs of our country.
