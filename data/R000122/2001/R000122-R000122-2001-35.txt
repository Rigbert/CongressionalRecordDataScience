President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to acknowledge a distinguished Rhode Islander and proven leader in my State's labor community, Mr. Eddie Sullivan, the President and Business Manager of the International Union of Operating Engineers, (IUOE), Local 57 in Providence.  Eddie Sullivan lives in Warwick with his wife Dolly and is a proud father of four wonderful daughters, Kim, Kimberly, Kristen, and Katherine. Mr. Sullivan was initiated into IUOE Local 57 in January of 1964, and has worked for various contractors in the State of Rhode Island as a crane operator over the years, taking part in the construction of some of Rhode Island's most significant structures. In 1976, Local 57 elected him as an Auditor, and due to his hard work appointed him as the Vice President in 1980. In just five short years, Eddie was appointed as the Business Manager and President of Local 57 in 1985 and continues to serve in this capacity today.  In addition to his various responsibilities within the labor movement, Mr. Sullivan has served as the President of the Rhode Island Building and Construction Trades Council and was elected as a Trustee of the International Union of Operating Engineers for the Northeastern States in 1991.  As Local 57 celebrates its centennial of fighting for the concerns and needs of hard working Rhode Islanders, it is only fitting to acknowledge Eddie for his decades of service to the IUOE. I would like to take this opportunity to personally extend my deep appreciation and gratitude to Eddie Sullivan for his continued hard work and leadership over the years to the labor movement, and his efforts to improving the lives of so many Rhode Islanders and their families.                          ____________________
