 I want the Senator to know what a pleasure it is for me to be able to support the Senator's amendment and also to say many, many thanks for his leadership on this issue. I am a member of his task force. He has been absolutely indefatigable in the pursuit of quality child care for the citizens of our country. I am very proud to support this amendment.  Mr. President, if I might begin by asking a quick question through the Chair. I ask the Senator from Connecticut this question: Is he aware of how many children are on the waiting list for child care facilities in the largest State in the Union?
