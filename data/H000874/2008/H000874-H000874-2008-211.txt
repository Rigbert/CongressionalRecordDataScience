Have a good weekend.  There will be no votes on Monday, but there is business on Monday. If you have a suspension bill in which you are interested, you need to be here to participate. We have agreed that there would be no votes on Monday, but there will be probably 30 suspension bills considered on Monday. Whatever votes are asked for, we will roll until Tuesday. We will be meeting Tuesday at 10 o'clock.                          ____________________
