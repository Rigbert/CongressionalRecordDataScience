I can tell the gentlemanthat in Ohio our secretary of state displayed five different technologies in our State House. I sent down a computer security team from our region in the State from all of our major universities and said, please assess the machines. These were all people involved in computer security. They came back and reported to me that of the five systems under review in Ohio, not a single one they would rate either excellent or very good in terms of both ease of use to the voter and security. That was a devastating finding to me.  Even though I voted for HAVA, I went back to the drawing boards and looked at what was going on in my State. My State at this point has received the $41 million to buy machines, to buy technology which is probably not enough money to get an optical scanner and a paper trail, but it has not received the larger amount of money it should have received, $117 million, to do the voter education and all of the work that is necessary to bring up these new systems. So even though we voted for this law, just Ohio is $66 million short in trying to bring these technologies up by next year. I wanted to place this on the Record.  Timing is vital.  While communities are waiting to find out exactly how much money they may be getting, and some others do not want to move on acquiring equipment until they are sure of how much money they will be receiving, it is important to keep in mind:  While HAVA does state that new election machines should be in place for 2004; it is possible to get an extension until the first federal election held after January 1, 2006;  But in order to get this extension, an application must be submitted no later than January 1, 2004, at this point, to the General Services Administration, providing good cause for why the exemption should be granted;  GSA did send a letter to every governor and state election director when the initial Title I money was provided last year. However, they have not yet sent out a reminder of the impending deadline.  So far, only Illinois has applied for the extension, and this request was approved last week.  Other reasons why the extension should be requested:  Gives more time to make sure that the right machines are acquired, if new machines are acquired;  Gives more time to test and verify the machines;  More importantly, it gives more time for the vote verification provisions of the Holt bill to be implemented in a fashion that will be the most efficient with respect to any new voting machine system.  And it gives more time for people to decide whether or not they actually want to buy new machines, because while HAVA provides for new machines, it does not mandate them if current voting systems can demonstrate that they meet the integrity requirements of HAVA.

Voters in Gaithersburg had an opportunity to try out the      machines yesterday at three of the city's five polling      places. Few voters, however, came out to the Asbury Methodist      Village polling place, where, historically, the highest      percentage of voters cast paper ballots.       Election officials said the low turnout could indicate that      voters in that precinct were satisfied with the touch-screen      machines last time.       ``This is better than the old system,'' said Sarah Paxton,      administrative secretary to Gaithersburg's city manager. ``It      may take a voter only 30 seconds to vote.''       Registered voters must show identification to get a      computerized card, which they then insert into the base of      the machine. Once the card is in the machine, the names of      all candidates are displayed on the screen.       Voters touch the names they are selecting. If they touch      too many names, the screen will go blank and voters will have      to start over. Once the preferred candidates are chosen, the      machine will eject the card. The voters then must turn the      card over to one of the judges who is overseeing the process.       Montgomery was one of three counties in Maryland to use the      computerized voting machines in 2001. In July, a team of      researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore found      that the underlying computer code in the machines was      vulnerable to outside parties.       After the Hopkins analysis, Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., a      Republican, ordered San Diego-based Science Application      International Corp. (SAIC) to review the system. Last month,      SAIC reported that the system, ``as implemented in policy,      procedure and technology, is at high risk of compromise.''       Mr. Ehrlich and state election officials decided the flaws      identified by SAIC could be corrected before the presidential      primary election in March. Maryland agreed to purchase $55.6      million worth of machines just days before SAIC released its      findings this summer. The machines are expected to be      installed in 19 of Maryland's 23 counties.       Last week, several members of the Maryland's General      Assembly asked for its own ``independent'' analysis that      would, among     other things, examine issues about the electronic voting      machines. That report is scheduled to be concluded before the      General Assembly convenes in January.       Despite prior reviews of the system, officials in the four      of the five cities that will be using the machines Tuesday      say they had no problems with them last Election Day. Those      cities holding elections are Takoma Park, Rockville,      Gaithersburg, Greenbelt and College Park.       ``We had no problems in the last election,'' said Catherine      Waters, city clerk of Takoma Park, where voters next week      will use the touch-screen machines to select a mayor and six      city Council members.       Voters in Greenbelt will use a different computerized      voting machine when they elect all five members to the City      Council.       ``I don't think anyone is batting an eye,'' Greenbelt City      Clerk Kathleen Gallagher said.       However, voters in College Park will not use the touch-     screen machines when they go to the polls to choose a mayor      and four council members.       ``We will be using paper ballots,'' which might be old-     fashioned but are familiar to about 10,000 registered voters,      said Yvette Allen, of the City Clerk's Office.       The municipal elections in Montgomery and Prince George's      counties are dominated by unopposed incumbents.       In Rockville, voters will decide whether to elect a mayor      and City Council every four years, instead of two. This will      be the 59th city election in the city's 116-year history,      said Neil Greenberger, the city's public information officer.       Voters in Gaithersburg will be electing three of the five      council members.
