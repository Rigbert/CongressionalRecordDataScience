 You mentioned the States. One of the things that we're very concerned about is the very substantial fiscal adverse impact to the States that will be caused by the change in the Medicaid regulations proposed by the administration. That is one of the items under consideration because that change, as I understand it from Mr. Waxman--as a matter of fact, we just talked about it--will have a very great adverse financial impact on the States. I'm sure you received a letter similar to the one that I received from both Democratic and Republican Governors asking us to address that.  So there clearly are some items which have impact on the States. Very frankly the discussion is, how many of those do we try to address, if any, in the supplemental? How many do we address in the stimulus package? Or how many do we address in separate legislation?  One of the positive aspects of the stimulus package, as you will recall because you and I were in the room, was that Secretary Paulson, on behalf of the administration, the Speaker, you and I and Mr. Boehner sat down together and talked about how we can get from where we were to where we wanted to get, and we came to agreement. We have been unable to do that, as you know, on some of these things that we think are of serious concern, and the Medicaid regulations are an example of that.
