Speaker, one of the most critical areas in need of reform is our child support enforcement and collection system. Too many absent parents are not meeting their responsibility of emotionally and financially supporting their children.  Bringing children into this world and not supporting them is an irresponsible act and it is wrong. The time has come for us to put an end to this irresponsible behavior.  Those of us who work hard and play by the rules can no longer continue supporting a system in which responsibility is abandoned. Enough is enough.  Americans expect and we need to demand that both parents support their children. We must discourage government dependence and expect every able-bodied American to be personally responsible for their actions. The previous speaker talked about that. This is not a partisan issue. This is a critical issue if America is going to succeed to build a better society for our children and generations to come.  Payment of child support should be as certain as taxes and death. Each year failure to collect child support costs our country billions of dollars and children billions of dollars.  The potential for our child support collection is estimated at around $48 billion. However, only $14 billion is actually collected. This leaves an estimated collection gap of $34 billion per year that parents are not paying to support their children and expecting the rest of us to pick up the slack.  Clearly, we need to take care of those children. But we also need to demand that parents are there first.  Moreover, half of the women eligible for child support are receiving nothing. These statistics send a clear signal that we have got a lot more work to do.  [[Page H2976]] Last week President Clinton moved us another step forward in our continuing effort to improve our Nation's child support enforcement system. I want to commend him on taking such a bold step in issuing an Executive order which will improve and expedite child support enforcement for Federal employees.  The Executive order will cross-match the names of Federal employees with Federal employment records and inform the States if there is a match. A determination will be made by the State as to whether wage withholding or other actions are necessary. The order will simplify service of process for Federal employees.  In addition, it will require every Federal agency to cooperate with the Federal parent locator service. The Executive order also cuts the time in half between the day a paycheck is garnished and the day it is received by the custodial parent.  Now, almost every Member of this body knows and my constituents know that I am a strong supporter of Federal employees and fight for their pay and benefits. But they, like others, need to be responsible. And they need to support their children.  The President has established a working model upon which the Congress can build. In the next couple of weeks I hope this House will bring a bill to the floor which contains meaningful reform to the current system.  The previous speaker talked about welfare reform   and a couple of others did as well. There is not a person in this body that does not know that welfare is broke. And the issue is, how do we fix it? How do we fix it, and, yes, expect and demand work, but also understand that to get to work, we are going to have to take actions to facilitate that transfer from dependency to independence.  Before we reach the floor for the final vote, there is still ground which can be covered such as revocation of driver's licenses for persons owing child support arrearages. While I applaud my colleagues for including child support in their welfare reform package, I am disappointed that they chose to not include this provision. The inclusion of such a provision would have the effect of again holding parents responsible for support of their children.  The State of Maine has instituted such a plan. Since implementation, the State has revoked less than 20 licenses, but because of the threat of license revocation, the State has received about 12 million additional dollars for back child support.  Just imagine how much could be collected and used to support our Nation's children if this were implemented in all 50 states.  Mr. Speaker, we all agree the child support system is in need of reform. Let us take actions in the coming weeks to make sure that children receive the support from their parents that they are due morally and legally.                          ____________________
