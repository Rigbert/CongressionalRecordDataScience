 Those of us working in Washington, DC, remember this sniper incident. Not only do I work here but my daughter lives here with my son-in-law and grandson, and they live in one of the suburbs represented by the Senator from Maryland.  I can tell you when these two snipers were moving around the area, ordinary families were living in fear. They had a sniper rifle and they were killing innocent people. Some 13 were killed and 6 were injured. Here are the photos of a few of the victims.  After this terrible sniper incident, we learned there was a gun dealer who could not even account for the gun that was used to kill these innocent people. So the survivors, as well as the victims' families, came forward and said they wanted to hold that gun dealer accountable in court for irresponsible and reckless conduct in selling firearms, in allowing them to get into the hands of these snipers. That is reasonable for the family to do. It is something I support.  But make no mistake, this bill, S. 1805, slams the courthouse door on these victims and their families. The Senator from Maryland, Ms. Mikulski, is standing here, pleading with those who bring the bill forward to keep in mind the sniper victims and their families and give them a chance to have their day in court. If the court decidesthey don't have a right to recovery, so be it. But should we pass a law to say these families do not even have a chance to go after the reckless misconduct of these gun dealers that resulted in the deaths of their loved ones? That is what this bill is all about. The Senator from Maryland has dramatized it in terms that everyone who works in this Capitol will understand.  There was a time when you couldn't go home from work, from this building, for fear of being shot in the street. It happened over and over and over again. Why in the world would the Senate pass a bill to insulate this reckless gun dealer from his civil liability for selling these guns?  I thank the Senator for her leadership.
