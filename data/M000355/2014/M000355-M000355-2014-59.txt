 President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Christian Appalachian Project, CAP, an organization that is celebrating 50 years of dedicated service to the people of Appalachia.  CAP was started by the Reverend Ralph Beiting in Eastern Kentucky. Reverend Beiting was a Catholic priest assigned to an area of Kentucky that had no Catholic church, and the organization grew out of his ability to help those in need without the organizational structure of an established church. In 1964, he started a summer camp for boys on Herrington Lake in Garrard County, thus launching the Christian Appalachian Project's now 50-year legacy.  Since that summer of 1964, CAP has grown into the Nation's 16th-largest human services charity. Among the services CAP provides are home repair and reconstruction, disaster relief, clothing drives, food relief, and--a sure sign that some things never change--summer camps.  CAP employs 160 people and has around 50 long-term volunteers. This is in addition to the host of volunteers that are drawn to community service projects like Grateful Bread, Grateful Threadz, and WorkFest.  CAP has touched the lives of thousands in Appalachia and is a model for how organizations can serve their communities. I therefore I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in honoring the Christian Appalachian Project.  Kentucky Living published an article in their September 2014 issue profiling the Christian Appalachian Project. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From Kentucky Living, Sept. 2014]    Bringing Help and Hope: Hundreds of Volunteers Working With the   Christian Appalachian Project--Now Celebrating 50 Years of Service--Bring Residents of Appalachia Dignity, Self-Worth, and Renovated Homes.                        (By Debra Gibson Isaacs)       It wasn't supposed to snow. After all, it was spring break      for the college students who had wound their way into rural      eastern Kentucky from across the nation. But the snow was      just one of many surprises this week, and like the others, it      was easily, joyfully accepted.       The students were in Kentucky for WorkFest, one of an array      of programs serving the most basic needs of the region's most      vulnerable residents--children and families, the elderly, and      individuals with disabilities--conducted by the Christian      Appalachian Project, or CAP as the nonprofit organization is      affectionately known. CAP provides home repair and      reconstruction, food, disaster relief, crisis intervention,      child development, summer camps, family advocacy, domestic      violence shelters, in-home respite, clothing, and programs      for the elderly.       With help from hundreds of volunteers, CAP has renovated      362 homes in Floyd, Jackson, Rockcastle, Clay, Owsley,      McCreary, Martin, Lawrence, and other counties during      WorkFest since the annual event began in 1992. On this day in      March, CAP volunteers were in Rockcastle County working on      four homes.       One was the home of Vincent, a member of Jackson Energy      Cooperative. Vincent had returned to Kentucky from 11 years      working for the military to find his home in need of far more      work than he could accomplish alone and with little money.       ``I am like the Beverly Hillbillies,'' 48-year-old Vincent      joked, his green eyes smiling above his mustache, a bandana      on his head and two earrings piercing his left ear. ``I      packed up everything I owned in my truck and came home. This      is home. I always come back home.''       But home had a bathroom floor that had rotted out. The      living room floor was also gone. The roof leaked. Windows had      to be replaced. Plumbing needed repair. The front porch was      close to falling down. The modest home was barely habitable.      Still, no one seemed to see the problems; they were focused      on the solutions.       Seeing the solution rather than the problem is standard      fare for CAP, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary all      year from now until August 2015. Started by the Rev. Ralph      Beiting, a Catholic priest assigned to a slice of eastern      Kentucky without a single Catholic church at the time, CAP      grew from Beiting's ingenuity in helping those around him. At      first Beiting would travel to northern Kentucky, where      friends and church families would donate all kinds of goods      and clothes, and he would distribute them to those in need.      His outsized personality soon led him into the hearts of the      people, and that led him to try to meet the many needs he      found.       The first official CAP project came in 1964--a summer camp      for boys on Herrington Lake in Garrard County. Beiting went      on to develop the concept for finding ways to help people      help themselves. He named his ministry the Christian      Appalachian Project and declared it would be ``a group that      would roll up our sleeves and get the job done.''       That same work ethic and dedication continues today, 50      years later, as the Christian     Appalachian Project goes about improving the lives of those      in Appalachia.       ``Cut it like this,'' instructs Jay G. Dresser, a CAP      volunteer for 15 years, as he takes a power saw from one of      the students to demonstrate how to notch a 2x4. A few feet      away, students are in the bathroom ripping up rotted flooring      while another group works in the bedroom. It is dark and      nippy inside the modest home, but no one seems to notice as a      happy cacophony of saws, hammers, and laughter fills the      house.       ``That's better,'' Dresser encourages. ``Push this. Now      pull the plate all the way out. Now stand it up and let me      reset the blade.''       A few miles away, a similar scene unfolds at the home of      Betty, also a Jackson Energy Cooperative member, and the      daughter and her fiance, cousin, and four grandchildren who      live with her in a mobile home that has been added to over      the years. New windows are already in place and two      volunteers are at work on the roof.       ``The kids now have a warm bedroom,'' says Betty. A fire in      the kitchen earlier had done extensive damage to another part      of the house, but she did not have the ability to repair it.      ``I just did the best I could,'' she says. ``My sister-in-law      fell through the porch and the refrigerator almost landed on      her.''       ``My son passed with leukemia when he was 32,'' Betty says,      her long brown hair now streaked with gray. ``He always told      me if he won the lottery he would bulldoze down this house      and build me a new home. I wish he was here to see this. They      have done miracles.''       Everyday miracles are what CAP has come to be known for as      it has grown into the 16th-largest human services charity in      the country with 160 employees and as many as 50 long-term      volunteers.       CAP's Housing Program, which coordinates WorkFest and      YouthFest, a spring-break alternative program for high school      students, provides home repair and reconstruction services      year-round. Permanent crews, including an experienced,      industry-trained crew leader and several long-term      volunteers, perform all types of home repairs.       Families requesting help fill out an application, which is      reviewed by a caseworker who then schedules a home visit to      assess the applicant's needs. The families go through a      budgeting process and in monthly installments pay back one-     half of the material costs (up to a maximum of 5 percent of      their income). They also donate sweat equity. All the labor      is donated for the homes that CAP builds or repairs.       Across Appalachia, similar projects are under way. A CAP-     operated food pantry called Grateful Bread warded off hunger      for 800 families last year, and Grateful Threadz, a store      accepting donations of gently used clothing, helped thousands      of individuals and families. Prescription assistance helped      709, family advocacy served 4,980, elderly services 267, and      domestic violence shelters 2,640. It is the same with      numerous other programs. In all, the organization reached      more than 50,000 people last year. Each represents a need      met, a better life.       ``We exist to serve God,'' says CAP President Guy Adams.      ``That is a high calling. How we do that is helping people in      need in Appalachia.''                          ____________________
