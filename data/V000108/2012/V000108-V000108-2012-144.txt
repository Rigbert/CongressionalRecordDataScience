Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to congratulate the members of the Hammond, Indiana Franklin D. Roosevelt Democratic Club as they celebrate the organization's 80th anniversary. In honor of this momentous occasion, the Franklin D. Roosevelt Club will be hosting an anniversary banquet on September 15, 2012 at the Restaurant at Lost Marsh in Hammond, Indiana.  The Franklin D. Roosevelt Club of Hammond, Indiana was founded by forty-two members of Polish ancestry on December 3, 1932. The Club has grown over the years, and currently consists of 110 members. The mission of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Club is to ``maintain high standards and secure the best possible candidate for the Democratic Party.'' Since its inception, club members have selflessly given their time and support to the community of Northwest Indiana. The residents of Northwest Indiana truly benefit from the Club's ``Candidates' Night,'' which is held the week before each primary and general election. This is an outstanding opportunity for voters to meet candidates and discuss with them the needs of their community. For their significant contributions to upholding the ideals of the democratic process in their communities and throughout Northwest Indiana, the members and leaders of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Club are to be highly commended.  The dedication and generosity of the Club and its members has also been evidenced over the years by their innumerable charitable acts to those in need throughout the broader community, irrespective of their political beliefs. I also must acknowledge the sheer kindness the members of the Club show to all.  I still fondly recall the first Franklin D. Roosevelt Club meeting I attended in March of 1983. I didn't know anyone in the Club when I entered St. Casimir Hall. But through the graciousness of the late President Ed Nawracaj and his wife, Sophie, as well as Wally and Paula Skibinski, Dorrie Kometz, and many others, I was welcomed as a lifelong friend and left the hall ``knowing everyone.''  The warmth a ``total stranger'' enjoyed that evening, and many to follow, remain forever in this Member's heart.  At this time, I would like to acknowledge the 2012 Franklin D. Roosevelt Club officers. They are: President Gregory J. Sanchez, First Vice President Kay Pucalik, Second Vice President Leslie Stanish, Secretary Barney Stodola, Treasurer Mary T. Hildebranski, Sergeant at Arms Brian Krupinski, Chaplain Reverend Stephen D. Kosinski, and Trustees Diana Beyer, Joe Scasny, and Rosemary Wojdyla.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating the members of the Hammond, Indiana Franklin D. Roosevelt Democratic Club on the 80th anniversary of their organization. The work of this truly admirable organization is a great asset to the people of Northwest Indiana, and for their selfless service, the leadership and members of the Club are worthy of the highest praise, and I am proud to serve as their representative in Washington, D.C.                          ____________________
