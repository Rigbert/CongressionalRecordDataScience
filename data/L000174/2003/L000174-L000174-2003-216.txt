I know it is well intentioned, but the amendment does set up cumbersome requirements for determining whether an action is to be heard in State or Federal court. It provides that a Federal judge may use five factors in deciding jurisdiction of a class action where between one-third and two-thirds of the plaintiffs are from the same State as primary defendants; and if two-thirds of the plaintiffs are from the same State as the primary defendants, then the case will stay in State court.  The bill fails to determine when this measurement takes place during the litigation. It has been my experience that membership in class actions frequently changes. So the two-thirds provision or the middle-third provision which is subject to judicial discretion could open up easily to judicial gamesmanship. The defendant could try to remove a case from State court at the discovery stage. Someone takes a deposition and finds, oops, this is going against us, let's get it out of here. Or the judge has made a ruling they do not like and they know they can never win on appeal, let's get it out of here, even after all the evidence is presented, or after closing arguments.  Actually, the way the bill is currently written, it could be done while the jury is deliberating. Considering the vast resources of defendants in many class actions as compared to plaintiffs, it will make it more difficult for class members to ever have a final ruling, where the bill will cause unnecessary and expensive litigation. It favors corporate defendants.  I like to think the scale of justice is even. This tilts the scale of justice and it will bounce right off the stand.  If there were ever a time to think about protecting the consumers, the investors, and the employees, think of Enron, WorldCom, and other corporate scandals. Think of the employees who worked so hard and were told to put their money in the corporate pension program. Look what has happened. Look at the employee investors. I am not too concerned about some of the leaders of a company like that. They might have to sell one of the $50 million homes or they no longer will have several billions of dollars but rather several hundred million, but I am worried about the people who truly had their lifesavings or their pension destroyed or their company destroyed.  This bill does nothing to make the Enrons of the world more accountable for their actions. Actually, the bill undercuts Congress's other efforts to make the companies more responsible or accountable for their misdeeds or more susceptible to penalties when they do wrong. The legislation makes it more difficult for the victims of corporate wrongdoing to join to make those companies accountable. It seems to me that is the exact opposite to the approach we should be taking.  Now, not surprisingly, consumers and those representing consumers object strongly to the enactment of this legislation.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters from numerous consumer advocates in opposition to this bill.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of America, U.S.            Public Interest Research Group,                                                 February 5, 2003.       Dear Senator: we are writing to you as organizations      dedicated to working on behalf of the rights and interests of      consumers to express our opposition to S. 274, the ``Class      Action Fairness Act of 2003.'' This legislation will deny      consumers access to adequate redress against corporate      wrongdoers and will undermine the ability of state courts to      hear cases primarily concerned with their own citizens. While      class actions are an important and efficient legal tool for      consumers to use in order to obtain redress from wrong doing,      we are concerned about abuses of the class action process and      agree that these abuses should be curtailed. However, S. 274      will not eliminate these abuses, but rather would create      barriers to a consumer's effort to obtain redress. S. 274 is      unfair to consumers and we urge you to oppose it.       Congress should work to prevent unjust enrichment by      lawyers at the expense of consumers in class action      settlements. This legislation however, will not solve this      problem. Instead, while purporting to curtail class action      abuses, S. 274 will virtually wipe out state class actions      and thus remove an important venue for redress of injury or      fraud for consumers. The bill will make it more difficult for      consumers to obtain effective and efficient judicial relief      for injuries caused by defective products, fraud in the      marketplace, or discrimination.       Congress should seek to hold negligent wrongdoers      accountable for their actions. Yet this bill does just the      opposite: it places obstacles to accountability by providing      fewer incentives for companies to keep their products safe      and their action fair.       S. 274 will create numerous barriers to participating in      class actions by permitting defendants to remove most state      class action suits to federal court. This removal from state      court to federal court would leave consumers shuttling back      and forth between state and federal court because while a      consumers' class could meet state law class certification      requirements, it could fail to meet the class certification      requirements set forth in federal law. This will result in      the federal courts' denial of class certification and      dismissal (not remand) of the case. A consumer would not have      two options, none of which would result in access to a court      proceeding. A consumer could bring the claim in state court      as an individual action. However, individual cases would be      impractical to litigate, would not have the same deterrent      effect, and would have the potential to overwhelm state      courts. In the alternative, consumers could re-file an      amended class certification in state court. This re-filing      again opens the door created by S. 274 for the defendant to      remove the case to federal court.       S. 274 will also clog an already overburdened and      understaffed federal judiciary and slow the pace of      certifying class action cases. This considerable delay will      likely result in the denial of justice to injured consumers.      In addition, this removal to federal court takes away an      important and traditional function of state courts and will      slow--and in some cases thwart--the continual interpretation      of state law. Federal court decisions on issues of state law      solve the narrow legal issue of the particular case without      providing legal precedent for future state court cases of the      particular state law in question. Further, class actions are      among the most resource-intensive cases before the federal      judiciary. U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist      has expressed concern that this bill will result in further      overloading an already-backlogged federal docket.       We agree that class actions can be made a more effective      means of consumer redress; we support changes to the class      action system that would prevent unjust enrichment and act as      a deterrent to future wrongdoing, including modification of      notice requirements and simplification of certification      procedures and standards; but the jurisdictional changes      mandated by S. 274 are designed to impede class actions, not      to make them fairer or more efficient.       This class action ``reform'' legislation is especially      inappropriate in light of recent events. Just last year in      the scandals of Enron, WorldCom and others, we saw how      corporations need to be held accountable for their actions.      Class actions effectively hold corporations accountable.       S. 274 does not provide the right solution to a class      action system in need of reform; rather it makes it more      difficult for consumers to obtain redress, to hold bad actors      accountable for the harms they caused, and to deter future      misconduct. The Class Action Fairness Act will substantially      reduce the effectiveness of one of the most important legal      tools consumers now have.       We strongly urge you to oppose S. 274. We urge you to do      the right thing for American consumers.           Sincerely,     Sally Greenberg,       Senior Product Safety Counsel, Consumers Union.     Rachel Weintraub,       Assistant General Counsel, Consumers Federation of America.     Chris Peterson,       Consumer Attorney, U.S. Public Interest Research Group.                                  ____                                            Judicial Conference of                                            the United States,                                   Washington, DC, March 26, 2003.     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,     Chair, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Dirksen          Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Hatch: I write to provide you with the      recently adopted views of the Judicial Conference of the      United States, the policymaking body for the Federal      judiciary, on class action legislation, including S. 274, the      ``Class Action Fairness Act of 2003,'' introduced by you and      other cosponsors.       On March 18, 2003, the Judicial Conference unanimously      adopted the following recommendation: ``That the Judicial      Conference recognize that the use of minimal diversity of      citizenship may be appropriate to the maintenance of      significant multi-State class action litigation in the      Federal courts, while continuing to oppose class action      legislation that contains jurisdictional provisions that are      similar to those in the bills introduced in the 106th and      107th Congresses. If Congress determines that certain class      actions should be brought within the original and removal      jurisdiction of the Federal     courts on the basis of minimal diversity of citizenship and      an aggregation of claims, Congress should be encouraged to      include sufficient limitations and threshold requirements so      that Federal courts are not unduly burdened and States'      jurisdiction over in-State class actions is left undisturbed,      such as by employing provisions to raise the jurisdictional      threshold and to fashion exceptions to such jurisdiction that      would preserve a role for the State courts in the handling of      in-State class actions. Such exceptions for in-State class      actions may appropriately include such factors as whether      substantially all members of the class are citizens of a      single State, the relationship of the defendants to the forum      State, or whether the claims arise from death, personal      injury, or physical property damage within the State.      Further, the Conference should continue to explore additional      approaches to the consolidation and coordination of      overlapping or duplicative class actions that do not unduly      intrude on State courts or burden Federal courts.''       The Conference in 1999 opposed the class action provisions      in legislation then pending (S. 353; H.R. 1875, 106th Cong.).      That opposition was based on concerns that the provisions      would add substantially to the workload of the Federal courts      and are inconsistent with principles of Federalism. The March      2003 position makes clear that such opposition continues to      apply to similar jurisdictional provisions.       The Conference recognizes, however, that Congress may      decide to base a statutory approach to remedy current      problems with class action litigation by using minimal      diversity jurisdiction. The Conference position recognizes      that the use of minimal diversity may be appropriate to the      maintenance of significant multi-State class action      litigation in the Federal courts. The use of the term      ``significant multi-State class action litigation'' focuses      on the possibility of multi-State membership within the      plaintiff class. The actions to which this term applies are      nationwide class actions, as well as class actions whose      members include claimants from States within a smaller region      or section of the country. Minimal diversity in these cases      would facilitate the disposition of litigation that affects      the interest of citizens of many States and, through their      citizens, affects the many States themselves.       Parallel in-State class actions in which the plaintiff      class is defined as limited to the citizens of the forum      State are not included within the term ``significant multi-     State class action litigation.'' Parallel in-State class      action might share common questions of law and fact with      similar in-State actions in other States, but would not, as      suggested herein, typically seek relief in one State on      behalf of the citizens living in another State. Accordingly,      parallel in-State class actions would not present, on a broad      or national scale, the problems of State projections of law      beyond its borders and would present few of the choice of law      problems associated with nationwide class action litigation.      In addition, to the extent problems arise as a result of      overlapping and duplicative in-State class actions within a      particular State, the State legislative and judicial branches      could address the problem if they were to create or utilize      an entity similar to the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict      Litigation, as some States have done.       Further, the position seeks to encourage Congress to      include sufficient limitations and threshold requirements so      as not to unduly burden the Federal courts and to fashion      exceptions to the minimal diversity regime that would      preserve a role for the State courts in the handling of in-     State class actions. The position identifies three such      factors that may be appropriately considered in crafting      exceptions to minimal diversity jurisdiction for class      actions. These factors are intended to identify those class      actions in which the forum State has a considerable interest,      and would not likely threaten the coordination of significant      multi-State class action litigation through minimal      diversity. (The factors do recognize certain situations where      plaintiffs from another State may be included in an otherwise      in-State action.)       The first factor would apply to class actions in which      citizens of the forum State make up substantially all of the      members of the plaintiff class. Such an in-State class action      exception could include consumer class action claims, such as      fraud and breach of warranty claims. The second factor would      apply to a class action in which plaintiff class members      suffered personal injury or physical property damage within      the State, as in the case of a serious environmental      disaster. It would apply to all individuals who suffered      personal injuries or losses to physical property, whether or      not they were citizens of the State in question. The third      factor recognizes that it may be appropriate to consider the      relationship of the defendants to the forum State. Such      consideration is not intended to embrace the term ``primary      defendants'' (or a similar term), which language has been      used in past and present class action bills as part of an      exception to minimal diversity. Such a reading could extend      minimal diversity jurisdiction to cases in which a single      important defendant lacked in-State citizenship. While the      relationship of the defendant to the forum may have some      bearing on State adjudicatory power, an insistence that all      primary defendants maintain formal in-State citizenship is      too limiting and may preclude in-State class actions where a      defendant has sufficient contacts with the forum State,      regardless of citizenship.       We would appreciate your consideration of these comments      and the position of the Judicial Conference. Should you or      your staff have any questions, please contact Michael W.      Blommer, Assistant Director, Office of Legislative Affairs,      Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, at (202) 502-1700.           Sincerely,                                            Leonidas Ralph Mecham,                                                        Secretary.
