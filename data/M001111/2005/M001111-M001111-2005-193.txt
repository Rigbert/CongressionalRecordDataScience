 President, the Senate is going to vote in a couple of minutes on an amendment Senator Bond and I offered that addresses fraud and abuse at HUD properties. These are technical changes that are needed to provide the HUD Office of Inspector General the tools they need to continue this effort.  The amendment clarifies that the Government can recover double damages from project owners, heirs, officers, and management companies that have violated their project agreements with HUD. These damages will apply even if the violators no longer have a mortgage or are doing business with HUD. The provision allows violations to basically be considered as a false claim. Large damage awards are a proven deterrent in minimizing fraud and abuse in these programs.  There is a backlog of enforcement actions awaiting this change, including nursing homes that have been skimming equity from properties that are covered with HUD insurance. We have to put a stop to these abuses. I encourage all colleagues, when this vote occurs in a few minutes, to support this amendment.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
