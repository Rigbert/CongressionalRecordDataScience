I rise today to recognize Douglas A. Fraser of Southfield, Michigan.  Douglas A. Fraser departed from this life Saturday, February 23, 2008 at a fulfilling 91 years old. Douglas will forever be remembered for his dedication to labor rights, as he constantly sought after fairness and justice in employment practices. Douglas led the United Auto Workers (UAW), though a period of transition in the 1970s and 1980s. As the chief of the United Auto Workers, he played an instrumental role in saving the former Chrysler Corporation from bankruptcy.  Mr. Fraser commenced his career with the auto industry by taking a job at a DeSoto plant owned by Chrysler that had been organized by the UAW. He rose rapidly in the ranks of the union, eventually being elected of Local 227, in 1944, at the age of 27. After three terms as president, in 1947 he was hired as a member of the union's international staff. In 1951, Mr. Fraser joined then UAW President Walter Reuther's staff. Because of skills at negotiation, he quickly became known for his shrewd bargaining ability.  Respected for being both an artful politician and an impassioned activist, Mr. Fraser was one of the first labor leaders to take on many of the thorny issues facing the auto industry today, from global competition to soaring health costs.  Without Mr. Fraser's aggressive lobbying on Capitol Hill and among UAW rank and file, Chrysler would not have been able to secure $1.5 billion in federal loan guarantees in 1979, which saved the automaker from bankruptcy, according to labor historians and top UAW officials. Also, in the 1979, as president of the UAW, Mr. Fraser and his team achieved other breakthroughs: Incremental increases in pension benefits for current and future retirees, a substantial increase in reduced work time, improvements in the cost-of-living allowance formula, and Chrysler agreement to union representation on its board of directors.  In 1980, Mr. Fraser became the first American union official to sit on the board of a large corporation. He even donated his board salary to Wayne State University in Detroit.  Current UAW President Ron Gettelfinger, who has led the union through a period of labor challenges in the face of the financial downturn of the automotive ``Big Three'', said he often turned to Mr. Fraser for guidance and support.  Once Mr. Fraser retired as UAW president in 1983, he became a professor of labor studies at Wayne State and launched another career that spanned 25 years. In that capacity, he served as a guest faculty member at other campuses, including the University of Michigan, Harvard University and Columbia Business School, where he was labor leader in residence for 3 years.  It is with the deepest appreciation that I pay tribute to the long life of a hard-working, just and passionate man, Douglas Fraser. He lived his years in service to his family, friends and fellow United Auto Workers. May this ardent labor leader be showered with blessings into eternity and receive a loving peace.                          ____________________
