The history of the Bachan family of East Chicago, Indiana, and their commitment and service to the United States of America, is a true source of pride in Northwest Indiana. The Bachans represent a great model of unwavering patriotism.  Natives of East Chicago, these local heroes served and were stationed in many locations, including Korea, Germany, and Vietnam. For a single family to offer so much in defense of our freedom, they are to be commended with the highest praise and admiration. The men I stand to honor today are: Paul Bachan, Milan Bacan, Richard Bacan, Michael Bacan, the late Joseph Bachan, Daniel Bachan, Robert Bachan, and Steven Darryl Mihailovich, as well as their brothers-in-law, Donald Knieriemen, a veteran of the United States Navy, and the late Henry Butch Haluska, a veteran of the United States Air Force.  To further demonstrate their desire to serve their country, two of these men, Joseph and Robert Bachan, chose to make careers of their service. Joseph served his entire military career in the United States Army, the branch where all of the brothers served, while Robert split his time serving both in the United States Army and the United States Navy.  It came as no surprise to those who knew the Bachan boys that these men would make the decision to serve their country. These men grew up together in East Chicago and always felt tremendous pride for their country, knowing all too well the dangers that would exist if they chose to enlist. Undeterred, they would go on to serve their country with selfless sacrifice and bravery. Their courage and heroism will always be remembered, and their sacrifice, along with the sacrifice of all of our veterans, lives on in the hearts and minds of all Americans. Surely, it is through the service of brave citizens like the Bachan brothers that we can enjoy the freedoms and values we so dearly treasure today.  Madam Speaker, at this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring these fine individuals. Let us never forget their service and the sacrifices they made to preserve the ideals of freedom and democracy. I can say with certainty that Northwest Indiana is proud to be the home of the Bachan family.                          ____________________
