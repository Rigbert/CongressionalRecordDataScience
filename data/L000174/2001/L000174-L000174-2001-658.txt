President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a number of editorials regarding his nomination from the New York Times, USA Today, the Akron Beacon Journal, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Jan. 27, 2001]                           What Ashcroft Did                           (By Anthony Lewis)       Boston.--Even some conservatives are embarrassed now by the      way Senator John Ashcroft killed the nomination of Ronnie      White to be a federal judge. He told his Republican      colleagues that Judge White, of the Missouri Supreme Court,      had shown ``a tremendous bent toward criminal activity.'' It      was a baseless smear.       But it was not just dirty politics. It was dangerous, in a      way that casts doubt on Senator Ashcroft's fitness to be      attorney general.       Judge White was attacked by Senator Ashcroft because, in 59      capital cases before the Missouri court, he had voted 18      times to reverse the death sentence. In 10 of those 18 the      court was unanimously for reversal. Senator Ashcroft hit at      cases in which Judge White dissented.       For appraisal of Judge White's record in those cases I rely      on Stuart Taylor Jr. of The National Journal, a conservative      who is widely respected as a legal analyst. He wrote: ``The      two dissents most directly assailed by Ashcroft in fact exude      moderation and care in dealing with the tension between      crime-fighting and civil liberties.''       One of the dissents was in a horrifying murder case--the      murder, among others, of a sheriff. Mr. Taylor wrote that      Judge White's ``conclusion was plausible, debatable, highly      unpopular (especially among police) and (for that reason)      courageous. For John Ashcroft to call it `pro-criminal' was      obscene.''       In short, a judge who wrote a thoughtful, reasoned dissent      in a murder case was told that it disqualified him for a      federal judgeship. Think about what that means for our      constitutional system.       Judicial independence has been a fundamental feature of the      American system for 200 years and more. We rely on judges to      enforce the Constitution: to protect our liberties. But a      judge who does so in a controversial case is on notice from      John Ashcroft that he may be punished. The judge must reject      the constitutional claim, however meritorious, or face a      malicious smear.       There is a slimy feel to Senator Ashcroft's behavior with      Judge White. One of the Republicans who voted against the      judge at Senator Ashcroft's urging, Arlen Specter of      Pennsylvania, told Judge White the other day, ``the Senate      owes you an apology.'' Commentators have urged Senator      Ashcroft to apologize, but he has refused.       That same sense of slipperiness is evident in another      matter: Senator Ashcroft's role in blocking the nomination of      James Hormel to be ambassador to Luxembourg in 1998. Mr.      Hormel is gay. Senator Ashcroft explaining his opposition,      said Mr. Hormel ``has been a leader in promoting a      lifestyle,'' and that was ``likely to be offensive'' in      Luxembourg.       But 10 days ago, when Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat of      Vermont, asked whether he had opposed Mr. Hormel because he      is gay, Senator Ashcroft replied, ``I did not.'' Why, then,      had he opposed the nomination? Senator Leahy asked.       ``Well frankly,'' Senator Ashcroft replied, ``I had known      Mr. Hormel for a long time. He had recruited me, when I was a      student in college, to go to the University of Chicago Law      School [where Mr. Hormel was then an assistant dean]. . . . I      made a judgment that it would be ill advised to make him an      ambassador based on the totality of the record.''       After that testimony, Mr. Hormel wrote Senator Leahy that      he had not ``recruited'' Mr. Ashcroft or anyone to Chicago,      which needed no recruiting; that he could recall no personal      conversation with Mr. Ashcroft then and had not seen him for      nearly 34 years. He added that he had asked to talk with      Senator Ashcroft in 1998 about the Luxembourg nomination but      had gotten no response.       Trying now to appear as someone who will act equitably to      all, Senator Ashcroft was not man enough to admit that he had      opposed Mr. Hormel because of his sexual orientation. He      resorted instead to the false suggestion that he was well      acquainted with Mr. Hormel over decades and his ``record''      was bad.       Supporters of Senator Ashcroft say it is improper to object      to him because of his ideolgy--a president should be free to      have cabinet members of whatever ideology he chooses. Even      with the greatest latitude for     the cabinet, Senator Ashcroft's extreme-right politics make      him a dubious choice for attorney general. But what makes      him, finally, unfit for the job is that, in Stuart Taylor's      words, ``A character assassin should not be attorney      general.''                                  ____                  [From the USA Today, Jan. 26, 2001]             Ashcroft Rights Record Bears Careful Watching       our view: his testimony said one thing; his record another       When Senate Democrats forced postponement of a vote      Wednesday on a confirmation of John Ashcroft, it was less a      victory than a delay of the inevitable. Ashcroft will be      attorney general. But whether Ashcroft will perform that      office's most vital role--protecting citizens against abuses      of power they can't combat themselves--remains very much in      doubt.       History has shown this to be the most lasting      accomplishment of many attorneys general. Herbert Brownell      Jr., who served Dwight D. Eisenhower, advised federal      intervention when the doors to a Little Rock school were      barred to the first black students. As John F. Kennedy's      attorney general, Robert Kennedy led the government's fight      against racial violence in the South. And most recently,      Janet Reno worked to assure women their constitutional right      to an abortion free from threat or violence.       There will be quick and ample opportunity for a confirmed      Ashcroft to show such leadership on everything from voting to      abortion rights. But the troubling questions remain: Will the      nation get the man of measured views portrayed at his recent      confirmation hearings? Or the ferocious ideologue who served      in the Senate and as Missouri's attorney general and      governor?       Ashcroft said all of the right things about being willing      to uphold the law. But grudgingly upholding it and actively      fighting for it are very different. Ashcroft's long public      record raises questions about his commitment, which were      enhanced at hearings last week when he distorted, evaded and      strained credulity in key areas, particularly civil rights:       Fighting integration. Ashcroft has shown no inclination to      fight for civil rights and indeed battled for years against a      voluntary St. Louis busing plan that grew out of a lengthy      court case. Assertions at last week's hearings that he favors      integration were undercut when he twisted his own record.       Ashcroft told senators that Missouri was not a party to the      desegregation lawsuit, that it was ``found guilty of no      wrong'' and that when ``the court made an order, I followed''      it. All distortions. The state was sued in 1977, Ashcroft's      first full year as attorney general. Judges repeatedly found      state officials liable, once calling them ``primary      constitutional wrongdoers.'' A federal judge threatened      contempt proceedings against the state for defying orders.      And in 1984, another judge wrote, ``if it were not for the      state of Missouri and its feckless appeals, perhaps none of      us would be here.''       Meanwhile, according to news accounts, Ashcroft rode the      case to higher office: He bragged about his unbridled      opposition and the threatened contempt citation. And he ran a      scathing TV ad suggesting that a GOP primary opponent was too      soft on busing.       Insensitivity on race. Ashcroft's Missouri history doesn't      mean he's an overt racist. Money was at issue as well as      integration in the St. Louis case. But he certainly seems      indifferent to minority concerns. Given ample opportunity to      explain his acceptance of an honorary degree from Bob Jones      University, a bastion of racial bias, and his praise for a      neo-Confederate magazine, Ashcroft offered limp evasions. He      ``should do more due diligence'' on the magazine, he said,      and he'll continue to speak at places here he can ``unite      people.'' That doesn't sound like a man who would use the      power of his office to fight racial bias.       Ideology over justice. Ashcroft, who ferociously opposed      several Clinton nominees with whom he differed ideologically,      displayed no better sense of fairness even as he sought      Senate approval.       He repeated his harsh attack on an African-American      Missouri Supreme Court judge, whom he had labeled ``pro-     criminal.'' Ashcroft torpedoed the judge's 1999 nomination to      the federal bench even though the judge voted to uphold 70%      of the death sentences he reviewed. Also, Ashcroft evaded      specific questions about opposition to Clinton nominee James      Hormel as ambassador to Luxembourg. According to news      accounts, Ashcroft criticized Hormel, a gay businessman, for      supporting ``the gay lifestyle.''       Presidents get, and in most cases deserve, wide latitude to      pick a top team that reflects their philosophy, but that      comes with a price: They bear responsibility for their      appointees' actions. President Bush, who can't afford to      offend minority voters by abandoning civil rights, may hold      tight rein on the Justice Department. Moreover, much will      depend on those named to key jobs just below attorney      general, particularly the department's civil rights chief.      Those nominees deserve particular scrutiny.       Ashcroft himself faces several early tests of his      commitment to fairness. He'll decide whether the U.S.      government pursues allegations of voter discrimination in      Florida in the presidential election. He'll help determine      whether race has been used wrongly to draw new congressional      districts nationwide. He'll play a major role in picking new      federal judges and potentially Supreme Court justices. And      he'll influence the nation's stand on future restrictions on      abortion and on the use of race in government hiring and      college admissions.       If Ashcroft indulges ideology over fairness, Bush will      surely pay the price. But so, too, would Americans who most      need the law's protection. That would be the real tragedy.                                  ____             [From the Akron Beacon Journal, Jan. 24, 2001]  The President's Man--The Ugly Story of the Ronnie White Nomination       Reveals What a Disappointing Choice George W. Bush Has Made       Trent Lott has declared that John Ashcroft will easily win      confirmation as attorney general. The Senate Judiciary      Committee was expected to vote today. That has been      postponed. Still, the forecast of the Senate majority leader      will likely prove true in a week or two. A majority of      senators will consent to the choice of George W. Bush.       A president deserves to surround himself with Cabinet      officers and advisers in whom he has confidence. That is part      of even the slenderest mandate a president may win. It      ensures that responsibility for an administration falls on      the person who occupies the Oval Office.       Those who've described the confirmation hearings on the      Ashcroft nomination as among the toughest ever forget the      raucous sessions over Clarence Thomas and Robert Bork, to      name just two. The politics involved have been plain. The      president hoped to reassure arch conservatives with his      choice. Liberal interest groups have kept their own lists,      noting the performance of Democratic allies in the Senate.       All of the clatter might have been dismissed as business as      usual until Ronnie White, the first black man to sit on the      Missouri Supreme Court, testified at the confirmation      hearing. Bill Clinton appointed White to a position on the      federal district court. In 1999, Sen. Ashcroft, a fellow      Missourian, almost singlehandedly defeated the White      nomination, and the way he did so raises questions about his      judgment.       Ashcroft misled his colleagues. He rallied law enforcement      organizations to oppose the White nominations, all the while      leaving the impression they had come forward on their own. He      grossly distorted the White record, describing the judge as      ``pro-criminal'' and ``with a tremendous bent toward criminal      activity.'' He painted the portrait of a judge determined to      reverse death sentences.       In truth, White voted to uphold the death penalty in 41 of      59 cases before the Missouri high court. He sided with the      majority in 53 of those cases. Ashcroft defended his      opposition last week, arguing that he considered the      ``totality'' of the judge's record. If anything, that record,      as White quietly and powerfully made obvious, has reflected      sound reasoning and a dedication to the law (as many police      groups acknowledge).       Sen. Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican, felt the      duty to apologize to White for the way he had been treated.      The judge framed the issue of Ashcroft's nomination: ``The      question for the Senate is whether these misrepresentations      are consistent with the fair play and justice that you all      would require of the U.S. attorney general.''       The White nomination doesn't tell the entire story of John      Ashcroft. As a former state attorney general, governor and      senator, he is highly qualified to lead the Department of      Justice. He has governed from the center and with integrity,      enforcing the law whether he has agreed with its direction or      not.       His zealotry has also been front and center. He has yet to      explain clearly his opposition to James Hormel to be      ambassador to Luxembourg, except to suggest that he was      offended because the nominee was gay. He persisted in playing      racial politics with a lengthy school desegregation case in      St. Louis.       The Ashcroft record raises the question: Why didn't George      W. Bush nominate someone else to be attorney general, someone      who better reflected the themes of his inaugural address,      conservative, yes, but far less polarizing and tempted by      expediency? Fair play? Justice? John Ashcroft is the      president's man.                                  ____           [From the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Jan. 25, 2001]                         A Question of Fitness                            attorney general       John D. Ashcroft has spent the better part of his political      career at odds with core values of the Constitution--     equality, religious freedom, judicial independence and      individual autonomy. Now he is nominated to be the people's      guardian of those values. The conflict between his record and      the duties of the office raises serious questions as to      whether John Ashcroft should be confirmed as attorney      general.       Disagreeing with Mr. Ashcroft is not reason enough to      oppose him. Presidents are entitled, generally, to their pick      of Cabinet members. if Mr. Ashcroft were the nominee for      secretary of agriculture there would be no problem. But the      attorney general vets federal judges, enforces civil rights      laws, safeguards the reproductive rights of women and      determines the legal position of the United States.       Can Mr. Ashcroft fairly vet federal judges when he believes      the judiciary is full of ``renegade judges'' who have created      a ``judicial tyranny'' where courts are ``nurseries for     vice?'' Can he guard judicial independence when he has      repeatedly denied judgeships for political reasons? Can he      enforce the civil rights laws when he has doggedly fought      school desegregation, affirmative action and gay rights? Can      he protect women seeking abortions when he considers abortion      murder?       John Ashcroft is indisputably a man of principle. The      problem is those principles put him at odds with the      Constitution, with contemporary notions of equality and with      the mainstream of the American public.                         judicial independence       Judicial independence is the rock that anchors our      judiciary. But Mr. Ashcroft has undermined independence with      his attacks on judicial nominees.       Mr. Ashcroft's hostility to judicial independence is an      important lesson of the much-told story about his opposition      to Ronnie White as a federal judge. Mr. Ashcroft may have      been motivated by a feud with Mr. White over abortion policy.      But by basing his attack on Judge White's death penalty      decisions, Mr. Ashcroft sent a chill through the ranks of      state judges hoping to be promoted to the federal bench. Mr.      Ashcroft said Mr. White was ``pro-criminal'' because he had      voted to overturn death sentences. In fact, Mr. White had      upheld 35 of the 55 death sentences.       Mr. Ashcroft focused on Judge White's lone dissent to the      conviction of James R. Johnson in the gruesome murder of a      sheriff, two sheriff's deputies and a sheriff's wife. Judge      White spoke of his ``horror at this carnage'' and said      Johnson ``deserved to die'' if he was not insane. But he      concluded that Johnson's lawyer was so incompetent that he      had not received effective counsel.       A lone dissent in the case that arouses such public passion      is the essence of judicial independence. Charles Blackmar, a      retired Supreme Court judge, called Mr. Ashcroft's attack      ``tampering with the judiciary.''       Mr. White is not a perfect man, nor is he the nation's      keenest jurist. But he upheld the highest values of a judge      in his dissent. Will Mr. Ashcroft reject for the federal      bench those judges with the temerity to overturn a death      sentence?       Mr. Ashcroft's record in Missouri raises similar questions.      Judicial nominees say that Mr. Ashcroft asked them their      views about abortion before deciding whether to nominate      them.                              civil rights       Mr. Bush says that Mr. Ashcroft ``has a strong civil rights      record.'' As evidence he cites Mr. Ashcroft's appointment of      eight African-Americans to Missouri judgeships, a past      commendation from the Mound City Bar Association, an      endorsement by the Limelight newspaper, his support of      Lincoln University and his signing of bills honoring Martin      Luther King and establishing Scott Joplin's home as a      historic site.       The appointment of eight black judges is a substantive      accomplishment. The rest is resume padding. Mr. Ashcroft was      only marginally involved in the Scott Joplin house. The      Limelight is a free, marginal publication, by no means the      largest or most influential African-American newspaper in St.      Louis. The Mound City Bar Association, a black lawyers'      group, does not support Mr. Ashcroft because of the      ``insidious'' way he killed Mr. White's nomination.       The actual Ashcroft civil rights record is weak and      regressive. As state attorney general he denied that the St.      Louis schools were segregated. He lobbied members of the      Reagan Civil Rights Division to switch sides in the St. Louis      school desegregation case, and eventually became the      desegregation plan's chief opponent.       That plan offered responsible politicians the chance to      support phased, voluntary desegregation. But Mr. Ashcroft      insisted on calling it ``mandatory busing'' and leveled a      devastating anti-busing TV ad at his opponents in the 1984      governor's race. U.S. District Judge William L. Hungate      summed up Mr. Ashcroft's behavior as ``feckless,'' saying he      ``voluntarily rode (the desegregation) bus to political      prominence.''       In 1997 Mr. Ashcroft led the opposition to Bill Lann Lee,      the Asian-American head of the Civil Rights Division. First,      he distorted Mr. Lee's position on affirmative action, saying      he favored quotas. Then, he said Mr. Lee should be rejected      for holding a position at odds with the Supreme Court's, when      in fact Mr. Lee favored affirmative action in limited cases      where the Supreme Court said it could be used.       In 1999 Mr. Ashcroft accepted an honorary degree from Bob      Jones University, a fundamentalist Christian college that      banned interracial dating until last March. Mr. Ashcroft's      claim that he did not know about the university's      discriminatory policies stretches credulity. The college's      tax exempt status was a huge controversy during the Reagan      administration.       Mr. Ashcroft's civil rights record raises serious doubts      about his commitment to ``equal protection'' under the law--a      seed of liberty scarified by the flames of the Civil War and      brought to fruition by the civil rights movement.                     women and reproductive freedom       Mr. Bush says Mr. Ashcroft ``has a solid record'' on      women's issues, citing his appointment of Ann Covington to      the Missouri Supreme Court and his support for money to      combat violence against women.       But the Women's Political Caucus ranked Mr. Ashcroft last      in the nation for appointing women while he was governor of      Missouri. As Missouri's attorney general, he opposed the      Equal Rights Amendment. When the National Organization for      Women boycotted Missouri for opposing the amendment, he      stretched antitrust laws to sue the group.       In every office that he has held, Mr. Ashcroft has fought      abortion. He supported a Human Life Amendment even before Roe      v. Wade. In his view, Roe and its ``illegitimate progeny have      occasioned the slaughter of 35 million innocents.''       As Missouri's attorney general, he personally sought to      limit abortion in an argument to the Supreme Court. As      governor, he signed the law that led to the 1989 Supreme      Court decision that came within one vote of overturning Roe.      Mr. Ashcroft has said his top priority is the Human Life      Amendment; it would only allow an abortion to save the life      of the mother. There would be no exception for rape or      incest. Nor could states pass laws permitting abortion. Its      tenet that life begins at conception raises questions about      the legality of birth control pills, IUDs and the abortion      drug RU-486, which Mr. Bush may also seek to restrict.       Mr. Ashcroft has supported a partial birth abortion bill      that does not include an exception for the health of the      mother, even though the Supreme Court says that exception is      required.       Mr. Bush says he does not think the nation is ``ready'' to      overturn Roe and says he will focus on bills such as one      outlawing partial birth abortion. Mr. Bush and Mr. Ashcroft      have also said they will uphold the law protecting women's      access to abortion clinics. But Mr. Ashcroft would have ample      room as attorney general to advocate positions that would      undermine Roe. And he could help pick Supreme Court justices      who would read it out of the Constitution.                           religious freedom       Organized prayer in the public schools is unconstitutional.      The First Amendment says the government can't tell us when or      how to worship. Yet Mr. Ashcroft has long supported organized      school prayer. He also supports school vouchers, as does Mr.      Bush, that would direct large sums of public money to church      schools. As attorney general, Mr. Ashcroft would have the      lead role in developing the administration's legal arguments      in favor of vouchers. His opposition to four decades of      Supreme Court decisions raises questions as to whether he      believes in the boundary between church and state.       Perhaps, in several hours of testimony before the Senate      Judiciary Committee this week, Mr. Ashcroft can explain why      the nation should not feel uneasy with his stewardship of      values and principles at war with his own. Perhaps he can      reassure the American people that he will enforce principles      he has spent a quarter of a century--his entire career in      public life--fighting. But how could a man swear to uphold      constitutional values he rejects, without betraying his own      core beliefs? And who would place his trust in a man willing      to do so?       Mr. Ashcroft should certainly have a chance to explain how.      But if Mr. Bush wanted a uniter, not a divider, he has the      wrong man at Justice.                                  ____           [From the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Jan. 24, 2001]  Ashcroft: Still No--Senate Hearings Don't Alter the Case Against Him       The Senate Judiciary Committee could vote as early as today      on the nomination of former Missouri Sen. John Ashcroft to be      U.S. attorney general. Before last week's hearings by the      committee, the Post-Gazette suggested that Mr. Ashcroft was      the wrong man for the job. Nothing that transpired in the      hearings changed our view.       It is true that Mr. Ashcroft, who was nominated by      President Bush as a gesture to religious conservatives,      assured senators he would enforce laws he didn't agree with.      He even made a specific commitment not to seek a reversal of      Supreme Court decisions legalizing abortion, which he called      ``settled law.''       Almost four years ago, in a lecture to the Heritage      Foundation, Mr. Ashcroft had a different description of the      high court's abortion rulings. Referring to a 1992 decision      reaffirming Roe vs. Wade, he complained that in that ruling      ``the Supreme Court challenged God's ability to mark when      life begins and ends.'' In the same lecture, he echoed a      familiar conservative critique of what he called ``appalling      judicial activism.''       As we observed before, the question is not whether Mr.      Ashcroft can put aside his history of being an extreme critic      of the federal courts and of some of the statutes and court      decisions he will have to enforce. The question is why the      Senate should force him to perform the intellectual      contortions that transformation would require.       In raw political terms, it made sense for George W. Bush,      who received significant support from the religious right in      his election campaign, to make what one of his aides called a      ``message appointment'' that would please that constituency.      Senators who see the world differently--like Pennsylvania's      Arlen Specter--are under not obligation to follow suit by      confirming Mr. Ashcroft.       Yet Mr. Specter went on record early saying he would      support Mr. Ashcroft ``unless something extraordinary''      developed in the confirmation hearings. Predictably, no such      ``smoking gun'' materialized. Moreover, the witness Ashcroft      opponents had most counted on, Missouri Supreme Court Judge      Ronnie White, while eloquent, was in some ways a      disappointment. Judge White, an African American, declined an      opportunity to impute     racism to then-Sen. Ashcroft's disgraceful derailment of his      nomination to the federal bench.       But the issue wasn't whether Mr. Ashcroft is a racist. It      was that he unfairly distorted Judge White's record by      branding him as ``pro-criminal.'' That charge is more      understandable in the context of Mr. Ashcroft's general      attitude toward judges he considers appalling activists and      subverters of the divine will.       There is no need to impugn Mr. Ashcroft's integrity or his      legal skills to oppose his nomination. Unlike other Cabinet      officers, the attorney general is beholden not just to the      president who appoints him but also to a body of law that, in      many respects, is uncongenial to John Ashcroft but vital to      women, minorities and other Americans who find his      demonization of the courts bizarre.       It was symbolism that led President Bush to nominate Mr.      Ashcroft; senators who are uncomfortable with that      symbolism--Arlen Specter among them, we hope--should reject      the nomination.
