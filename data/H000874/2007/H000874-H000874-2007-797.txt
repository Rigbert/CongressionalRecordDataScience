 On April 25, 1507, German cartographer Martin Waldseemueller and Vautran Ludd, Chaplain to the Duke of Lorraine, created a map that gave the name ``America'' to the new world discovered by Christopher Columbus 15 years earlier. According to historical accounts, the name was a tribute to Amerigo Vespucci, a Florentine navigator who made 4 voyages to the new world between 1497 and 1504.  Waldseemueller and Ludd published 1,000 copies of the map that first coined the term ``America,'' and I am proud to say that the only surviving copy--a priceless relic of our shared heritage--now resides in the Library of Congress, after being purchased in 2003 from the German Prince Waldburg-Wolfegg for $10 million.  In the 500 years that have passed since the word ``America'' was first used, the term has become more of an idea than a name--a concept that celebrates what is best about humanity; a principle that defines what liberty, justice and unity are really all about; and a goal for the people of the world to strive towards.  We have come a long way over the last half-millennium--from a name on a piece of paper to a moral, political and economic leader among nations. And it gives me great pride to mark this momentous occasion on the House Floor and to join people all over the world in celebrating the fifth centenary of the word ``America''--a notion that now means so much to so many people from all walks of life.                          ____________________
