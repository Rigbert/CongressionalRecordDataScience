Speaker, I rise this morning to inform the house that one of America's heroes died on Wednesday.  After a battle with cancer, retired U.S. Secret Service Agent Rufus W. Youngblood died at the age of 72 in Savannah, GA.  Agent Youngblood was awarded the Treasury Exceptional Service Award in recognition of his outstanding courage and voluntary risk of personal safety in protecting the Vice President on November 22, 1963 in Dallas, TX. He was riding in Vice President Lyndon Johnson's limousine when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated.  When Rufus Youngblood retired from the Secret Service in 1971, he was the Deputy Director of the Service. Agent Youngblood joined the Service in 1951 and had a distinguished career including his service in the Presidential and Vice Presidential Protective Divisions.  A World War II Army Air Force veteran, Rufus Youngblood was always there when his country called. Our Nation is the better for his service and we all share in the loss of this American hero. He is survived by his wife and four children and I know my colleagues in the Congress join me in sending our deepest sympathies and thanks to his family.  Mr. Speaker, God was truly blessing America when he gave us Rufus Youngblood.                          ____________________
