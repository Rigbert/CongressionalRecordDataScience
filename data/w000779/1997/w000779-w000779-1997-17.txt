President, my first official act as a new U.S. Senator, taken 15 minutes after I was sworn in, was to become a sponsor of the bipartisan campaign finance reform bill that the U.S. Senate will begin to vote on later today.  I strongly believe that political campaigns should be about people and not money. But that is not what is happening in America today. Campaign finance activity has become like the arms race--one side gets $10, the next side gets $20, the other side comes back and gets $30. It spirals up and up--spending that is out of control, spending that is simply unaccountable to voters.  Every Member of the U.S. Senate has devoted hours and hours to fundraising. Every Member of the U.S. Senate knows that when there is an election that Tuesday in November, folks sleep in on Wednesday, and then in November it starts all over again. Every Member of the U.S. Senate knows that America deserves better.  I don't agree with every part of the McCain-Feingold bipartisan campaign finance legislation; I would not pretend otherwise. And I think that is true of many of the sponsors of this legislation. But if this bipartisan bill passes, candidates in America are going to spend more time talking to voters in shopping malls and less time working the phones raising funds. That is going to be good for democracy in America, and I hope the Senate passes this bipartisan bill.  I yield the floor.
