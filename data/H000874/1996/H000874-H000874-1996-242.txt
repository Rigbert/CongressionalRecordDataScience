Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments, and would echo his words, that there is no partisanship in the grief. Each and every one of us in this House, representing every American, will grieve for the loss of such a brave and gracious and warm and capable human being.  I am glad to yield to my friend from Indiana.  Mr. McINTOSH. Mr. Speaker, I too wish to express a sense of deep loss and regret. When the news traveled through our office, I did not personally know Admiral Boorda, but my father-in-law, Captain Robert McManis, served with him in the Navy in his 30 years, and he often told me of the admirable traits that Admiral Boorda brought to that job, of his true and deep compassion for the sailors in our Navy, of his abiding faith in the U.S. Navy, as the defender of freedom in this country. And I appreciate your kind words in expressing on behalf of all of us here in Congress that deep sense of loss and regret that came to us when we heard of this tragedy today.
