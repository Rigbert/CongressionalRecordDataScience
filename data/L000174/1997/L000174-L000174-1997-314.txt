President, I will not use all of that time, only to say this. We will advise and consent so the President can ratify this treaty. I truly believe we will. It will show the moral leadership that the Senate should show and that the United States should show. We will act as the conscience of this Nation, and we will advise and consent to this treaty. We will show the moral leadership because we began this by saying we would act unilaterally, if need be, renouncing our own use of chemical weapons with or without a treaty. That was true leadership.  Not all countries are going to join with us. But most did join with us on this, and we should be proud of that leadership that brought them together. We will never have all of the countries with us, but we know that it is in the best interests of the United States to do this.  I suggest, after we do this, Mr. President, that we should again look at the question of antipersonnel landmines and show the same moral leadership to get countries to join with us--not all countries will--to ban antipersonnel landmines which kill and injure far more people than chemical weapons.  Mr. President, I will vote for advice and consent of this treaty so the President can ratify it.  I yield the remainder of my time.
