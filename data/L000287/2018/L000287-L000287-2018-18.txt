Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I am prepared to close.  Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill and a necessary bill. Again, I thank the chair, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bishop), the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. DelBene), and all of our colleagues for their hard and good work. We should be very, very proud of the process and the product. I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
