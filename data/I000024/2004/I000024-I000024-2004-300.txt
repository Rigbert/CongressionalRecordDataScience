He will have ample time to come back and do that. I appreciate him allowing us to get back to the bill.  The Senator from Ohio has an amendment to talk about, but I encourage all Members to come down to the floor. We have time now. Later on, time is going to become very precious. As I said last Friday, come to the floor. We stayed open all weekend to work with Members on their amendments. We are doing that as we speak. We would encourage Members to come down and talk about their amendments--now that we have worked out amendments--so when the appropriate time comes, if they wish to file those amendments and to debate them and get votes on them, they will be light-years ahead if they come down now.  I want to issue that as a very strong suggestion to those members who have amendments. I thank some 30 Members who brought their amendments down over Saturday. A lot of those have been accepted in the managers' amendment.
