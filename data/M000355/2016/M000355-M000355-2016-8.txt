 President, let me give everyone the state of play. First, I will be offering a consent request to set the continuing resolution votes at 10 o'clock.  Having said that, I ask unanimous consent that not withstanding the provisions of rule XXII, at 10 p.m., the Senate vote on the cloture motion with respect to the House message to accompany H.R. 2028. I further ask that if cloture is invoked, all time postcloture be considered expired and Senator McCain or his designee be recognized to offer a budget point of order, and that if the point of order is raised, the motion to waive be considered made and the Senate vote on the motion to waive without any intervening action or debate. I further ask that if the motion to waive is agreed to, the motion to concur with further amendment then be withdrawn and the Senate vote on the motion to concur in the House amendment.
