Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.  First of all, if it does cause inconvenience, that is unfortunate, but saving a child's life from the cruelty of abortion, dismemberment, chemical poisoning is worth inconvenience. I know these votes are inconvenient, but that is just a simple fact of the matter.  Let me also point out that during the Reagan and Bush years we provided more than 40 percent of the population control family planning funds going around the world with the Mexico City Policy intact. What we had was contraception, birth control, separated from abortion, and that is all our amendment does. It does not expand or contract the pool of funds available for population planning.
