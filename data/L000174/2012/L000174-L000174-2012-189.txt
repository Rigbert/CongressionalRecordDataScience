President, I yield to no Member of this body in the fact that I uphold not only the rules but the courtesies of this Senate. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I have never cut off a Member of the other party who wished to speak, unlike some of the procedures they followed when they held the chair. I have never refused to have a Member of the other party bring up an amendment, contrary to the procedures they followed when they chaired it.  I believe in the Senate. I believe in the rules of the Senate, but especially I believe in the comity that Thomas Jefferson believed in, in this body; otherwise, the Senate would fall apart.  I yield the floor.
