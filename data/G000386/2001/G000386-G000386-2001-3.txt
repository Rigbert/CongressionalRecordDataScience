 President, I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a portion of a November 13 memo from Democracy Corps regarding the economic stimulus proposals.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Politics After the Attack--A Report on Democracy Corps' New National Survey and Focus Groups                           *   *   *   *   *                         the economic stimulus       Voters do not currently bring a strong partisan filter to      the various economic proposals being considered. Nonetheless,      a majority support every Democratic proposal; in fact, two-     thirds favor every Democratic proposal but one (the tax      rebate). Overall, the Democratic proposal does better than      the Republican--particularly those features that have led the      public debate, like the Alternative Minimum Tax.       Across the Democratic and Republican packages, the      strongest support is for unemployment benefits for the newly      unemployed; delaying tax cuts for the wealthiest one percent      in order to fund rebuilding and Social Security; funding      ready-to-go infrastructure to create jobs; accelerating      already scheduled broad middle class tax cuts; Cobra health      insurance for the newly unemployed; and tax incentives for      business if clearly linked to new investment.       The public rallies to four elements of the Democratic plan.      The starting point is the immediate construction program,      including airport improvements and school modernization to      create jobs. That has the broadest support (85 percent) and      nearly the most intense--48 percent strongly supportive.       There is strong support for delaying the tax cuts for the      top one percent (those earning more than $375,000 a year) in      order to fund the rebuilding and security and to make sure we      do not keep borrowing from the Social Security trust fund.      Two-thirds of the electorate favors this proposal, but most      important, more than half (51 percent) strongly favor it--the      highest for any Democratic proposal. One person noted that      they used to laugh about the ``Social Security lock box,''      ``Well, there it goes. . . . Well, that's all our money.''      That sentiment reverberated across the groups: ``It's not      their money anyhow''; ``that's what we paid into for our own      security, [and] that's not something they should say, well,      we got this money here, we can use it however we want.'' And      some said, ``I mean don't delay, just eliminate that tax cut      for these people.''       Cobra coverage health care for the newly unemployed stands      out, on its own, as a very important thing to do at this      moment. People understand the rising cost of health care and      how expensive coverage can be for anyone.       It is important to underscore that three-quarters of the      public favors a Democratic proposal for business tax      incentives to encourage investment in new plants and      equipment. The public wants tax breaks, including for      business, if the provision is linked to investment, not      simply consumption. People are looking for initiatives,      consistent with this new period. One of the participants      observed, ``The tax cut is tied to investment to encourage      them to move forward, not just a blanket.''       Unemployment benefits for the newly unemployed are      immensely popular. When offered by the Republicans and      targeted at those who have lost their jobs after September      11th, 85 percent favor the idea, including 53 percent who      strongly favor it. Presented with an expansive Democratic      proposal--extending benefits to 26 weeks, while raising      weekly benefits and covering part-time employees--more than      two-thirds support it, but less enthusiastically.       In the focus groups, many participants worried that such an      expansive proposal might re-open the old welfare system. That      is why the unemployment proposals should be part of a broad      Democratic economic package.       On taxes, voters offer a fairly consistent posture, whether      offered by Democrats or Republicans. They support business      tax cuts, even a capital gains tax cut, when it includes the      wording, ``in order to encourage investment.'' Voters seem to      support an accelerated schedule for tax cuts aimed at the      middle class--such as the marriage penalty. But there is      little enthusiasm for the tax rebate whether proposed by      Democrats or by Republicans--just 56 percent. The weak      reaction to the rebate reflects our earlier observations--a      citizenry focused on addressing the community's crisis and      long-term needs, rather than simply throwing money at      individuals to consume now.       Cuts in corporate tax rates, with no immediate spur to      investment, gets little support (46 percent). Repeal of the      Alternative Minimum Tax, providing $25 billion in tax cuts      for large businesses wins the support of only 28 percent.      When presented specifically with tax cuts for IBM, GE and      General Motors, voters are simply incredulous. Now the      leading element of the House Republican package, this is      likely to shape public perceptions of the Republicans'      approach to the economy. This may become one of the      substantive elements in the public's desire to balance the      President's direction.
