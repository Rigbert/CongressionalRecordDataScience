President, I ask unanimous consent that my opinion memorandum relating to the impeachment of President Clinton be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the opinion memorandum was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [In the Senate of the United States sitting as a Court of Impeachment]Opinion Memorandum of United States Senator John F. Reed, February 12,                                   1999                             i. conclusion       Based on the evidence in the record, the arguments of the      House Managers and the arguments of counsels for the      President, I conclude as follows: The President has disgraced      himself and dishonored his office. He has offended the      justified expectations of the American people that the      Presidency be above the sordid episodes revealed in the      record before us. However, the House Managers have failed to      prove that the President's conduct amounts to the      Constitutional standard of ``other high Crimes and      Misdemeanors'' subjecting him to removal from office.                       ii. statement of the case       On December 19, 1998, the United States House of      Representatives passed H. Res. 611,\1\ ``Impeaching William      Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States, for high      Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' The House Resolution contains two      Articles of Impeachment declaring that, first, the President      committed perjury before a Federal Grand Jury on August 17,      1998, and, second, the President obstructed justice in      connection with the civil litigation of Paula Jones.\2\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \1\ H. Res. 611, 105th Cong., 2d Sess., (1998) (enacted).     \2\ In the course of deliberations in the House, no witnesses      to the underlying events were called. The House Judiciary      Committee held four hearings and called only one material      witness, the Independent Counsel, Kenneth Starr. Mr. Starr      testified that he was not present when any of the witnesses      testified before the Grand Jury. The President's attorneys      were allowed two days to present their defense, and they      called a series of expert witnesses.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Pursuant to Article I, Section 3 of the United States      Constitution, the United States Senate convened a Court of      Impeachment on January 9, 1999, and each Senator took an oath      to render ``fair and impartial justice.'' \3\ As Alexander      Hamilton stated in Federalist No. 65, ``what other body would      be likely to feel confidence enough in its own situation to      preserve, unawed and uninfluenced, the necessary impartiality      between an individual accused and the representatives of the      people, his accusers?'' \4\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \3\ Rule XXV, Procedure and Guidelines for Impeachment Trials      in the United States Senate, Prepared by Floyd Riddick and      Robert Dove, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., S. Doc. 99-33 (August 15,      1986) at 6.     \4\ The Federalist No. 65, at 398 (Alexander Hamilton)      (Clinton Rossiter, ed., 1961) (Emphasis in original).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       The obligation of the Senate is to accord the President, as      the accused, the right to conduct his defense fairly and,      while respecting the House's exclusive Constitutional      prerogative to bring Articles of Impeachment, to put the      House to the proof of its case. At the core of our task is      the fundamental understanding that our system of government      recognizes the rights of defendants and the responsibilities      of the prosecution to prove its case. Such a basic tenet of      our law and our experience as a free people does not      evaporate in the rarified atmosphere of a Court of      Impeachment simply because the accused is the President and      the accusers are the House of Representatives.       The House of Representatives submitted a certified, written      record of over 6,000 pages. By unanimously adopting S. Res.      16, on January 8, 1999, the Senate agreed to proceed with the      Court of Impeachment based on ``the record which will consist      of those publicly available materials that have been      submitted.'' The Senate Resolution also provided that,      following the presentations of the House managers, the      response of the President's attorneys, and a period of      questions by Senators, it would be in order to consider a      Motion to Dismiss and a Motion to Depose Witnesses.       On January 27, 1999, the Senate voted 56 to 44, against      dismissing the Articles of Impeachment. On the same day, by      the same margin, the Senate passed a resolution, S. Res. 30,      allowing the Managers to depose three witnesses: Ms. Monica      S. Lewinsky,     Mr. Vernon E. Jordan, Jr., and Mr. Sidney Blumenthal. These      depositions were taken on February 1, 2, and 3, 1999,      respectively.       After Senators were provided an opportunity to view the      videotaped depositions, the Senate reconvened as a Trial of      Impeachment on February 4, 1999. At that time a motion by the      House Managers to call Ms. Lewinsky to the floor of the      Senate as a witness was rejected by a vote of 30 to 70.      Voting 62 to 38, the Senate agreed to permit portions of the      video to be used on the floor of the Senate during both a      six-hour ``evidentiary'' session and for closing arguments.      The White House declined to offer a motion to call witnesses.      The Senate then rejected a motion by Democratic Leader      Daschle to proceed directly to a vote on the Articles of      Impeachment.       On Saturday, February 6, 1999, the Senate heard six hours      of presentation, evenly divided, concerning the evidence      obtained in the three depositions. On Monday, February 8,      1999, the Senate heard closing arguments from the House      Managers and Counsel for the President. The following day,      the Senate voted on a motion to open deliberations to the      public. That motion received 59 votes, several short of the      supermajority required to change Senate Impeachment Rules.      The Senate then voted to adjourn to closed deliberations. A      final vote was taken on the Articles on Friday, February 12,      1999.                    iii. the constitutional standard       ``The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all      Impeachments.'' \5\ With these few words, the Framers of the      Constitution entrusted the Senate with the most awesome power      within a democratic society. We are the final arbiters of      whether the conscious and free choice of the American people      in selecting their President will stand.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \5\ U.S. Const., art. I, Sec. 3, cl. 7.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     1. ``Other High Crimes and Misdemeanors''       The Constitutional grounds for Impeachment indicate both      the severity of the offenses necessary for removal and the      essential political character of these offenses. ``The      President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the      United States shall be removed from Office on Impeachment      for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high      Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' \6\ The clarity of ``Treason'' and      ``Bribery'' is without doubt. No more heinous example of an      offense against the Constitutional order exists than betrayal      of the nation to an enemy or betrayal of duty for personal      enrichment. With these offenses as predicate, it follows that      ``other high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' must likewise be      restricted to serious offenses that strike at the heart of      the Constitutional order.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \6\ U.S. Const., art. II, Sec. 4.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Certainly, this is the view of Alexander Hamilton, one of      the trio of authors of the Federalist Papers, the most      respected and authoritative interpretation of the      Constitution. In Federalist No. 65, Hamilton describes      impeachable offenses as ``those offenses which proceed from      the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the      abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature      which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL,      as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the      society itself.'' \7\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \7\ The Federalist No. 65, at 396 (emphasis in original).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       This view is sustained with remarkable consistency by other      contemporaries of Hamilton. George Mason, a delegate to the      Federal Constitutional Convention, declared that ``high      Crimes and Misdemeanors'' refer to ``great and dangerous      offenses'' or ``attempts to subvert the Constitution.'' \8\      James Iredell served as a delegate to the North Carolina      Convention that ratified the Constitution, and he later      served as a Justice of the United States Supreme Court.      During the Convention debates, Iredell stated:---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \8\ Max Farrand, ed., The Records of the Federal Convention      of 1787, at 550 (1966).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       ``The power of impeachment is given by this Constitution,      to bring great offenders to punishment. . . . This power is      lodged in those who represent the great body of the people,      because the occasion for its exercise will arise from acts of      great injury to the community, and the objects of it may be      such as cannot be easily reached by an ordinary      tribunal.''\9\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \9\ Jonathon Elliot, Debates on the Adoption of the Federal      Constitution at 113 (1974).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Iredell's understanding sustains the view that an      impeachable offense must cause ``great injury to the      community.'' Private wrongdoing, without a significant,      adverse effect upon the nation, cannot constitute an      impeachable offense. James Wilson, a delegate to the Federal      Constitutional Convention and, like Iredell, later a Supreme      Court Justice, wrote that Impeachments are ``proceedings of a      political nature . . . confined to political characters, to      political crimes and misdemeanors, and to political      punishments.'' \10\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \10\ Michael J. Gerhardt, The Federal Impeachment Process: A      Constitutional and Historical Analysis at 21 (1996).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Later commentators expressed similar views. In 1833,      Justice Story quoted favorably from the scholarship of      William Rawle in which Rawle concluded that the ``legitimate      causes of impeachment . . . can have reference only to public      character, and official duty . . . In general, those      offenses, which may be committed equally by a private person,      as a public officer, are not the subject of      impeachment.''\11\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \11\ 2 Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution      Sec. 799 at 269-70 quoting William Rawle, A View of the      Constitution of the United States at 213 (2d ed. 1829).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       This line of reasoning is buttressed by the careful and      thoughtful work of the House of Representatives during the      Watergate proceedings. The Democratic staff of the House      Judiciary Committee concluded that: ``[b]ecause impeachment      of a President is a grave step for the nation, it is to be      predicated only upon conduct seriously incompatible with      either the constitutional form and principles of our      government or the proper performance of constitutional duties      of president office.''\12\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \12\ Constitutional Grounds for Presidential Impeachment,      Report by the Staff of the Impeachment Inquiry, House Comm.      on Judiciary, 93rd Cong., 2d Sess. at 26 (1974).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       This view was echoed by many on the Republican side.      Minority members of the Judiciary Committee declared: ``the      Framers . . . were concerned with preserving the government      from being overthrown by the treachery or corruption of one      man. . . . [I]t is our judgment, based upon this      constitutional history, that the Framers of the United States      Constitution intended that the President should be removable      by the legislative branch only for serious misconduct      dangerous to the system of government.''\13\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \13\ Impeachment of Richard M. Nixon, President of the United      States, Report of the House Comm. on the Judiciary, 93rd      Cong., 2d Sess., H. Rep 93-1305 at 364-65 (Aug. 20, 1974)      (Minority Views of Messrs. Hutchinson, Smith, Sandman,      Wiggins, Dennis, Mayne, Lott, Moorhead, Maraziti and Latta).---------------------------------------------------------------------------     2. The Constitutional Debates       Adding impressive support to these consistent views of the      meaning of the term, ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' is the      history of the deliberations of the Constitutional      Convention. This history demonstrates a conscious movement to      narrow the terminology as a means of raising the threshold      for the Impeachment process.       Early in the debate on the issue of Presidential      Impeachment in July of 1787, it was suggested that      impeachment and removal could be founded on a showing of      ``malpractice,'' ``neglect of duty'' or ``corruption.''\14\      By September of 1787, the issue of Presidential Impeachment      had been referred to the Committee of Eleven, which was      created to resolve the most contentious issues. The Committee      of Eleven proposed that the grounds for Impeachment be      ``treason or bribery.''\15\ This was significantly more      restricted than the amorphous standard of ``malpractice,''      too restricted, in fact, for some delegates. George Mason      objected and suggested that ``maladministration'' be added to      ``treason and bribery.''\16\ This suggestion was opposed by      Madison as returning to the vague, initial standard. Mason      responded by further refining his suggestion and offered the      term ``other high Crimes and Misdemeanors against the      State.''\17\ The Mason language was a clear reference to the      English legal history of Impeachment. And, it is instructive      to note that Mason explicitly narrowed these offenses to      those ``against the State.'' The Convention itself further      clarified the standard by replacing ``State'' with the      ``United States.''\18\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \14\ 2 Farrand, The Records of the Federal Convention of      1787, at 64-69.     \15\ Id.     \16\ Id.     \17\ Id. (emphasis added).     \18\ Id.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       At the conclusion of the substantive deliberations on the      Constitutional standard of Impeachment, it was obvious that      only serious offenses against the governmental system would      justify Impeachment and subsequent removal from office.      However, the final stylistic touches to the Constitution were      applied by the Committee of Style. This Committee has no      authority to alter the meaning of the carefully debated      language, but could only impose a stylistic consistency      through, among other things, the elimination of redundancy.      In their zeal to streamline the text, the words ``against the      United States'' were eliminated as unnecessary to the meaning      of the passage.\19\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \19\ Id.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       The weight of both authoritative commentary and the history      of the Constitutional Convention combines to provide      convincing proof that the Impeachment process was reserved      for serious breaches of the Constitutional order which      threaten the country in a direct and immediate manner.     3. The Independence of Impeachment and Criminal Liability       Article One, Section three of the United States      Constitution provides that ``[j]udgment in Cases of      Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from      Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office or      honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party      convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to      Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to      Law.'' \20\ As James Wilson wrote, ``[i]mpeachments, and      offenses and offenders impeachable, [do not] come . . .      within the sphere of ordinary jurisprudence. They are founded      on different principles; are governed by different maxims;      and are directed to different objects; for this reason, the      trial and punishment of an offense on an impeachment, is no      bar to a trial and punishment of the same offence at common      law.'' \21\ The independence of the Impeachment process from      the prosecution of crimes underscores the function of      Impeachment as a means to remove a President from office, not      because     of criminal behavior, but because the President poses a      threat to the Constitutional order. Criminal behavior is not      irrelevant to an Impeachment, but it only becomes decisive if      that behavior imperils the balance of power established in      the Constitution.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \20\ U.S. Const., art. I Sec. 3, cl. 7 (emphasis added).     \21\ James D. Andrews, ed., The Works of James Wilson at 408      (1896).---------------------------------------------------------------------------     4. Conclusion       Authoritative commentary on the Constitution, together with      the structure of the Constitution allowing independent      consideration of criminal charges, makes it clear that the      term, ``other high Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' encompasses      conduct that involves the President in the impermissible      exercise of the powers of his office to upset the      Constitutional order. Moreover, since the essence of      Impeachment is removal from office rather than punishment for      offenses, there is a strong inference that the improper      conduct must represent a continuing threat to the people and      the Constitution. It cannot be an episode that either can be      dealt with in the Courts or raises no generalized concerns      about the continued service of the President.                       iv. judicial impeachments       The House Managers urge that the standards applied to      judges must also be applied identically to the President.      Their argument finds particular urgency with respect to      Article I and its allegations of perjury. Several judges have      been removed for perjury, and the House Managers suggest that      this experience transforms perjury into a per se impeachable      offense.\22\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \22\ For example, both Judge Walter L. Nixon, Jr. and Judge      Alcee L. Hastings were convicted on charges based in perjury.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       This reasoning disregards the unique position of the      President. Unlike Federal judges, the President is elected by      popular vote for a fixed term. Popular elections are the most      obvious and compelling checks on Presidential conduct. No      such ``popular check'' is imposed on the Judiciary. Federal      judges are deliberately insulated from the public pressures      of the moment to ensure their independence to follow the law      rather than a changeable public mood. As such, Impeachment is      the only means of removing a judge. Moreover, the removal of      one of the 839 Federal judges can never have the traumatic      effect of the removal of the President. To suggest that a      Presidential Impeachment and a judicial Impeachment should be      treated identically strains credulity.       There is an additional Constitutional factor to consider.      The Constitution requires that judicial service be      conditioned on ``good Behavior.'' \23\ This adds a further      dimension to the consideration of the removal of a judge from      office. Although ``good Behavior'' is not a separate grounds      for Impeachment, this Constitutional standard thoroughly      permeates any evaluation of judicial conduct.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \23\ ``The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts,      shall hold their Offices during good Behavior . . .'' U.S.      Const., art. III, Sec. 1.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       We expect judges to be above politics. We expect them to be      inherently fair. We expect their judgment to be unimpeded by      personal considerations. And, we demand that their conduct,      both public and private, reflect these lofty expectations.      Judges are subject to the most exacting code of conduct in      both their public life and their private life.\24\ Without      diminishing the expectations of Presidential conduct, it is      fair to say that we expect and demand a more scrupulous      standard of conduct, particularly personal conduct, from      judges. A large part of these heightened expectations for      judges emerges directly from their particular role in our      government. They immediately and critically determine the      rights of individual citizens. The fates and lives of      individual Americans are literally in their hands. They      personify more dramatically than anyone, including the      President, the fairness and reasonableness of the law. Should      they falter, the foundation of ``equal justice under law'' is      more seriously strained than the failings of any other      citizen.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \24\ The Judicial Conference of the United States publishes a      Code of Conduct for United States Judges, as prepared by the      Administrative Office of the United States Courts. Cannon 2      of the Code requires federal judges to ``avoid impropriety      and the appearance of impropriety in all activities.''      (March, 1997). This Cannon requires a Judge to act at all      times in ``a manner that promotes public confidence in the      integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.'' Perceived      violations of the Code could result in a complaint to the      Judicial Conference, which can make referrals to the House      Judiciary Committee.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       The differences between a Presidential Impeachment and a      judicial Impeachment are not merely theoretical. The Senate      treats a Presidential Impeachment differently from a judicial      Impeachment in both procedure and substance. The Senate      routinely allows a select committee to receive testimony in      the trial of a judge.\25\ Such a delegation of responsibility      would be unthinkable in the trial of a President. But of even      more telling effect are the substantive differences between      Presidential and judicial Impeachments. For example, Judge      Harry Claiborne was Impeached and removed subsequent to his      criminal conviction for filing a false income tax return.\26\      In contrast, the inquiry into the Watergate break-in      disclosed similar violations of the Federal Tax Code by      President Nixon. Yet, the Judiciary Committee of the House of      Representatives declined to approve an Article of Impeachment      with respect to President Nixon's apparent violation of the      Internal Revenue Code. A major factor in declining to press      this Article was the widespread feeling that such private      misconduct was not relevant to a Presidential Impeachment.      According to Representative Ray Thornton (D-AR), ``there      [had] been a breach of faith with the American people with      regard to incorrect income tax returns . . . But . . . these      charges may be reached in due course in the regular process      of law. This committee is not a tax court nor should it      endeavor to become one.'' \27\ Republican Representative Tom      Railsback (R-IL) pointed out that there was ``a serious      question as to whether something involving [the President's]      personal tax liability has anything to do with his conduct of      the office of the President.'' \28\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \25\ Rule XI, Procedure and Guidelines for Impeachment Trials      in the United States Senate, Prepared by Floyd Riddick and      Robert Dove, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., S.

(Statement of Congressman Railsback).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       The reconciliation of this disparate treatment is found by      once again recalling the Constitution and not by simply      adopting the facile notion that if Impeachment applies to      judges then it must apply identically to the President. The      function of Impeachment is to remove a ``civil officer'' who      so abuses the particular duties and responsibilities of his      office that he poses a threat to the Constitutional order.      Furthermore, the Constitution provides an additional      condition on the performance of judges with the ``good      Behavior'' standard. The particular duties of the Judiciary      together with their obligation to demonstrate ``good      Behavior,'' renders comparison with the President inexact at      best.\29\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \29\ Various legal scholars and authoritative commentary make      this point. In support of the ``Judicial Integrity and      Independence Act,'' which would have established a non-     Impeachment procedure for removing judges, Senator Lott      submitted an article by conservative legal scholars Bruce      Fein and William Bradford Reynolds. Messrs. Fein and Reynolds      concluded ``federal judges are also subject to Article III      Sec. 4, which stipulates that judges shall serve only during      `good Behavior.' This is a stricter standard of conduct than      the Impeachment standard. . . .'' 135 Cong. Rec. S15269      (daily ed. July 19, 1989) (quoting Fein and Reynolds, Judges      on Trial: Improving Impeachment, Legal Times, October 30,      1989.) Senator Lott also submitted a statement, by then      Assistant Attorney General William Rehnquist, supporting      similar legislation in 1970, which stated that ``the terms      `treason, bribery and other high Crimes and Misdemeanors' are      narrower than the malfeasance in office and failure to      perform the duties of the office, which may be grounds for      forfeiture of office held during good behavior.'' 135 Cong.      Rec. S 15270 (daily ed. July 19, 1989) (quoting The Judicial      Reform Act: Hearings on S. 1506 Before the Subcomm. on      Improvements in Judicial Machinery of the Comm. on the      Judiciary, 91st Congress, 2d Sess. (April 9, 1970) (Statement      of Asst. Attorney General William H. Rehnquist, Office of      Legal Counsel)).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       The Managers' argument is ultimately unpersuasive. Rather      than reflexively importing prior decisions dealing with      judicial Impeachments, we are obliged to consider the      President's behavior in the context of his unique      Constitutional duties and without the condition to his tenure      of ``good Behavior.''                        V. the standard of proof       Judicial proceedings, by definition, resolve an issue in      dispute. A party seeks an outcome, provided for by the rule      of law, and petitions for that result. The petitioning party      has the burden of producing evidence. After hearing the      evidence, the trier of fact, to some degree of certainty,      reaches a conclusion. The critical factor is often the degree      of certainty necessary.       American jurisprudence utilizes three standards of      certainty: evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, clear and      convincing evidence, and a preponderance of the evidence. The      standard is determined by the gravity of the issue in dispute      and the degree of harm resulting from an incorrect decision.       Generally, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, or to a moral      certainty, is required to convict an individual of a criminal      offense. Black's Law Dictionary defines reasonable doubt as      ``a doubt as would cause prudent men to hesitate before      acting in matters of importance to themselves.'' \30\ Sample      federal jury instructions provide that ``[a] reasonable doubt      is a doubt based upon reason and common sense--the kind of      doubt that would make a reasonable person hesitate to act.      Proof beyond a reasonable doubt, must, therefore, be proof of      such a convincing character that a reasonable person would      not hesitate to rely and act upon it in the most important of      his or her own affairs.'' \31\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \30\ Black's Law Dictionary at 1265 (6th ed. 1990) (citing      U.S. v.

Finally, general civil cases, which pit private      parties against each other, are adjudicated on the      preponderance of the evidence, i.e., more likely than not.      Frequently the burden of proof is determinative of the      outcome.       In an Impeachment Trial, each Senator has the obligation to      establish the burden of proof he or she deems proper. The      Founding     Fathers believed maximum discretion was critical for Senators      confronting the gravest of constitutional choices.      Differentiating Impeachment from criminal trials, Alexander      Hamilton argued, in Federalist No. 65, that Impeachments      ``can never be tied down by such strict rules . . . as in      common cases serve to limit the discretion of courts in favor      of personal security.'' \32\ In this regard, Hamilton also      recognized that an Impeached official would be subject to the      comprehensive rules of criminal prosecution after      Impeachment.\33\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \32\ The Federalist No. 65, at 398.     \33\ Id. at 399.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Senate precedent maintains this discretion. In the 1986      Impeachment Trial of Judge Claiborne, the Senate      overwhelmingly rejected a motion by the Judge to adopt      ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' as the standard of proof      necessary to convict and remove.\34\ That vote has been      interpreted by subsequent courts of Impeachment as ``a      precedent confirming each Senator's freedom to adopt whatever      standard of proof he or she preferred.'' \35\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \34\ 132 Cong. Rec. S15507 (daily ed. October 7, 1986).     \35\ Gerhardt, The Federal Impeachment Process: A      Constitutional and Historical Analysis, at 42 (1996).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       The constitutional gravity of an Impeachment trial suggests      that the evidentiary bar be high. As I have discussed      previously, the Founders viewed Impeachment as a remedy to be      utilized only in the gravest of circumstances by a      supermajority of Senators. The Constitution gives to the      people the right to remove a President through the electoral      process every four years. Only in the most extreme of      examples, when the constitutional order is threatened, is      Congress to intervene and remove our only nationally      elected representative. Nullification of a popularly      elected President is a grave action only to be taken with      high certainty.       Constitutional analysis strongly suggests that in a      Presidential Impeachment trial a burden of proof at least      equivalent to ``clear and convincing evidence'' and more      likely equal to ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' must be      employed.\36\ Had the charges of this case involved threats      to our constitutional order not readily characterized by      criminal charges, I would have been forced to further parse      an exact standard. However, for all practical purposes, the      Managers have themselves established the burden of proof in      this case.\37\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \36\ See Charles L. Black, Jr., Impeachment: A Handbook, at      14-19 (1974)     \37\ The adoption of a standard of ``beyond a reasonable      doubt'' in this matter should not be construed as implying      that the same standard must be utilized in each and every      Impeachment proceeding. Conduct of ``civil officers'' in the      performance of their official duties might pose such an      immediate threat to the Constitution that a less exacting      standard could properly be used. Any choice of a standard of      proof must, at a minimum, consider the nature of the      allegations and the impact of the alleged behavior on the      operation of the government.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       The Articles, embodied in H. Res. 611, accuse the President      of perjury and obstruction of justice. This allegation of      specific criminal wrongdoing is repeated in their Trial      Brief.\38\ Indeed, in their presentation, the Managers have      stated, ``none of us, would argue . . . that the President      should be removed from the office unless you conclude he      committed the crimes that he is alleged to have committed. .      . .'' \39\ The House Managers invited the Senate to arrive at      a conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt before voting to      convict the President. I take them at their word.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \38\ Trial Memorandum of the United States House of      Representatives, In Re Impeachment of President William      Jefferson Clinton, [hereinafter HMTB] (Submitted pursuant to      S. Res. 16) at 1.     \39\ 145 Cong. Rec. S260 (daily ed. Jan. 15, 1999) (Statement      of Mr. Manager McCollum).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       After reading their Trial Brief, listening to their      presentation of the evidence, viewing depositions, and      considering their closing argument, I conclude that the      President is not guilty of any of the allegations beyond a      reasonable doubt. I reach this conclusion mindful of the      admonishment of the Founders that Impeachment is not a      punitive, but rather a constitutional remedy. Having      concluded that the charges, even if proven, do not rise to      the level of ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' an analysis of      the specific charges is unnecessary. However, given the      gravity of the charges alleged, an explanation is      appropriate.                  vi. perjury allegations of article i       Article I alleges that the President committed perjury      before a federal Grand Jury on August 17, 1998. The charge      must be measured against the fact that the full House of      Representatives rejected an article of Impeachment charging      the President with perjury in a civil deposition. House      Judiciary Committee Republicans, citing case law, have      asserted that ``perjury in a civil proceeding is just as      pernicious as perjury in criminal proceedings.'' \40\ The      Article before the Senate is further undercut by the fact      that the Article fails to site, with specificity, testimony      alleged to be false.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \40\ Impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton, President of      the United States, Report of the Comm. on the Judiciary,      105th Cong. 2d Sess., H. Rep. 105-830 (December 15, 1998) at      118 [hereafter Clinton Report].---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Perjury is a statutory crime, set forth in the U.S. Code at      18 U.S.C. Sec. 1621, Sec. 1623. It requires proof that an      individual has, while under the oath of an official      proceeding, knowingly made a false statement about facts      material to the proceeding. As seasoned federal prosecutors      testified before the House Judiciary Committee, perjury is a      specific intent crime requiring proof of the defendant's      state of mind, i.e., the charge cannot be based solely upon      unresponsive, misleading, or evasive answers.\41\ Both the      House Managers and Counsel for the President have referred to      the statutes referenced above and agree on the elements      necessary to convict on a charge of perjury.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \41\ The Record, supra note 27, Volume X at 284 (Statement of      Thomas P. Sullivan, Former U.S. Attorney, Northern District      of Illinois).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       I find it hard to accept the proposition by the President's      Counsel that Mr. Clinton ``testified truthfully before the      Grand Jury.'' \42\ Rather than truthful, his testimony      appears to be motivated by a desire not to commit perjury,      i.e., making intentionally false statements about material      facts. This dance with the law is not what one expects of a      President. However, it is important to realize that in      beginning his Grand Jury testimony, the President read a      statement in which he admitted being ``alone'' with Ms.      Lewinsky and engaging in ``inappropriate intimate'' \43\      contact with her. Thus, unlike the testimony he provided in      the Jones civil deposition, the President admitted an      improper, consensual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. It is      against this backdrop that the House Mangers allege perjury.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \42\ Trial Memorandum of President William Jefferson Clinton,      In Re Impeachment of President William Jefferson Clinton,      [hereinafter PCTB] (Submitted January 13, 1999, pursuant to      S. Res. 16) at 38.     \43\ The full text of the President's statement before the      Grand Jury can be found in The Record, supra note 27, Volume      III, Part 1 of 2, at 460-62; See also PCTB, supra note 42, at      39; See also HMTB, supra note 38, at 52-60.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       The Managers allege in H. Res. 611, which reported the      Articles of Impeachment to the Senate, that the President      ``willfully provided perjurious . . . testimony . . .      concerning one or  more of the following: (1) the nature and      details of his relationship with'' Ms. Lewinsky; (2)      ``prior perjurious . . . testimony'' given in the Jones      deposition; (3) ``prior false and misleading statements he      allowed his attorney to make'' in the Jones deposition;      and (4) ``his corrupt efforts to influence the testimony      of witnesses and to impede the discovery of evidence'' in      Jones. The facts refute some of these charges, while legal      analysis, precedent and common sense preclude pursuit of      the others.     1. The Nature and Details of the Clinton/Lewinsky          Relationship       With regard to the first charge of perjury, the Managers      fail to cite specific perjurious language in the Article;      however, their Trial Brief provides several allegations. It      asserts that the President's denial that he touched Ms.      Lewinsky in certain areas with a specific intent is      ``patently false.'' \44\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \44\ HMTB, supra note 38, at 53.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       The most troubling evidence that the President lied in this      instance is Ms. Lewinsky's testimony to the contrary. While      Ms. Lewinsky has more credibility than the President      concerning the intimacies of their relationship, experienced      prosecutors, appointed by both Democrats and Republicans,      have testified that conflicting testimony of this type would      not be prosecuted for two reasons. First, ``he said, she      said'' discrepancies regarding perjury are difficult to prove      beyond a reasonable doubt without third party      corroboration.\45\ This is particularly true in this case,      where first Independent Counsel Starr and now the House      Managers choose to believe Ms. Lewinsky when she helps their      case, but impugn her testimony when she refutes their      accusations. Second, testimony concerning sex in a civil      proceeding would not normally warrant criminal      prosecution.\46\ Indeed, in her Senate deposition, Ms.      Lewinsky was unwilling to portray the President's testimony      as untruthful.\47\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \45\ The Trial Brief of the House Managers states that the      President's testimony is ``directly contradicted by the      corroborated testimony of Monica Lewinsky.'' Id. By      ``corroborated'' the Managers refer to the fact that the      Office of Independent Counsel (OIC) was extremely thorough in      questioning all of Ms. Lewinsky's friends and associates to      whom she described the intimate details of her contact with      the President. Legally, the fact that Ms. Lewinsky relayed      her recollection of the facts to various third parties does      not provide additional, independent evidence of the nature of      her contact with the President.     \46\ The Record, supra note 27, Volume X at 284 (Statement of      Thomas P. Sullivan, Former U.S. Attorney, Northern District      of Illinois); see also Id. at 325, 332, 333 (testimony of      Ronald K. Noble and William F. Weld).     \47\ During her Senate deposition, Manager Bryant asked Ms.      Lewinsky if, contrary to his defense, the President's contact      with her fit into that described in the Jones deposition. In      response Ms. Lewinsky said, ``I'm not trying to be difficult,      but there is a portion of . . . [the] definition [used in the      Jones deposition] that says, you know, with intent, and I      don't feel comfortable characterizing what someone else's      intent was. I can tell you that I--my memory of this      relationship and what I remember happened fell within that      definition . . . but I'm just not comfortable commenting on      someone else's intent or state of mind or what they      thought.'' 145 Cong. Rec. S1221 (daily ed. Feb. 4, 1999)      (Senate deposition of Ms. Lewinsky).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       In further support of the perjury allegation regarding the      ``nature and details'' of the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship,      the Managers also alleged that the President's Grand Jury      testimony concerning his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky was      perjurious because (1) his recollection of when the      approximately two-year affair began differs from Ms.      Lewinsky's by a few months; (2) he admitted to occasionally      having inappropriate banter on the phone with Ms. Lewinsky      when     it occurred as many as seventeen times; and (3) he described      his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky as beginning as a      ``friendship.'' \48\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \48\ See HMTB, supra note 38, at 57; see also Clinton Report,      supra note 40 at 34.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Disregarding the futility of attempting to judge the      veracity of these statements, they appear to be totally      immaterial to the Grand Jury given that the President      admitted an affair with Ms. Lewinsky. Indeed, the triviality      of these charges are indicative of the inability of the House      Managers to utilize any sense of proportionality in      adjudicating the unacceptable behavior of the President. This      weakness is magnified by the fact that the House Managers      have asserted that conviction on any one of their allegations      of perjury warrant conviction.\49\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \49\ H. Res. 611.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       It is difficult to believe that anyone would charge an      individual with perjury, never mind advocate the removal of a      popularly-elected President, based upon an interpretation of      the words ``occasionally'' or ``friendship.'' It is      staggering that the Managers, after forcing Ms. Lewinsky to      testify under oath during this trial, would press her on the      details and timing of her first intimate contacts with the      President in order to ``prove'' the relationship did not      begin as a ``friendship.'' \50\ As demonstrated by the      frustration of the American people with this line of inquiry,      the resources, both human and financial, expended by the      Managers were not warranted by the substance of the charge.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \50\ 145 Cong. Rec. S1213 (daily ed. Feb. 4, 1999)      (Transcript of Lewinsky Deposition in which Mr. Manager      Bryant is questioning Ms. Lewinsky about the timing and      intimate details of her relationship).---------------------------------------------------------------------------     2. Perjury Concerning the President's Deposition Testimony in          Jones       The Managers' second charge of perjury is that before the      Grand Jury the President repeated false testimony he gave in      the Jones deposition. This argument appears an attempt to      convict the President for lies he told in his Jones      deposition, an Article which the full House of      Representatives rejected. Ultimately, this subsection of      Article I collapses on itself.       In their Trial Brief the Managers also assert that the      President reaffirmed or adopted his entire deposition      testimony before the Grand Jury. This is simply not true. To      make this assertion the Managers use the President's Grand      Jury testimony that ``I was determined to walk through the      mine field of this deposition without violating the law, and      I believe I did.'' \51\ Before the Grand Jury the President      refuted his deposition testimony that he was never alone with      Ms. Lewinsky.\52\ In addition to being inaccurate, these      charges were rejected by the full House. Not even Independent      Prosecutor Starr alleged that the President committed perjury      concerning this issue.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \51\ HMTB, supra note 38, at 60.     \52\ In his opening statement before the Grand Jury the      President began, ``When I was alone with Ms. Lewinsky. . .      .'' The Independent Counsel followed-up and asked if he was      alone with Ms. Lewinsky. The President answered, ``yes.'' The      Record, supra note 43 at 460-62, 481.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     3. Perjury With Respect to Mr. Bennett's Offer of the          Lewinsky Affidavit       The third charge asserted by the Managers to substantiate      Article I is that the President lied before the Grand Jury      when he testified that ``I'm not even sure I paid attention      to what he [Mr. Bennett] was saying.'' \53\ The President      made this statement to the Grand Jury after being asked about      Mr. Bennett's representation to the Jones court that Ms.      Lewinsky's deposition verified that there was ``no sex of any      kind in any manner'' between her and the President.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \53\ HMTB, supra note 38, at 62.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       On page 62 of their Trial Brief the Managers assert that      this testimony is perjurious because ``it defied common      sense'' and the fact that the video of the deposition ``shows      the President looking directly at Mr. Bennett.'' This      evidence fails to provide any insight on the President's      state of mind and thus cannot meet the standard of proof that      the President knowingly made a false statement.     4. Perjury in Denying the Obstruction of Justice Charges       Finally, in subpart four of Article I, the Managers allege      that the President lied when he denied both tampering with      witnesses and impeding discovery in the Jones case. This      allegation bootstraps every allegation made in Article II      into an additional charge of perjury.       First, the Managers charge that the President lied when he      told the Grand Jury that he instructed Ms. Lewinsky that if      gifts were subpoenaed they would have to be turned over. I      will address Article II's charge of obstruction later. With      regard to the charge that he committed perjury, Ms. Lewinsky      provided testimony in her Senate deposition which requires      rejection of the allegation. Ms. Lewinsky has testified that      when she asked the President if she should give the      subpoenaed gifts to someone, ``maybe Betty,'' the President      either failed to reply or said ``I don't know,'' or ``let me      think about that.'' \54\ However, after the President's Grand      Jury testimony, Ms. Lewinsky was pressed on the issue. When a      FBI agent asked if she recalled the President telling her      that she must turn over gifts in her possession should they      be subpoenaed by the Jones attorneys, Ms. Lewinsky said,      ``You know, that sounds a little bit familiar to me.'' \55\      On its face, Ms. Lewinsky's testimony would seem to make it      more likely than not that the President told her to turn over      whatever gifts she had.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \54\ HMTB, supra note 38, at 64 (quoting Grand Jury testimony      of Ms. Lewinsky).     \55\ 145 Cong. Rec. S1228 (daily ed. February 6, 1999)(Senate      Deposition Testimony of Ms. Lewinsky).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       There are two remaining allegations in the final subpart of      Article I. First, it is alleged that the President committed      perjury when he told the Grand Jury that on January 18, 1998,      he made statements to Ms. Currie to ``refresh his memory.''      Second, the Managers allege that he lied when he testified to      the Grand Jury that facts he relayed to his aides in denying      an affair were ``true'' but ``misleading.''       I am troubled by the inability of the President to be      completely forthright concerning both his relationship with      Ms. Lewinsky and subsequent attempts to conceal this affair      from his family, friends, staff, constituents, and Ms. Jones.      In no way do I condone this behavior. However, seasoned      federal prosecutors have made it known that the statements of      this type, made by the President or an average citizen, would      not, indeed should not, be prosecuted as perjury. The power      and prestige of the federal government should not be brought      to bear on a citizen regarding testimony in a civil case      pertaining to an improper sexual affair. The Impeachment      Trial has borne this out. Discrepancies in testimony between      two individuals, and only those two, seldom satisfy the      standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt (or by      preponderance of the evidence, for that matter.) Moreover,      citizens are uncomfortable with such a role for government.       The Managers have alleged that a failure to convict the      President on perjury grounds will destroy civil rights      jurisprudence and allow any future President to lie with      impunity. Both the Managers and our government weathered      untruths during both the Iran-Contra investigation and the      ethics investigation of former Speaker Gingrich. Citizens may      well lack confidence in the ability of President Clinton to      be honest about his personal life, this is not, however, a      threat to our government. The President, as a citizen,      remains subject to both criminal and civil sanctions. The      Managers have failed to meet the burden of proof they set      regarding the perjury charges brought against President      William Jefferson Clinton.               VII. OBSTRUCTION ALLEGATIONS OF ARTICLE II       Article II alleges that the President obstructed justice by      engaging ``personally, and through his subordinates and      agents, in a course of conduct or scheme designed to delay,      impede, cover up and conceal the existence of evidence and      testimony related to a Federal civil rights action brought      against him in a duly instituted judicial proceeding.'' \56\      The focal point of these allegations is the Jones litigation.      Article II outlines seven specific ``acts'' that the      President used to implement this ``course of conduct or      scheme.'' These ``acts'' will be analyzed to determine if      they established a foundation for a finding of ``high Crimes      and Misdemeanors.''---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \56\ H. Res. 611.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       As an initial point, it is necessary to set out the      elements of the crime of obstruction of justice, as set forth      at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1503. The components of the offense      include: (1) there existed a pending judicial proceeding; (2)      the accused knew of the proceeding; and (3) the defendant      acted ``corruptly'' with the specific intent to obstruct and      interfere with the proceeding or due administration of      justice.\57\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \57\ 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1503. The House Managers periodically      urge that the President is guilty of witness tampering. The      crime of witness tampering is set forth at 18 U.S.C.      Sec. 1512. This statute requires proof that a defendant      knowingly engaged in intimidation, physical force, threats,      misleading conduct, or corrupt persuasion with the specific      intent to influence, delay, or prevent testimony or cause any      person to withhold objects or documents from an official      proceeding. Like the obstruction of justice charge, witness      tampering requires proof of a specific intent to interfere      with a witness.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       The critical question in regard to the allegations is      whether the President acted with the specific intent to      interfere with the administration of justice. Absent a      demonstrable ``act'' coupled with a demonstrable ``specific      intent,'' no crime occurs. The House Managers point to the      seven following acts as the basis of their claim.     1. The Lewinsky Affidavit       The Article alleges that ``[o]n or about December 17, 1997,      William Jefferson Clinton corruptly encouraged a witness in a      Federal civil rights action brought against him to execute a      sworn affidavit in that proceeding that he knew to be      perjurious, false and misleading.'' \58\ The allegations go      to the Affidavit prepared by Monica Lewinsky in conjunction      with the Jones litigation.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \58\ H. Res. 611.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       The best evidence of the President's involvement in this      affidavit is the testimony of Monica Lewinsky. Ms. Lewinsky      has repeatedly and consistently stated that no one asked her      or instructed her to lie.       ``[N]o one ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a      job for my silence.'' \59\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \59\ The Record, supra note 27, Volume III, Part 1 at 1161      (Lewinsky Grand Jury testimony 8/20/98).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       ``Neither the Pres[ident] nor Mr. Jordan (or anyone on      their behalf) asked or encouraged Ms. L[ewinsky] to lie.''      \60\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \60\ Id. at 718 (handwritten proffer of Lewinsky, given to      OIC 2/1/98).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       ``Neither the President or JORDAN ever told LEWINSKY that      she had to lie.'' \61\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \61\ Id. at 1398 (FBI Interview with Lewinsky 7/27/98).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       ``Neither the President nor anyone ever directed LEWINSKY      to say anything or to lie . . .'' \62\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \62\ Id. at 1400.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Despite these repeated denials, the House Managers persist      in arguing that the President influenced Ms. Lewinsky to file      a false affidavit in a early morning phone call on December      17, 1997. They hang their case on a portion of the      conversation that involved a discussion of the filing of an      affidavit in response to a subpoena from the Jones lawyers      and another portion of the conversation that dealt with the      ``cover story'' that both the President and Ms. Lewinsky had      been using to disguise their affair. Ms. Lewinsky has      testified that, in a call on December 17, 1997, the President      said ``Well, maybe you can sign an affidavit.'' \63\ The      House Managers argue that this statement alone must convict      because both the President and Ms. Lewinsky knew that a      truthful affidavit could never be filed given the clandestine      nature of their relationship.\64\ This theory disregards the      testimony of both the President and Ms. Lewinsky.\65\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \63\ Id. (Grand Jury Testimony of Ms. Lewinsky on 8/6/98)      (quoted in HMTB, supra note 38, at 22.)     \64\ ``Both parties knew that the Affidavit would need to be      false and misleading to accomplish the desired result.''      HMTB, supra note 38, at 22.     \65\ The President testified that ``I've already told you      that I felt strongly that she could issue, that she could      execute an affidavit that would be factually truthful, that      might get her out of having to testify. . . . And did I hope      she'd be able to get out of testifying on an affidavit?      Absolutely. Did I want her to execute a false affidavit? No,      I did not.'' The Record, supra note 27, Volume X at 571.     Ms. Lewinsky testified to the Grand Jury on 8/6/98, that ``I      thought that signing an affidavit could range from anywhere--     the point of it would be to deter or to prevent me from being      deposed and so that that could range from anywhere between      maybe just somehow mentioning, you know, innocuous things or      going as far as maybe having to deny any kind of      relationship.'' Id. at 844. In her Senate Deposition Mr.      Manager Bryant asked Ms. Lewinsky, ``The night of the phone      call, he's [the President is] suggesting you could file an      affidavit. Did you appreciate the implications of filing a      false affidavit with the court?'' Ms. Lewinsky replied, ``I      don't think I necessarily thought at that point it would have      to be false, so, no, probably not.'' 145 Cong. Rec. at S1218      (daily ed. February 4, 1999).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Any lingering doubt about the nature of the telephone      conversation on December 17, 1997, was erased by the      videotaped testimony of Ms. Lewinsky before the Senate. The      House Managers repeatedly argued that the President not only      influenced the content of her affidavit, but that the      President was knowledgeable of those contents. In a response      to Mr. Manager Bryant's question, however, Ms. Lewinsky      unequivocally stated that ``[h]e didn't discuss the content      of my affidavit with me at all, ever.'' \66\ The House      Mangers argued that the telephone call on December 17, 1997,      was a deliberate attempt by the President to compel Ms.      Lewinsky to submit an affidavit that would explicitly      encompass their pre-existing cover story. Again, in response      to Mr. Manager Bryant's questions, Ms. Lewinsky stated:---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \66\ 145 Cong. Rec. at S1307 (daily ed. February 6, 1999).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       ``Q: Now, you have testified in the Grand Jury. I think      your closing comments was that no one ever asked you to lie,      but yet in that very conversation of December 17th, 1997,      when the President told you that you were on the witness      list, he also suggested that you could sign an affidavit and      use misleading cover stories. Isn't that correct?       ``A: Uh--well, I--I guess in my mind, I separated      necessarily signing affidavit and using misleading cover      stories. So, does----       ``Q: Well, those two----       ``A: Those three events occurred, but they don't--they      weren't linked for me.'' \67\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \67\ Id. at. S1306.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       The House Managers argued that Ms. Lewinsky could have only      filed the affidavit as a result of pressure from the      President. They reasoned that only the President could      benefit from Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit. Ms. Lewinsky totally      refuted their view. Again, in another exchange with Mr.      Manager Bryant, Ms. Lewinsky stated:       ``Q: But you didn't file the affidavit for your best      interest, did you?       ``A: Uh, actually, I did.       ``Q: To avoid testifying.       ``A: Yes.       ``Q: Why--why didn't you want to testify? Why would not      you--why would you have wanted to avoid testifying?       ``A: First of all, I thought it was nobody's business.      Second of all, I didn't want to have anything to do with      Paula Jones or her case. And--I guess those two reasons.''      \68\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \68\ Id.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       After Ms. Lewinsky's videotaped testimony, it is clear that      she filed the affidavit of her own volition to satisfy her      own needs. The President did not influence the content of the      affidavit. His remark in the December 17, 1997, conversation      was, at the most, a terse response to her request rather than      a elaborate directive to Ms. Lewinsky. There is no credible      evidence that the President orchestrated an attempt to file a      false affidavit.     2. The Lewinsky Testimony       The House Managers assert that during that same early      morning telephone conversation on December 17, 1997, the      President ``corruptly'' encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to give      ``perjurious, false and misleading testimony if and when      called to testify personally in that proceeding.'' \69\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \69\ H. Res. 611.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Once again, this allegation completely fails to consider      the sworn testimony of Ms. Lewinsky that ``no one ever asked      me to lie and I was never promised a job for my silence.''      \70\ Moreover, Ms. Lewinsky's videotaped testimony before the      Senate provides even more detail to her previous statements.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \70\ The Record, supra note 27, Volume X at 1161 (quoting Ms.      Lewinky's Grand  Jury  testimony  on 8/20/98). See also PCTB,      supra note 42, at 56-57.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       The House Managers suggest that the ``cover story''      developed by Ms. Lewinsky and the President to disguise their      relationship was explicitly urged upon Ms. Lewinsky by the      President in response to the subpoena. There is little      evidence to support this view. Indeed, the available evidence      undermines the position of the House Managers. The following      Grand Jury testimony of Ms. Lewinsky indicates that there was      no explicit linkage between their ongoing denials of      a relationship and the Jones litigation.       ``Q [JUROR]: It is possible that you also had these      discussions [about denying the relationship] after you      learned that you were a witness in the Paula Jones case?       ``A: I don't believe so. No.       ``Q: Can you exclude that possibility?       ``A: I pretty much can. I really don't remember it. I mean,      it would be very surprising for me to be confronted with      something that would show me different but I--it was 2:30 in      the--I mean, the conversation I'm thinking of mainly would      have been December 17th, which was----       ``Q: The telephone call.       ``A: Right. And it was--you know, 2:00, 2:30 in the      morning. I remember the gist of it and I--I really don't      think so.       ``Q: Thank you.'' \71\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \71\ The Record, supra note 27, Volume X at 1119-90 (quoting      Ms. Lewinsky's Grand Jury testimony on 8/20/98).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       The House Managers have presented no credible evidence to      overcome the sworn testimony of the parties.     3. Concealment of Gifts       The Articles alleges that ``[o]n or about December 28,      1997, William Jefferson Clinton corruptly engaged in,      encouraged, or supported a scheme to conceal evidence that      had been subpoenaed in a Federal civil rights action brought      against him.'' The allegation refers to the transfer of gifts      from Ms. Lewinsky to Betty Currie on December 28, 1997.       The House Managers argue that the President directed Ms.      Currie to contact Ms. Lewinsky and arrange for the collection      of personal gifts that he gave Ms. Lewinsky and for their      subsequent concealment in Ms. Currie's home. There is      conflicting evidence whether Ms. Currie or Ms. Lewinsky      arranged for the pick-up of gifts. Regardless of who      initiated the gift transfer, however, there is insufficient      evidence that the President was involved in the transfer.       The chain of events leading to the transfer of gifts began      with a meeting between the President and Ms. Lewinsky on      December 28, 1997. Ms. Lewinsky indicated in one of her Grand      Jury appearances that in the course of the meeting she raised      the topic of the numerous personal gifts that the President      had given her in light of the Jones subpoena. According to      her Grand Jury testimony, Ms. Lewinsky recalled: ``[A]t some      point I said to him, `Well, you know, should I--maybe I      should put the gifts away outside my house somewhere or give      them to someone, maybe Betty.' And he sort of said--I think      he responded, `I don't know' or `Let me think about that.'      And left that topic.'' \72\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \72\ Id. Volume III, Part 1 at 872 (Lewinsky Grand Jury      testimony 8/6/98). Ms. Lewinsky discussed this exchange with      the President at least ten different times during her      multiple interviews and appearances as a witness. In a      subsequent appearance before the Grand Jury on August 20,      1998, she again recalled this discussion and stated ``And      he--I don't remember his response. I think it was something      like, ``I don't know, or `Hmm,' or--there really was no      response.'' Id. at 1122 (emphasis added). It is clear from      her testimony that there was no discussion of the concealment      of gifts with the President.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       The next link in the chain is the most confusing. There is      no question that Betty Currie picked up a box of gifts from      Monica Lewinsky on the afternoon of December 28, 1997.      However, there is still an unresolved dispute concerning who      initiated this activity. Both Ms. Currie and the President      denied ever having any conversation in which the President      instructed Ms. Currie to retrieve the gifts from Ms.      Lewinsky. Ms. Currie has repeatedly testified that it was Ms.      Lewinsky who contacted her about the gifts. On the other      hand, Ms. Lewinsky testified that Ms. Currie called her to      initiate the transfer.       The Managers and the Committee Report cited the following      passage from Ms. Lewinsky's Grand Jury testimony.       ``Q: What did [Betty Currie] say?       ``A: She said, ``I understand you have something to give      me.'' Or, ``The President said you have something to give      me.'' Along those lines. . . .       ``Q: When she said something along the lines of ``I      understand you have something to give me,'' or, ``The      President says you have something for me,'' what did you      understand her to mean?       ``A: The gifts.\73\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \73\ Clinton Report, supra note 40 at 67-68 (quoting The      Record, supra note 27, Volume III at 874-75 (Lewinsky Grand      Jury testimony 8/6/98); see also HMTB, supra note 38, at 32-     33. However, Ms. Lewinsky's recollection of references to the      President in this conversation were later cast in doubt by      her subsequent testimony. In her Grand Jury testimony, Ms.      Lewinsky was quoted as:     Q: [Juror]: Do you remember Betty Currie saying that the      President had told her to call?     A: Right now, I don't. I don't remember. . . .     The Record, supra note 27, Volume III at 1141 (Lewinsky Grand      Jury testimony 8/20/98).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       The uncontradicted evidence is that the President and Ms.      Currie did not discuss the gifts. The uncontradicted evidence      is that the President did not initiate the discussion of      gifts with Ms. Lewinsky and made no substantive response to      her discussion of the gifts. The unresolved issue is whether      Ms. Lewinsky or Ms. Currie initiated the transfer of gifts.      Ms. Lewinsky's videotaped testimony before the Senate does      not resolve the issue of who initiated the gift transfer. it      does, however, add critical details that suggest that Ms.      Lewinsky, of her own volition, decided to surrender certain      ``innocuous'' items to the Jones lawyers, while concealing      other gifts. First, Ms. Lewinsky had already decided before      the meeting with the President, on December 28, 1997, to      conceal items from the Jones layers. As she told House      Manager Bryant in Senate deposition testimony: on December      22, 1997, six days before her meeting with the President, she      bought the gifts that she was willing to surrender to a      meeting with Vernon Jordan.       ``Q: Did, uh, you bring with you to the meeting with Mr.      Jordan, and for the purpose of carrying it, I guess, to Mr.      Carter, items in response to this request for production?       ``A: Yes.       ``Q: Did you discuss these items with Mr. Jordan?       ``A: I think I showed them to him. . . .       ``Q: Okay. How did you select those items?       ``A: Uh, actually, kind of in an obnoxious way, I guess . .      . they were innocuous. . . .       ``Q: In other words, it wouldn't give away any kind of      special relationship?       ``A: Exactly.       ``Q: And was that your intent?       ``A: Yes.       ``Q: Did you discuss how you selected those items with      anybody?       ``A: No.\74\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \74\ 145 Cong. Rec. S1222 (daily ed. February 4, 1999)      (deposition of Ms. Lewinsky).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Not only did Ms. Lewinsky decide unilaterally to withhold      certain gifts, she also decided unilaterally to conceal these      gifts, not at the behest of the President, but out of her own      concern for privacy. In response to a question posed by Mr.      Manager Bryant, Ms. Lewinsky stated, ``I was worried someone      might break into my house or concerned that they actually      existed, but I wasn't concerned about turning them over      because I knew I wasn't going to, for the reason you      stated.'' \75\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \75\ 145 Cong. Rec. S1309 (daily ed. February 6, 1999)      (deposition of Ms. Lewinsky as replayed during the trial).      Manager Bryant's question is compound and slightly confusing,      Ms. Lewinsky's response, combined with her testimony that she      avoided testifying for reasons in her own best interest,      makes clear that she had come to an independent conclusion      not to provide gifts to the Jones attorneys.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       The final detail added by Ms. Lewinsky's videotaped      testimony may be the most significant. The President      testified to the Grand Jury that Ms. Lewinsky raised the      issue of gifts he responded: ``You have to give them whatever      you have.'' \76\ When questioned by an FBI agent after the      President's testimony, Ms. Lewinsky said that the words in      the President's testimony, ``sounds [sic[ a little bit      familiar to me.'' \77\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \76\ This statement has been dismissed by the House Managers      as self-serving at best. However, Ms. Lewinsky's Senate      Deposition testimony lends significant collaboration to the      President's claim. See supra, note 55, p. 23.     \77\ Id.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     4. The Lewinsky Job Search       The Article alleges that ``[b]eginning on or about December      7, 1997, and continuing through and including January 14,      1998, William Jefferson Clinton intensified and succeeded in      an effort to secure job assistance to a witness in a Federal      civil rights action against him in order to corruptly prevent      the truthful testimony of that witness in that proceeding at      a time when the truthful testimony of that witness would have      been harmful to him.'' \78\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \78\ H. Res. 611.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       This allegation focuses on the efforts to find employment      for Ms. Lewinsky. Of critical importance is the undisputed      fact that these efforts began long before Ms. Lewinsky was      identified as a potential witness in the Jones case. Ms.      Lewinsky herself initiated the search for employment based on      her dissatisfaction with her job at the Pentagon and her      perception that she would not be able to return to work in      the White House. Ms. Lewinsky suggested that Vernon Jordan be      enlisted to aid her, and his involvement was obtained at Ms.      Lewinsky's request by Mr. Jordan's long-time friend Betty      Currie.\79\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \79\ In one of the more unusual aspects of this case, it      appears that the idea to enlist Mr. Jordan's assistance came      from Linda Tripp's ``advice'' to Ms. Lewinsky. See PCTB,      supra note 42, note 103, at 78.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       The allegation of the House Managers crashes on the same      unshakable and uncontradicted statement that has bedeviled      them from the start. Monica Lewinsky's unchallenged statement      is that ``no one ever asked me to lie and I was never      promised a job for my silence.'' \80\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \80\ Supra, note 70 at 29.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Unable to refute her statement, the House Managers      attempted to weave a pattern of circumstantial evidence. Each      attempt of the House Managers rapidly unraveled.       Mr. Manager Hutchinson argued with great force and skill in      his opening presentation that December 11, 1997, was the      critical date in the case against the President. It was on      that date that Judge Wright ordered the President to answer      certain questions about ``other women.'' As Mr. Manager      Hutchinson argued on the Floor: ``And so, what triggered--     let's look at the chain of events. The judge--the witness      list came in, the judge's order came in, that triggered the      President into action and the President triggered Vernon      Jordan into action. That chain reaction here is what moved      the job search along . . . . Remember what else happened on      the day [December 11] again. That was the same day that Judge      Wright ruled that the questions about other relationships      could be asked by the Jones attorneys.\81\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \81\ 145 Cong. Rec. S234 (daily ed Jan. 14, 1999)      (presentation of Manager Hutchinson).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       The thrust of the House Managers' argument is that the      President learned that Ms. Lewinsky was on the witness list      on December 6, 1997. He met with Mr. Jordan on December 7,      1997, to enlist Mr. Jordan in the Lewinsky job search, and,      with the Judge's order on December 11, 1997, making Ms.      Lewinsky's testimony more likely, Mr. Jordan ``intensified''      what had been a dormant record of assistance. This scenario      is demonstrably false.       The House Judiciary Committee Report acknowledges that the      meeting between the President and Mr. Jordan on December 7,      1997, had nothing to do with Ms. Lewinsky.\82\ Because of      this lack of interest by the President and Mr. Jordan in Ms.      Lewinsky's job search, the House Managers had to seize an      event that could plausibly trigger the ``intensification'' of      the job search which allegedly occurred on December 11, 1997.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \82\ Clinton Report, supra note 40, at 11. This fact alone      casts serious doubt on the theory of the House Managers. If      Ms. Lewinsky's appearance on the witness list was disturbing      to the President, and he was participating in the job search      to silence Ms. Lewinsky, why would he avoid discussing this      matter with Mr. Jordan?---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Although December 11, 1997, was the date of a meeting      between Mr. Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky, the record shows that      this meeting was arranged prior to that date without the      participation of the President. As early Thanksgiving, Mr.      Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky had a conversation in which Mr.      Jordan told her that ``he was working on her job search'' and      asked her to contact him again'' around the first week of      December.'' \83\ In response to a request from Ms. Lewinsky,      Betty Currie called Vernon Jordan on December 5, 1997, to      request a meeting. (This was one day before the President      became aware of the appearance of Ms. Lewinsky's name on the      witness list.) Mr. Jordan told Ms. Currie to have Ms.      Lewinsky call him to arrange a meeting. Ms. Lewinsky did so      on December 8, 1997, confirming a meeting with Mr. Jordan on      December 11, 1997.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \83\ The Record, supra note 27, Volume III at 1465 (Lewinsky      OIC interview 7/31/98).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Since the appearance of Ms. Lewinsky on the witness list      did not prompt any accelerated action on the job search and      since the meeting of Ms. Lewinsky and Mr. Jordan was      contemplated and initiated before the release of the witness      list, the House Managers were forced to grasp for some other      triggering event. Unwisely, as clearly stated in Mr. Manager      Hutchinson's remarks, they chose the issuance of Judge      Wright's order.       Judge Wright initiated a conference call with lawyers in      the Jones case at 6:33 pm (EST) on December 11, 1997. At 7:50      pm (EST), she concluded the conference by informing the      parties that she would issue an ``order to compel'' testimony      about ``other women.'' At that moment, Vernon Jordan was      somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean on United flight 946      bound for Amsterdam. His meeting with Ms. Lewinsky had      concluded hours before. Obviously, the meeting with Ms.      Lewinsky, the calls on her behalf, the ``intensification''      of the job search, had nothing to do with Judge Wright's      order.       Nothing so illustrates the fragility of the House Managers'      case as this dubious and discredited attempt to characterize      Judge Wright's order as a catalyst for an illegal job search.      Forced to beat a hasty retreat by the revelation of this      attempted legal slight of hand, the House Managers reversed      course and argued, unconvincingly, that they always saw the      triggering event as the release of the witness list on      December 5, 1997, or the President's receipt of the list on      December 6, 1997.\84\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \84\ It is interesting to note that the Article alleges that      the incriminating events began on December 7, 1997, and      continued thereafter until January 14, 1998. Once again,      these constantly shifting dates illustrate the ad hoc nature      of this argument.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       This assertion, however, contradicts the evidence that      there was no discussion about Ms. Lewinsky during the meeting      between the President and Mr. Jordan on December 7, 1997, and      the evidence that the December 11, 1997, meeting was arranged      by Ms. Lewinsky and Mr. Jordan without knowledge of the      witness list or Judge Wright's order and without the      assistance of the President.       Ms. Lewinsky received the active assistance of Mr. Jordan      to obtain interviews and favorable recommendations with three      prominent New York firms. She succeeded in obtaining a job at      one of these firms, Revlon. According to representatives of      these firms, they felt no pressure to hire Ms. Lewinsky.\85\     (Behavior that undercuts the suggestions of the House      Managers that Mr. Jordan was engaged in a high stakes effort      to find Ms. Lewinsky a job at all costs.)---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \85\ The FBI investigators working for Mr. Starr recorded the      following testimony of representatives of Revlon, American      Express and Young and Rubicam: ``On December 11, 1997,      HALPERIN received a telephone call from VERNON JORDAN [who      recommended Ms. Lewinsky]. . . . There was no implied time      constraint for fast action. HALPERIN did not think there was      anything unusual about Jordan's request.'' The Record, supra      note 27, Volume IV, Part 1 at 1286 (FBI Interview with      Richard Halperin, Executive VP and Special Counsel, Mac      Andrews & Forbes (holding company for Revlon) 3/27/98);      ``Fairbairn said . . . there was no perceived pressure      exerted by JORDAN.'' Id. at 1087 (FBI Interview with Ursula      Fairbairn, Executive Vice President, Human Resources and      Quality, American Express, 2/4/98). ``JORDAN did not engage      in a `sales pitch' about LEWINSKY.'' Id. at 1222 (FBI      Interview with Peter Georgescu, CEO of Young and Rubicam, 3/     25/98).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Mr. Jordan emphatically denied that he acted to silence Ms.      Lewinsky. ``Unequivocally, indubitably, no.'' \86\ The      President denied that he attempted to buy her silence. ``I      was not trying to buy her silence or get Vernon Jordan to buy      her silence.'' \87\ But, Ms. Lewinsky said it best: ``I was      never promised a job for my silence.'' \88\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \86\ The Record, supra note 27, Volume IV, Part 2 at 1827      (Jordan Grand Jury testimony on 5/5/98).     \87\ Id., Volume III, part 1 at 576 (Clinton Grand Jury      testimony on 8/17/98).     \88\ Id. at 1161 (Lewinsky Grand Jury testimony 8/20/98).---------------------------------------------------------------------------     5. Allowing False Statements by his Attorneys       The Article alleges that the President ``corruptly allowed      his attorney to make false and misleading statements to a      Federal judge characterizing an affidavit . . .'' \89\ This      allegation rests on the President's silence during the Jones      deposition while his attorney, Mr. Robert Bennett, cited the      Lewinsky affidavit to Judge Wright as a representation that      ``there is no sex of any kind in any manner, shape or form.''      \90\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \89\ H. Res. 611.     \90\ Clinton Report, supra note 40, at 72.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       There is no doubt about the President's silence. There is,      however, doubt about the President's state of mind; whether      he was aware of the interchange between his counsel and Judge      Wright; and whether he formed the specific intent to use his      silence to allow a falsehood to be advanced.       The President consistently denied his awareness of this      exchange and testified that he was concentrating on his      testimony:       ``I'm not even sure I paid much attention to what he was      saying. I was thinking, I was ready to get on with my      testimony here and they were having these constant      discussions all through the deposition. . . .''                           *   *   *   *   *       ``I was not paying a great deal of attention to this      exchange. I was focusing on my own testimony. . . .''                           *   *   *   *   *       ``I'm quite sure that I didn't follow all the interchanges      between the lawyers all that carefully. . . .''                           *   *   *   *   *       ``I am not even sure that when Mr. Bennett made that      statement that I was concentrating on the exact words he      used. . . .''                           *   *   *   *   *       ``When I was there, I didn't think about my lawyers. I was,      frankly, thinking about myself and my testimony and trying to      answer the questions. . . .''                           *   *   *   *   *       ``I didn't pay any attention to this colloquy that went on.      I was waiting for my instructions as a witness to go forward.      I was worried about my own testimony.'' \91\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \91\ The Record, supra note 27, Volume III, Part 1 at 476-513      (Clinton Grand Jury testimony on 8/17/98).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       The President's statements are clearly self-serving. The      only evidence introduced by the House Managers to refute the      President's assertions is an invitation to the Senate to look      at the videotape of the President's deposition in the Jones      case and ``read his mind,'' and an affidavit from Barry W.      Ward, Judge Wright's clerk. Mr. Ward confirms what may be      inferred from the tape. ``From my position at the conference      table, I observed President Clinton looking directly at Mr.      Bennett while this statement was being made.'' \92\ But, Mr.      Ward's ``mind reading'' abilities are probably on a par with      the Senate's. As he indicated in an article in the Legal      Times after the date of his Affidavit, Mr. Ward concluded,      ``I have no idea if he was paying attention. He could have      been thinking about policy initiatives, for all I know.''      \93\ The House Managers have not presented sufficient      evidence to sustain the burden of proof with respect to this      allegation.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \92\ Ward Affidavit.     \93\ Legal Times, February 1, 1999.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     6. The Conversations with Betty Currie       The Article alleges that ``[o]n or about January 18 and      January 20-21, 1998, William Jefferson Clinton related a      false and misleading account of events relevant to a Federal      civil rights action brought against him to a potential      witness in that proceeding. . . .'' \94\ This allegation      embraces two conversations between the President and Betty      Currie, his executive secretary. On January 18, 1998, the day      after his deposition in the Jones case, the President met      with Ms. Currie and asked her a series of leading questions      that he promptly answered himself by declaring ``Right?''      \95\ He had a similar conversation on January 20, 1998.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \94\ H. Res. 611.     \95\ HMTB, supra note 38, at 65.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       The House Managers argue that the President knew that these      rhetorical questions were false and the only purpose for      raising these questions was to influence the testimony of Ms.      Currie.\96\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \96\ Ms. Currie was not a witness in the Jones proceeding at      the time of these conversations. House Managers argue that      the President knew she would be called as a witness because      of his constant references to Ms. Currie in his Jones      deposition. Moreover, Ms. Currie became a witness on January      23, 1998, when the Jones lawyers added her to their witness      list. White House counsels argue that Ms. Currie's addition      to the witness list was not prompted by the President's      testimony, but by information secretly provided to the Jones      lawyers by Linda Tripp. They further add that it cannot be      reasonably assumed that the President was aware that Ms.      Currie was likely to be called as a witness. Obstruction and      witness tampering statutes require knowledge that the      individual is or will be a witness. This argument remains      unresolved, but a lack of resolution injects further      uncertainty as to the allegations.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       What is clear from the evidence is the fact that Ms. Currie      was not influenced by the President' statements. Ms. Currie      testified to that effect to the Grand Jury on July 22, 1998.       ``Q: Now, back again to the four statements that you      testified the President made to you that were presented as      statements, did you feel pressured when he told you those      statements?       ``A: None whatsoever.       ``Q: What did you think, or what was going through your      mind about what he was doing?       ``A: At the time I felt that he was--I want to use the word      shocked or surprised that this was an issue, and he was just      talking.'' \97\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \97\ The Record, supra note 27, Volume III, Part 1 at 668      (Currie Grand Jury testimony on 7/22/98).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Ms. Currie added in her testimony:       ``Q: That was your impression, that he wanted you to say--     because he would end each of the statements with ``Right?'',      with a question.       ``A: I do not remember that he wanted me to say ``Right.''      He would say, ``Right?'' and I could have said, ``Wrong.''       ``Q: But he would end each of those questions with a      ``Right?'' and you could either say whether it was true or      not true.       ``A: Correct.       ``Q: Did you feel any pressure to agree with your boss?       ``A: None.''\98\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \98\ Id.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       What is unclear from the evidence is the President's intent      in making these statements. The President has testified: ``I      do not remember how many times I talked to Betty Currie or      when. I don't. I can't possibly remember that. I do remember,      when I first heard about this story breaking, trying to      ascertain what the facts were, trying to ascertain what      Betty's perception was. I remember that I was highly      agitated, understandably, I think.\99\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \99\ The Record, supra note 27, Volume III, Part 1 at 593      (Clinton Grand Jury testimony on 8/17/98).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       The President's assertion is not without plausibility. He      initiated the conversation after the Jones deposition where      he learned that all of the details of his relationship with      Monica Lewinsky were known by the Jones lawyers and shortly      would be public knowledge. He faced an immediate public and      political disaster. Although he knew what went on, he had to      know what Betty Currie knew, not to influence her testimony      but to determine the potential gaps in this story. Ms. Currie      was the key ``go-between'' with Ms. Lewinsky and her      recollection had to be confirmed. More precisely, the      President had to know if his story would be contradicted by      Ms. Currie.       Given the facts, the President's explanation is as      plausible as that advanced by the House Managers. They have      not established beyond a reasonable doubt that the President      had the specific intent to transform these events into the      crimes of obstruction of justice or witness tampering.     7. The Corruption of Potential Grand Jury Witnesses       The final subpart of the second Article of Impeachment      states that ``[o]n or about January 21, 23, and 26, 1998,      William Jefferson Clinton made false and misleading      statements to potential witnesses in a Federal Grand Jury      proceeding in order to corruptly influence the testimony of      those witness.'' The Managers have alleged that this caused      the Grand Jury to receive ``false and misleading      information.''       In his Referral, Independent Counsel Starr outlines denials      about an affair with Ms. Lewinsky that the President made to      members of his senior staff: John Podesta, Erskine Bowles,      Sidney Blumenthal, and Harold Ickes.\100\ The lies that the      President told ranged from immaterial \101\ to      despicable.\102\ These lies call into question the      President's character and judgment regarding this personal      affair, but they most certainly do not rise to the level of      criminal behavior.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \100\ Referral from Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr to      the House of Representatives, House Doc. 105-310, at 198-203      (September 11, 1998).     \101\ Mr. Podesta testified that the President told him that      after Ms. Lewinsky left the White House (to work at the      Department of Defense), she returned to visit Ms. Currie and      that Ms. Currie was with them at all times. Id. at 88      (quoting Podesta Grand Jury Testimony of 6/16/98).     \102\ In his Senate Deposition Testimony Mr. Blumenthal      testified that he related to the Grand Jury that on 1/21/98      the President told him that Ms. Lewinsky had ``come on to''      him, he [the President] had ``rebuffed'' her, and that Ms.      Lewinsky then ``threatened'' him with telling people that the      two had an affair. See 145 Cong. Rec. S1248 (daily ed.      February 4, 1999).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       In order to constitute obstruction of justice, the      President would have had to specifically intended these      individuals to go before the Grand Jury and lie. It is just      as plausible, if not more plausible, that the President was      simply trying to conceal and deny the affair from the public      at large. The     President spoke to his staff because of the appearance of      press articles; their conversations had nothing whatsoever to      do with the Grand Jury. As the Democratic Minority of the      House Judiciary Committee pointed out: ``does anyone really      think the President would have admitted to this relationship      . . .  if no Grand Jury had been sitting?'' \103\ Independent      Counsel Starr called senior aides to the President before the      Grand Jury because his prosecutors knew that the President,      in furtherance of the public denials he was making, would      have lied to his aides. Under the OIC and House Manager's      theory, by publically denying the affair, the President      tampered with all the grand jurors, who must have known of      his denials. This simply cannot be the case. The President is      dishonorable for lying to his aides and putting them in legal      jeopardy in this way, but he is not a criminal.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \103\ Clinton Report, supra note 40, at 385 (Minority Views).                          ____________________
