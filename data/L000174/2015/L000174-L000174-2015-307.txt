They did that to mark the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday. Many of us are old enough to remember that day when hundreds of brave men and women marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. There, they were savagely beaten because they dared to stand up for their right to vote--a right that we in Vermont take as inalienable. Their blood, their sweat, and their tears helped pave the way for the Voting Rights Act. They ultimately helped move our Nation toward what is supposed to be a ``more perfect Union.''  In commemorating the bravery of these foot soldiers for justice, we are reminded of what we can accomplish if we stand on principle and we come together, Republicans and Democrats, to do what is right. At a time when lawmakers seem far too polarized on the most important issues facing our Nation, I was encouraged to see leaders from both political parties join President Obama and Congressman Lewis, and so many others this weekend in Selma. President George W. Bush shared the stage with President Obama to honor the brave men and women who inspired the Nation and helped bring about historic change.  I was proud to work with President Bush on the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, along with the Republican Chairmen of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, Congressman Sensenbrenner and Senator Specter. We can see them on each side of President Bush in this picture of the bill signing. We can see Congressman Sensenbrenner standing there and the late Senator Specter standing there. I was standing over here with my camera as one of the people who helped move the bill through. President Bush had invited me to attend and I took this photograph at the signing ceremony. I am going to give this photograph to President Bush because it is the only photograph where we can actually see his hand and his signature going down. That is because I was the only person with a camera, standing behind the President. I don't say that to praise my photographic ability; I say that to praise President Bush for signing the bill.  In response to the Supreme Court's Shelby County decision--a decision where five members of the Supreme Court decided they had a far better idea than virtually all House Members and Senators--I have been working with Congressman Sensenbrenner on bipartisan legislation that would restore the Voting Rights Act. This is so that President Obama can sign a bill as President Bush did. Unfortunately, no Republican Senator has yet stepped forward to join me in introducing this legislation in the Senate.  The Republican Party of 2006, along with their President, reached across the aisle to advance the cause of voting rights, saying they were not there for any particular party, they were there for all Americans. I am still hopeful the Republican Senate of 2015 will continue the bipartisan tradition that President Bush and Republican leaders did in 2006.  The civil rights milestones we celebrate this month can't be just historical discussions to be talked about in a history class somewhere. The plain reality is that racial discrimination in voting still exists in this country. Chief Justice Roberts acknowledged that very fact in his opinion in Shelby, and he asked Congress to update the Voting Rights Act. I wish we had not had the Shelby decision--I think it was wrong on many counts--but the majority in the Supreme Court voted that way. I agree with the Chief Justice that it is time for us in the Congress--Republicans and Democrats alike--to act.  In his inspirational speech in Selma on Saturday, President Obama noted that 100 Members of Congress had come to Selma to honor people who died for the right to vote. He then laid out a challenge by saying, ``If we want to honor this day, let that hundred go back to Washington and gather 400 more, and together, pledge to make it their mission to restore the Voting Rights Act this year. That's how we honor those people on this bridge.''  I agree with him. We should come together, as this body has done so many times before, to restore the Voting Rights Act and to reaffirm our steadfast commitment to equal protection under the law.                          ____________________
