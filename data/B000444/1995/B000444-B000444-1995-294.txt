 President, I rise today to voice my strong opposition to efforts by some in the House of Representatives to remove the current moratorium on offshore oil and gas drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf. Last Tuesday, the House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee voted to lift this 14-year-old ban without soliciting any input from the coastal states directly affected. The full committee will have an opportunity to reverse this misguided action this week, and I call on them to reinstate this prohibition.  Mr. President, lifting this moratorium is short-sighted and unnecessary, and threatens to litter our coastline with mammoth drilling rigs. This will only increase the likelihood of oil and gas spills and other environmental disasters.  We faced this battle roughly 20 years ago in Delaware when oil and gas interests wanted to drill in the Baltimore Canyon off the coast of the Delmarva Peninsula. This is clearly one instance where Federal law is necessary and effective and we ought to keep the ban.  Mr. President, I am terribly concerned that this move is yet another part of an overall antienvironmental agenda now being advanced. Whether it is the air we breath, the water we drink or the food we eat, there are increasing attempts to do away with reasonable health and safety protections.  Lifting the ban on offshore drilling--at a time when world oil supply and prices remain stable, and when the Republican budget proposal includes billions in oil sales from the north slope of Alaska--is unnecessary, misguided and just plain wrong.  Just one oil or natural gas spill, similar to the tragic Valdez accident, could permanently destroy miles and miles of pristine State beaches and boardwalk. Such an accident could also easily erase the decade of progress made in restoring the fragile ecosystems of the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays.  Due largely to concerns over these environmental risks, the Congress, in 1982, struck a fair balance between the need for expedited exploration and development, and the need to protect coastal environments.  This policy has been effective and has enjoyed bipartisan support. Oil and natural gas extraction in the most abundant areas has continued and even increased, generating tens of billions of Federal revenue, while the sanctity, beauty and safety of our coastlines has been preserved. A fair balance.  Yet now, in total disregard for the interests of coastal states, and ``States rights'' which is so often invoked and embraced, the House is attempting to upset this balance.  Mr. President, this is a perfect example of the proper role for Government in ensuring the safety of our environment and the health of our citizens. At a bare minimum, coastal states should have the authority to extend the moratorium to the Outer Continental Shelf adjacent to the States' coastline. That is why I have joined with the distinguished Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] in introducing legislation enabling States to reimpose this needed drilling restriction on their Outer Continental Shelf waters.  Yet, I remain terribly concerned that a more comprehensive approach, covering all of the Outer Continental Shelf, as we have had in the past, is what is needed.  Mr. President, I intend to fight vigorously to ensure the continued sanctity of our coastal communities and remain committed to the ban on offshore drilling.                          ____________________
