President, I rise on the Senate floor today to pay tribute to Mary Leahy, director at the Central Vermont Adult Basic Education--sister, friend, and lifetime educator--who is retiring this month.  For 40 years, Central Vermont Adult Basic Education has provided free literacy services for adults and out-of-school youth. Thirty-seven of those years, Mary Leahy has been at the helm. In her role as codirector at Central Vermont Adult Basic Education, Mary dedicated herself to preparing lower skilled workers to meet the demands of the shifting economy.  Whether it was attending townhalls, community centers and libraries, or knocking on doors directly, Mary has spread the word. She has recruited members for this program all over the State.  I have seen the joy in the face of a grandfather able to read a children's story to a grandchild--something the grandfather was not able to do for that child's parent because he could not read when they were a child.  In a recent article honoring Mary in the Times Argus, Vermont Poet Laureate Sydney Lea said these kind words about Mary:       This has been way beyond a job for Mary; it's really a      vision of humanity that she's been dedicated to. I have an      admiration for her that is pretty close to boundless.  I agree with my friend Sydney. Mary's lifelong passion for learning has enabled countless Vermonters to gain the critical skills needed to participate in today's workforce. In our country today, 88 million adults face at least one educational barrier, such as no high school diploma or no college, and only 3 to 4 percent of the workers with the most limited literacy proficiencies receive the basic skills training from their employers. Under Mary's guiding hand, Central Vermont Adult Basic Education has allowed Vermonters, young and old, to reach their full potential and to be successful both in the classroom and in the workforce--I might add parenthetically, also just in their everyday lives.  As her older brother, I have known Mary all her life. She is a loving, intelligent, and hard-working person. She has the soul and talent of an artist and the generosity of a saint in sharing her talent and commitment.  I am so proud of Mary, and I ask unanimous consent that the Times Argus article ``Closing a Chapter'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From The Times Argus, April 30, 2012]   Closing a Chapter: Mary Leahy Ends Career at adult Basic Education                           (By David Delcour)       Pages turn, chapters end, books close, and Mary Leahy--a      woman who has dedicated her life to literacy in central      Vermont--knows that better than most.       On Tuesday, Leahy plans to put the proverbial ``period'' at      the end of her 37-year career with Central Vermont Adult      Basic Education. The Marshfield woman's name has become      synonymous with the organization where she's worked for      nearly four decades.       And Leahy will tell you she's treasured every minute of it.       ``I'm surprised I'm leaving,'' Leahy said during a Friday      afternoon interview at CVABE's office on Washington Street in      Barre. ``This is what I am because the work is every bit at      the center of my heart.''       For those unfamiliar with CVABE, ``the work'' involves      providing ``free, individualized and confidential academic      services'' to folks who range in age from 16 to 90-something.       Many are high school dropouts, some are immigrants      struggling to learn English, and still others are challenged      by a growing ``digital divide'' that didn't exist back in      1975 when a much younger Leahy ditched her job as a high      school art teacher to try something completely different.       Seated in an armchair located in the shadow of a paper      mache version of Barre's ``Stonecutter'' memorial--this one      holding a book in an outstretched hand, instead of a hammer      at his side--Leahy said she has never regretted enlisting as      a foot soldier in one of the earliest fronts in the ``War on      Poverty.''       ``When this job opened up, I went for it and it's grabbed      every single bit of imagination that I have,'' she said. ``It      has been endlessly interesting and incredibly rewarding.''       It was also real work, according to Leahy.       ``Back then all of us were working out of our cars and      going here and there and everywhere,'' she recalled. ``I've      tutored in barns, I've tutored in churches, I've tutored in      restaurants . . . wherever people were and (wherever they)      felt comfortable.''       Leahy's initial assignment was to expand the then-loose-     knit, Barre-based program into five communities in      Washington, Orange and Lamoille counties.       ``That meant literally going through the hills and knocking      on doors and saying: This is a program, it's free, and do you      know anybody . . . who would find it helpful?'' she recalled.       Those trips, Leahy said, were as much a search for      ``students'' as they were an attempt to recruit volunteers,      whom, she is quick to note, have long been the backbone of      CVABE.       That outreach paid off, according to Carol Shults-Perkins,      who joined CVABE two years before Leahy and is the other half      of the organization's long-standing ``executive team.''       ``We've been delivering, and committed to delivering      community-based services here in central Vermont for more      than 40 years now, but it really was Mary (Leahy) who began--     community by community, town hall by town hall, library by      library engaging individual community members . . . and      ensuring that community partnership and community      participation has been part and parcel of the community-based      services we provide.''       According to Shults-Perkins, who will soon assume the role      as CVABE's first executive director, the thought of running      the organization without Leahy sharing the helm is going to      take some getting used to.       ``We have worked as a team for 35 years,'' she said. ``You      can't replace Mary (Leahy).''       Shults-Perkins won't get any argument from Newberry      resident and Vermont Poet Laureate Sydney Lea. Lea, an 18-     year member of CVABE's board of directors and its current      president, thinks highly of the woman who recruited him      during a chance encounter in a hospital parking lot.       ``This has been way beyond a job for Mary (Leahy); it's      really a vision of humanity that she's been dedicated to,''      Lea said.       ``I have an admiration for her that is pretty close to      boundless,'' he added, noting when he had to pick someone to      install him as poet laureate last year, he turned to Leahy.       ``She (Leahy) was the first person who came to mind,'' he      said. ``No fellow poets, no academics, just Mary.''       A soft-spoken, silver-haired woman, with kind eyes and a      tendency to deftly shift the focus of a conversation away      from herself, Leahy speaks passionately about the importance      of adult education, the courage of those who avail themselves      to the services CVABE provides, and the commitment of an      ever-changing cadre of volunteers who ``find the time in      their busy schedules to make a difference.''       It's a recipe that works, according to Leahy, who spent one      of her last days on the job pitching the merits of a program      that has been her life's work.       ``We're really the earliest of early ed(ucation)      programs,'' Leahy said. ``If parents are really important to      their children's academic success, then for the parents who      missed out on their own education, it stands to reason their      child is not going to be on an equal playing field with other      kids . . . That's where we come in.       ``If we can place ourselves in the public imagination as      part of the warp and weave of the entire fabric of education,      then we're there for people whose time is right,'' she said.      ``When they're ready to learn (and) they want to learn, we're      here to help.''       Leahy said she is in the process of sifting through an      office filled with notes, letters, and student work that      underscore the life-changing nature of a basic education.       ``It's like a memory tunnel,'' she said. ``I'm unearthing      all these wonderful things.''       One was a note from a then-newly computer literate woman      who thanked her CVABE teacher for helping her master modern      technology.       ``She was 90,'' Leahy said of the woman.       Although Leahy believes it is time for her to retire from      CVABE, she said she won't be going far and will likely add      her name to the organization's roster of volunteers.       ``I'll be around,'' she said.       Leahy will also be missed, according to Lea, who penned a      poem--``Her Eyes''--that he read at her recent retirement      party.       Here is what Lea wrote:                                Her Eyes     --for Mary Leahy, on her retirement     I asked your friends about your eyes--what color     They were, in a few short words. The answers ranged     From what I'd expect, like sparkling, penetrating,     To ones that were anything but: the earliest green     Of spring, said one, another brook trout green.     And yet the words they used around the colors     They'd chosen made a chorus: compassion, kindness,     Acceptance, faithfulness, honor. What can I add?     Only that in my knowing and loving you     These years, I've beheld within those eyes a shine     That none of us will ever quite describe:     A certain mystery flicker born of watching     Pain for years yourself, and from its kindling     In them what we, in our own crude ways, name hope.                          ____________________
