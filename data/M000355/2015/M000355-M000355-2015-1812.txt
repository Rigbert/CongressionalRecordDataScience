 President, as my good friend the Democratic leader reminded me for 8 years, the majority leader always gets the last word. So let me say again that the consent request that I offered, to which the Democratic leader objected, was unanimously approved on our side. What it would do would be to set up an order for amendments, rotating from side to side, which is exactly the open amendment process the Democratic leader seems to feel somehow we are preventing. That is exactly what I offered. I am not going to propound it again, but I will just lay out what it said: to offer amendments in an alternating fashion, with the majority manager or his designee being recognized to offer the first amendment. We would go back and forth and back and forth. So that is about as open as I can imagine. And there were no objections to it on the Republican side. Regardless of how Members who are being quoted by the Democratic leader may have observed the overall process for going forward, there is no objection over here to having amendments on both sides, alternating from one side to another.
