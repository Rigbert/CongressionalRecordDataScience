Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the motion to instruct conferees and just remind Members that I have held hearings in my subcommittee on the U.S. cooperation with the Indonesian military and I find it appalling that we have been training, especially through the JCET program, many of the people, including those who are part of Kopassus, which is an infamous brigade, it is the Red Berets, it is their so-called elite, many of whom have been charged with very serious human rights violations, including the use of torture.  We had Pius Lustrilanang, one of those who was tortured by the Indonesian military, appear at one of our hearings, and he gave riveting testimony of the daily beatings that he endured at the hands of those people.  Where we come in, or where the United States I think has made a very serious error, is that we have trained in sniper training, urban guerilla warfare, and other kinds of assistance to the very people in Kopassus and in other elements of the Indonesian military. And I asked our U.S. officials both in Jakarta, as well as at our hearings, did we keep track of those we trained. There is no list of those that we have trained.  Now there are several of those members who are under indictment. General Prabowo, who was the leader of Kopassus, has been sacked. But there are still very strong remnants of that kind of abusing authority still in place. We are seeing them now operate with impunity in East Timor.
