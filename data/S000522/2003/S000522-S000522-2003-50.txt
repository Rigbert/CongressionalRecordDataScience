Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of this rule and the underlying bill which will follow immediately thereafter.  I want to just point out to my colleagues that the concurrent receipt victory that is in this bill is significant, it is profound, it is historic, and will make a major difference in the lives of our men and women who have served ably and honorably in our military, have served for 20 years or more, and also have been disabled. It will provide that anyone who is service-connected disabled 50 percent or more or combat-related of any rating will get the full concurrent receipt after a phase-in of 10 years.  Let me point out to my colleagues that this adds about $22 billion in benefits over 10 years to veterans compensation. This is not an insignificant amount of money.  After the phase-in period, let me remind my colleagues as well that this bill adds about a $3.5 billion every year to service connected disabled vets. So the next 10 years we are talking about another $35 billion more that will go to our disabled veterans. That is in excess of $57 billion to our disabled veterans as a result of this legislation.  I want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter), the chairman of the committee, for his work, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), the gentleman from Missouri(Mr. Blunt), and so many others who worked on this to make sure that we get concurrent receipt resolved.                              {time}  1015
