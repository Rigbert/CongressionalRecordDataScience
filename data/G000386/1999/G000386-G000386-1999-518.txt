 President, today I have introduced the Hospital Transfer Penalty Repeal Act of 1999. This legislation would repeal the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA)'s hospital transfer penalty. This law punishes hospitals that make use of the full continuum of care and discourages them from moving patients to the most appropriate levels of post-acute care. I ask my colleagues to spend a few minutes learning about this issue, because I believe that if they do, they will come to see the need for repeal.  The current hospital prospective payment system is based on the average length of stay for a given diagnosis. In some cases, patients stay in the hospital longer than the average and in other cases their stay is shorter. Historically, a hospital has been reimbursed based upon an average length of stay regardless of whether the patient remained in the hospital a day less than the average or a day more than the average.  Under the Balanced Budget Act transfer provision, however, this is no longer the case. If a patient in one of ten specified diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) is released earlier than the national average length of stay for that DRG, the hospital does not receive its full prospective payment. Instead, it receives only a smaller per-diem payment.  This policy penalizes facilities that transfer patients from the hospital to a more appropriate level of care earlier than the average length of stay. It encourages hospitals to ignore the clinical needs of patients and keep them in the most expensive care setting for a longer period of time. In short, it offers an incentive for hospitals to provide an unnecessary level of care, for an unnecessary length of time.  The transfer policy is particularly hard on hospitals in low-cost states like Iowa. Because Iowa's hospitals practice efficient medicine, they have average lengths of stay well below the national average. These hospitals will be hit especially hard. This kind of perverse incentive is part of the problem with Medicare, not part of the solution.  In addition to the irrational incentives this policy creates, administering it is simply maddening for providers. As a knowledgeable Iowa constituent, Joe LeValley of North Iowa Mercy Health System, has pointed out, the law creates conflicting incentives that make clinical management of patients a baffling experience. Medicare now expects physicians to move patients to the most cost-effective level of care as quickly as possible--unless those patients have a condition in one of theseten DRG's, in which case Medicare wants the physician to keep them in the hospital. Is it any wonder that physicians and hospital administrators are frustrated with Medicare?  In fact, isn't it physicians, not hospital administrators, who should be making decisions about patient care settings? If we think that doctors should be determining the appropriate location for a patient, it seems absurd to force the hospital into that role. But the transfer penalty does exactly that.  In addition, the law holds hospitals accountable for the actions of patients that are no longer under their care. In some cases, patients are not admitted to post-acute care directly from the hospital, and the hospital may not know that the patient is receiving such care, let alone steer the patient to it. The law thus sets hospitals up for accusations of fraud due to events that are beyond their control.  I understand that there are valid grounds for concern about hospitals moving patients to lower levels of care sooner than is clinically appropriate, simply in order to game the reimbursement system. That is unacceptable conduct, and we do need to attack it. I am open to discussions on possible alternatives to outright repeal of the transfer penalty, if these bad apples are the ones targeted. But we need to make sure we don't punish all hospitals--especially the most efficient--for the sins of a few.  This transfer penalty is a serious roadblock to the provision of appropriate and efficient care. Its repeal will help ensure that logical coordinated care remains a primary goal of the Medicare program.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 37       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
