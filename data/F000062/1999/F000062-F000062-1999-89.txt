 President, I wish to thank Senator Gorton and Senator Byrd for all their hard work on the Appropriations Interior Subcommittee for bringing this bill to the floor.  In 1994, I authored the Desert Protection Act, which created two new national parks, Joshua Tree and Death Valley along with the Mojave National Preserve and 100 wilderness areas; thereby promising to protect more than 6 million acres of desert property. However, these parks and wilderness areas still contain hundreds of thousands of acres of private inholdings.  Earlier this year, the Wildlands Conservancy, a California non-profit, negotiated a one-time deal whereby nearly 500,000 acres of these inholdings, many of which are owned by the Catellus Corporation would be purchased by matching $36 million in funds from the Federal Land and Water Conservation Fund with $26 million in private donations.  Catellus, the Wildlands Conservancy, and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management subsequently signed a letter of intent to sell to the Federal Government up to 437,000 acres of California desert owned by Catellus. An additional 20,000 acres of property owned by others within Joshua Tree National Park would be bought and preserved.  All told, up to 483,000 acres of private inholdings in the California Desert will be acquired, ensuring public access to over 4 million acres of Federal national parks and wilderness areas in the California Desert.  The location of these particular inholdings are significant because this area serves as the gateway for both private landowners and for people who wish to use the public portions of the preserve. Acquiring this checkerboard of inholdings is the only to assure public access for the lands provided for in the California Desert Protection Act.  If the government does not purchase these lands the Historic Mojave Road and the East Mojave Heritage Trail are likely to be closed and it is also possible that there will be no more public access to large portions of the Mojave!  Government acquisition of these lands will protect endangered species habitat, keep the fragile Desert ecosystem intact, and improve recreation opportunities and access for millions of Americans.  This proposal enjoys overwhelming support from community activists, conservationists, private industry, elected officials, Democrats, Republicans, and everyone who recognizes what a great deal this is for the U.S. Government. In fact, even most opponents of the California Desert Protection Act support this appropriation because of the issue of public access. If these lands are not purchased by the government, 1,500 miles of roads will be closed off to hunters, recreationists and the general public.  This Interior Appropriations bill contains a line item of $15.1 million for the phase 1 purchase of these lands. Presently, there is no allocation in the House Interior Appropriations bill to fulfill the Federal Government's end of the bargain. These purchases have been held hostage in the House as a result of an unrelated U.S. Army expansion. Although this military issue does not directly affect any of the Catellus land holdings, it is preventing the appropriation of the necessary funding to execute these land purchases.  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Conference committee to ensure that the government follow through on its commitment to purchase these lands.                          ____________________
