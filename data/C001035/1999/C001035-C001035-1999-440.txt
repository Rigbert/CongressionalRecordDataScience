President, food safety is a serious and growing public health concern. According to the General Accounting Office (GAO), as many as 81 million cases of foodborne illness and 9,000 related deaths occur in the U.S. every year. Most at risk are the very old, the very young, and the very ill. While these statistics refer to all cases of foodborne illness, recent outbreaks demonstrate that tainted imported foods have increased the incidence of illness and have exposed American consumers to new pathogens.  The volume of imported foods continues to grow, yet our current food import system is riddled with holes which allow unsafe food to penetrate our borders. Contaminated food imports have caused illnesses rarely seen in the United States and can be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for consumers to detect.  I first became interested in this issue when I learned that fruit from Mexico and Guatemala was associated with three multi-state outbreaks of foodborne illesses--one of hepatitis A and two of Cyclospora infection--that sickened thousands of Americans. These outbreaks included victims in my home State of Maine.  In my State's grocery stores, as in any typical American grocery store, the fresh fruit and vegetables that are available during the winter months come from many other countries. In many ways, imported food is a blessing for American consumers. Fruit and vegetables that would normally be unavailable in our local grocery stores during the winter months are now available all year long, making it easier and more enjoyable to eat the five servings of fruit and vegetables a day the National Cancer Institute recommends. But, it's only a blessing if the food is safe. Even one serving of tainted food can cause sickness and even death.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reports that the increasing importation of produce is a trend that is expected to continue. In 1996, the U.S. imported $7.2 billion worth of fruit and vegetables from at least 90 different countries, a dramatic increase from the 1990 level of $4.8 billion. Total food imports have increased from 1.1 million shipments in 1992 to 2.7 million in 1997. And, of all the fish and shellfish consumed in the U.S., more than half is imported.  Yet, the FDA annually inspects less than 2 percent of the 2.7 million shipments of food that arrive in the U.S. And of the small number of shipments that are inspected, only about a third are tested for some of the most significant pathogens. What's more, even when the FDA does catch contaminated food, the system often fails to dispose of it adequately. Indeed, according to one survey conducted by the Customs Service in 1997, as many as 70 percent of the imported food shipments the FDA ordered re-exported or destroyed may have ended up in U.S. commerce any way. Unscrupulous food importers can easily circumvent the inspection system.  Mr. President, to respond to these problems, I am introducing the Imported Food Safety Improvement Act, with Senator Frist, Senator Abraham, Senator Coverdell, Senator Jeffords, and Senator Snowe as original cosponsors.  Our legislation is an effort designed to strengthen the existing food import system to help ensure that unsafe food does not enter the United States. Our goal is to reduce the incidence of foodborne illnesses and to ensure that American families can enjoy a variety of foods year-round without the risk of illness when they sit down to the dinner table.  This legislation is the product of an extensive investigation by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair. During the 105th Congress, the Subcommittee undertook a 16-month, in-depth investigation into the safety of food imports. During five days of Subcommittee hearings, we heard testimony from 29 witnesses, including scientists, industry and consumer representatives, government officials, the General Accounting Office, and two persons with first-hand knowledge of the seamier side of the imported food industry, a convicted Customs broker and a convicted former FDA inspector. As a result of the compelling testimony that we heard, I have worked with my colleagues in drafting the legislation we introduce today--the Imported Food Safety Improvement Act--to address a broad array of problems uncovered during the Subcommittee's investigation.  My Subcommittee's investigation has revealed much about the food we import into this country and the government's flawed food safety net. Let me briefly recount some of our findings which make it clear why this legislation is so urgently needed:  In the worlds of the GAO, ``federal efforts to ensure the safety of imported food are inconsistent and unreliable.'' Federal agencies have not effectively targeted their resources on imported foods posing the greatest risks;  Weaknesses in FDA import controls, specifically the ability of importers to control the food shipments from the port to the point of distribution, makes the system vulnerable to fraud and deception;  The bonds required to be posted by importers who violate food safety laws are so low that they are considered by some unscrupulous importers at the cost of doing business;  Maintaining the food safety net for imported food is an increasingly complex task, made more complicated by previously unknown foodborne pathogens, like Cyclospora, that are difficult to detect;  Because some imported food can be contaminated by organisms that cannot be detected by visual inspection or laboratory tests, placing additional federal inspectors at ports-of-entry alone will not protect Americans from unsafe food imports; and  Since contamination of imported food can occur at many different places from the farm to the table, the ability to trace-back outbreaks of foodborne illnesses to the source of contamination is a complex process that requires a more coordinated effort among the federal, state, and local agencies as well as improved education for health care providers so that they can better recognize and treat foodborne illnesses.  The testimony that I heard during my Subcommittee's hearings was troubling. The United States Customs Service told us of one particularly egregious situation that I would like to share. It involves contaminated fish and illustrates the challenges facing federal regulators who are charged with ensuring the safety of our nation's food supply.  In 1996, federal inspectors along our border with Mexico opened a shipment of seafood destined for sales to restaurants in Los Angeles. The shipment was dangerously tainted with life-threatening contaminants, including botulism, Salmonella, and just plain filth. Much to the surprise of the inspectors, this shipment of frozen fish had been inspected before by federal authorities. Alarmingly, in fact, it had arrived at our border two years before, and had been rejected by the FDA as unfit for consumption. Its importers then held this rotten shipment for two years before attempting to bring it into the country again, by a different route.  The inspectors only narrowly prevented this poisoned fish from reaching American plates. And what happened to the importer who tried to sell this deadly food to American consumers? In effect, nothing. He was placed on probation and asked to perform 50 hours of community service.  I suppose we should be thankful that the perpetrators were caught and held responsible. After all, the unsafe food might have escaped detection and reached our tables. But it worries me that the importer essentially received a slap on the wrist. I believe that forfeiting the small amount of money currently required for the Custom's bond, which importers now consider no more than a ``cost of doing business,'' does little to deter unscrupulous importers from trying to slip tainted fish that is two years old past overworked Customs agents.  All too often, unscrupulous importers are never discovered. The General Accounting Office testified about a special operation known as Operation Bad Apple, conducted by Customs at the Port of San Francisco in 1997, identified 23 weaknesses in the controls over FDA-regulated imported food. For example, under current law, importers retain custody of their shipments from the time they arrive at the border. The importers must also put up a bond and agree to ``redeliver'' the shipment to Customs, for reexport or destruction, if ordered to do so or forfeit the bond. However, Operation Bad Apple revealed a very disturbing fact. Of the shipments found to violate U.S. standards, thereby requiring redelivery to Customs for destruction or re-export, a full 40 percent were never returned. The Customs Service believes an additional 30 percent of shipments that the FDA required to be returned contained good products that the importers had substituted for the original bad products. Customs further believes that the violative products were on their way to the marketplace. This means that a total of 70  percent of products ordered returned, because they were unsafe, presumably entered into U.S. commerce.  Weak import controls make our system all too easy to circumvent. After all, FDA only physically inspects about 17 of every 1,000 food shipments and, of the food inspected, only about a third is actually tested. That is why we have worked with the FDA, the Customs Service, and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to ensure that our legislation addresses many of the issues explored over the course of the Subcommittee's investigation and hearings. Let me describe what this bill is designed to accomplish.  Our legislation will fill the existing gaps in the food import system and provide the FDA with certain stronger authority to protect American consumers against tainted food imports. First and foremost, this bill gives the FDA the authority to stop such food from entering our country. This authority allows the FDA to deny the entry of imported food that has caused repeated outbreaks of foodborne illnesses, presents a reasonable probability of causing serious adverse health consequences, and is likely without systemic changes to cause disease again.  Second, this legislation includes the authority for the FDA to require secure storage of shipments offered by repeat offenders prior to their release into commerce, to prohibit the practice of ``port-shopping,'' and to mark boxes containing violative foods as ``U.S.--Refused Entry.'' This latter authority, which would allow the FDA to clearly mark boxes containing contaminated foods, is currently used with success by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and has been requested specifically by the FDA. Our bill also will require the destruction of certain imported foods that cannot be adequately reconditioned to ensure safety. Third, the legislation directs the FDA to develop criteria for use by private laboratories used to collect and analyze samples of food offered for import. This will ensure the integrity of the testing process.  Fourth, the bill will give ``teeth'' to the current food import system by establishing two strong deterrents--the threats of high bonds and of debarment--for unscrupulous importers who repeatedly violate U.S. law. No longer will the industry's ``bad actors'' be able to profit from endangering the health of American consumers.  Finally, our bill will authorize the CDC to award grants to state and local public health agencies to strengthen the public health infrastructure by updating essential items such as laboratory and electronic-reporting equipment. Grants will also be available for universities to develop new and improved tests to detect pathogens and for professional schools and professional societies to develop programs to increase the awareness of foodborne illness among healthcare providers and the public.  We believe the measures provided for in this legislation will help to curtailthe risks that unsafe food imports currently pose to our citizens, particularly our elderly, our children and our sick. I appreciate the advice and input we have received from scientists, industry and consumer groups, and the FDA, the CDC and the U.S. Customs Service in drafting this legislation.  We are truly fortunate that the American food supply is one of the safest in the world. But, our system for safeguarding our people from tainted food imports is flawed and poses needless risks of serious foodborne illnesses. I believe it is the responsibility of Congress to provide our federal agencies with the direction, authority, and resources necessary to keep unsafe food out of the United States and off American dinner tables.                                 ______                                       By
