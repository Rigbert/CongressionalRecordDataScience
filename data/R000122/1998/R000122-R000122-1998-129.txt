Who is really suffering, if we do this, are the thousands of families in the country that won't have access to good health care. It is our responsibility to ensure that HCFA and the States provide real access to the hundreds of thousands of families that need good health care around the country. We just heard yesterday at a hearing about the struggles and travails of a young mother who was trying to get good care for her daughter in the context of Kennedy-Kassebaum, and without good enforcement she would not realize these benefits. I think you are absolutely right, Senator, in terms of the message we are sending. It is not, ``HCFA, get your act together.'' It is to thousands of families we are not going to enforce the right that we thought we gave 2 years ago.
