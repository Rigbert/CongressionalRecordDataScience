Speaker, next month this House will lose a dedicated public servant. Wilson ``Bill'' Livingood, our Sergeant at Arms, will retire after seventeen years keeping us safe. Since 1995, he has stood watch over the People's House and all of its members, staff, and visitors, overseeing the security of this chamber, the Capitol, and Congressional office buildings.  Under Bill's leadership, the House has adapted its security measures to meet new challenges faced since September 11. He has been a driving force in enhancing screening procedures while ensuring that Americans can still easily visit the Capitol and meet with their representatives.  Bill Livingood's life has been spent in service to our nation and to protecting the institutions of our democracy. Before his long service as Sergeant at Arms, Bill was an agent of the U.S. Secret Service for thirty-three years, placing his life on the line to protect our commander-in-chief.  While I have no doubt that the strong voice with which Bill has welcomed U.S. presidents and foreign dignitaries into the House chamber has become iconic, I believe he will be remembered here most for his warmth and kind-spirit and for his deep love of country. I have been fortunate to call him a friend and can attest to the attention and respect he commands from all who have known him. It has been a pleasure serving with Bill throughout his tenure, and I wish him all the best in his retirement.  I join with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle in thanking Bill for his long career of distinguished service to the people of the United States and, in particular, to their House.                          ____________________
