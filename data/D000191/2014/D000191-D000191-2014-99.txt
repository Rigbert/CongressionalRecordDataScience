  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, well, it is here. We have been waiting with bated breath for the Ryan budget, perhaps some of the biggest and most immediate problems confronting our Nation, things that will put people back to work and boost the economy.  For me, number one is the exhaustion of the highway trust fund, meaning, as of October 1 or earlier, the Federal Government will end all new authorization for State highway projects and bridge replacement and transit for 8 to 10 months because the highway trust fund is depleted.  If you look through the Ryan budget, it is the subject of three pages of narrative and is screed full of blather, but a close reading gets to a blueprint for the future of the national transportation system. He has a simple solution. We will end it. We will end it.  The legacy of Dwight David Eisenhower and a coordinated approach to a national transportation system, in the Ryan budget, it ends. He will devolve it, devolve it to the States. The 50 States assembled and the territories will be responsible for funding their own transportation system, and somehow it will serve national needs.  Let's stop this madness.                          ____________________
