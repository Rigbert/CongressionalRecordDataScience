President, we have had several people on the Senate floor this morning speaking of the Roberts nomination. I understand that we have several Senators on this side of the aisle who are going to speak in a few minutes, and I will yield the floor when they arrive.  I hope the American people will listen to this discussion. The outcome is sort of foreordained because we know the number of people who are going to vote for Judge Roberts, as am I. The reason it is important to hear all the different voices is that we are a nation of 280 million Americans. But for the Chief Justice of the United States, only 101 people have a say in who is going to be there and, of course, they are the President, first and foremost, with the nomination, and the 100 men and women in this Senate.  We have to stand in the shoes of all 280 million Americans. Can we be absolutely sure in our vote of exactly who the Chief Justice might be as a person, somebody who will probably serve long after most of us are gone, certainly long after the President is gone and actually long after several Presidents will be gone? No. We have to make our best judgment. I have announced how I am going to vote. With me, it is a matter of conscience.  I see the distinguished Senator from Colorado. I know he wishes to speak, and I will be speaking later about this issue. I will yield the floor to the distinguished Senator from Colorado.
