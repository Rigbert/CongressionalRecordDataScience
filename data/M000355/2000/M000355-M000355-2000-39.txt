 President, I rise today to honor my good friend and fellow Kentuckian, Bill Young, in recognition of his service and dedication to the state of Kentucky. As Bill steps down from a few of his many leadership positions, I pay tribute to him for his lifelong commitment to this region.  Born in Lexington, he has always focused on the state's higher education. Bill's many leadership positions, including Transylvania University Board of Trustees member and chairman of the board of Shakertown, have guided the growth and success of Kentucky. As he is known for his single-minded determination to help the future success of Kentuckians, he has left a legacy behind that would prove he is one of the state's greatest assets.  No opportunity has been missed by Bill to continue Kentucky's prosperity. Beginning with investments in peanut butter that is now better known as Jif, his business endeavors started successfully. With an interest in horses, he continued his success in the business world by becoming a prominent leader of thoroughbred racing. Over the years, he became a leading philanthropist by helping construct the YMCA located on Lexington's High Street, Shakertown, and the University of Kentucky's new William T. Young Library. He still continues other projects for the community that are significant and meaningful to him.  Kentucky would not be what it is today without Bill's leadership and guidance over the past years. Though Bill has stepped down for others to guide the future, Kentucky will feel the effects of his accomplishments for years to come. Thank you, Bill, for putting so much of yourself into this state to make it a better place for others. Your hard work and successes are admired, and they will continue to impact Kentucky for years to come. My colleagues join me in congratulating you on a job well done, and I wish you all the best for your future.                          ____________________
