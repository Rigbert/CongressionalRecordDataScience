 I would suggest to the Majority Leader that we passed a major tax bill that expires in 2010. So by its definition, therefore, it was temporary in nature, and, notwithstanding that fact, we passed it. I would urge the majority to apply the same logic to the child tax credit, to those families making less than $26,000 in our society, most in need of help, very frankly, as opposed to those of us who are doing much better and some, of course, doing much, much better than we are doing but we are doing well. So I would urge the gentleman to look at that.  With respect to the Medicare conference, we have heard some information on this side that the President and some of the majority conferees have reached an agreement that there is going to be an effort to reach agreement by October 17 in the conference. Is that information accurate?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, the information is accurate in the fact that it is a goal that both the House, the Senate and the President have placed on wrapping up the conference on Medicare. Obviously, this is probably the most complicated issue that we have had to deal with in many a year; and there are many different positions by many different Members, both in the House and Senate. So it is a very complicated issue; it is very difficult. People are working very, very hard to meet that goal. And if God is on our side, maybe we will meet the goal.
