Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington State, a member of the Committee on Ways and Means, for his remarks. And then that, of course, as the gentleman points out, is the purpose. The tax simplification purpose of ours is not going to be just tonight, it was not just 3 days ago when I gave a statement to the press and to others; it is a commitment that we have for all Americans to make this a fairer, simpler system for them and their families, and for every small businessperson in America so that they can feel that we are not placing an extraordinary burden on them.  Paying is burden enough. Complicating the system and causing them hours and hours and costs to comply is too much for them to expect, and we need to change it, and we Democrats are going to change it. I thank the gentleman from Washington for his remarks.  I now am pleased to yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Emanual), who has been very involved in our efforts to focus on tax simplification and who is a leader in this effort.                              {time}  2310
