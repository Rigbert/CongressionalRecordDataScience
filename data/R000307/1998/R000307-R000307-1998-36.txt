I have checked with a great many Senators. I thought it was pretty much common knowledge. I have checked with the chairman of the Subcommittee on Ag Appropriations, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, checked with Senator Dorgan, checked with Senator Conrad, and checked with others. I could go down the list. But I just did not anticipate that there would be an objection, and so consequently--or, more especially, when the very subject that Senator Daschle indicated is already in the Agriculture appropriations bill.  As a matter of fact, I think if we fund it now, you could make the argument that later down the road, in regard to disaster assistance, there would not be any more forthcoming. I apologize if it is my fault, if in fact I was supposed to run the trap line and I didn't run all the traps. I am sorry, but I just did not anticipate that this would be this much of a problem.
