In fact, a lot of it reflects legislation I have written and actually passed through the committee before. I have a couple of concerns, but one that comes to mind is that we don't want to hold out false promises to victims, and I know the Senator doesn't want to either.  I certainly support having any money that the traffickers are fined go to supporting this, but my experience earlier as a prosecutor and my experience now in talking to prosecutors around the country is that most of these people, when they get prosecuted, are basically judgment-proof--they don't have any money or they have a very small amount of money. They will go to prison. Who pays for that? Of course taxpayers pay for the prison, whether it is Federal or State. They will pay for the prisons, but there is no money for the victims.  What happens if the fine money does not materialize? We have talked about up to $30 million, I think, in fines, but let's suppose we only come up with a few thousand dollars in fines. Are we making a promise to these victims that can't be met? Is there an alternative for them in case the fines don't pay for it?
