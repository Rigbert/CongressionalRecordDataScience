. Senate, indeed, our entire Nation, is mourning the loss of a great leader, an American patriot, our colleague and friend, Senator John McCain.  I first met John McCain when I was a young staffer in Senator Bill Cohen's office and John was serving as the Navy's liaison officer. As a fellow Senator for the past 21 years, I knew him as a trusted colleague, a courageous legislator, and a close friend.  John was a true American hero who devoted his life to serving his country. Courage and character were the hallmarks of his military service as well as his work in Congress. In the Senate, he was a consequential leader on the most critical issues facing our country. John McCain was one of our Congress's most respected voices for a strong national defense and for good government. His word was as much his bond in Washington as it was to his brothers in arms in Vietnam.  I would like to share with my colleagues a story, I believe, that demonstrates the essential character of John McCain.  In November of 2010, John was part of a congressional delegation on its way to a security conference in Nova Scotia. Bad weather caused their flight to be diverted to Bangor, ME, where I live. I shortly received a phone call to come to the airport, and I went and welcomed John and my colleagues on their unplanned visit.  As it happened, the Troop Greeters of Maine were at the airport at the same time. This legendary group of citizens has greeted more than 1.5 million servicemembers either leaving to go overseas or returning home since 2003; never missing a single flight, even in bad weather or the middle of the night.
