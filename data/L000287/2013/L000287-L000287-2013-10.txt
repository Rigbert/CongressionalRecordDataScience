Levin, for yielding.  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the Pay China First Act. We are the United States of America, and we pay our bills. Madam Speaker, I cannot believe that this body would even entertain or consider a bill that puts the Social Security check of 56 million seniors and people after China. How can we justify putting 2 million American military personnel, many of whom are in harm's way, after China? That is not right. That is not fair. As a Congress, we can do better, much better.  Let me be crystal clear. Default is not an option. The United States of America pays all of its bills as they come due. This is the American way.  Let's stop playing games and do what is right; do what is just; do what is fair. Let's do what every American citizen has to do, pay our debts. I urge each and every one of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Pay China First Act. We have a moral obligation to do what is right.
