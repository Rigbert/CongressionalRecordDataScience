Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, someone who would protest so loudly must have something to hide.  All we have tried to do in this legislation is let the people and the Congress have a say. That is all we are trying to suggest in this legislation. So when one gives a presentation as radical as that was, something must be wrong. They must be trying to cover up what can and has happened.  We had a hearing on this, Mr. Speaker. We had a hearing. We had 10 witnesses all testify in favor of the bill but one. That is this administration. We had no participation from the other side. Not one showed up to listen to those private citizens, those landholders that have been abused by previous administrations and this administration because of the biospheres and heritage areas.  I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, he who protests too loud and tries to protect those trying to take away our rights may have something to hide.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon].
