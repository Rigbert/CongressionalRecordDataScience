Madam Chair, I rise today for each and every person who owns a home. I rise today for every American who has struggled to pay their mortgage each month. I rise for every person who has watched their home, their piece of the American Dream, slip away because they lost their job through no fault of their own or because they got cancer and are no longer able to work and pay their medical bills.  I rise to condemn what these bills are trying to do today. Make no mistake; repealing these programs will close thedoor on the American Dream for more and more Americans.  Madam Chair, when I was a young boy, my family did not own a home. My father was a sharecropper. My mother and father had to ``go without'' for years. They saved and they saved. They prayed. They waited. My father could never get a mortgage. Mortgages were not available where we lived. They were not available for families like mine. It's just the way it was.  In 1944, my parents bought a house with three rooms and 110 acres outside of a small town called Troy in rural Alabama. It cost us $300. I couldn't imagine that much money changing hands at once. I look around this Chamber, and I see some suits in this room that cost much more than what my father paid. Up until the time she died, my mother spoke about the day we moved in. How proud she was. It was a huge achievement for us. It changed everything. That house, that land, it was ours. Ours.  Looking back, I can't imagine what it would have been like to have lost it all for reasons beyond my father's control--the harvest or the weather or because it would fix someone else's bottom line.  Madam Chair, I know that buying a house is the biggest decision most people will ever make, and it is the greatest source of pride. For most people, their dream is their house. It was for me. When I bought my house, I thought of my mother and my father. His house made it possible for me to buy mine.  This American Dream is built from hard work. But that dream is also made of bricks and mortar. It's a house, Madam Chair. It is a home. And this Chamber is shutting the door on that house. They're locking the door on the American Dream. These two bills today would end two new programs that are helping struggling homeowners who have lost their job through no fault of their own. To me, it is unthinkable.  Madam Chair, I strongly oppose H.R. 836 and H.R. 830. We must stand up for the American homeowner. We must stand in their corner. We must not walk away from them in their time of need.  I urge all of my colleagues to stand with me and defeat these bills. Don't lock the door on the American Dream.  The Acting CHAIR. Are there any other amendments to section 3 of the bill under consideration? If not, the Chair is prepared to entertain other amendments.                 Amendment No. 5 Offered by Ms. Waters
