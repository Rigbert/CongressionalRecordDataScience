Speaker, I want to compliment the gentleman for his passion and for placing the net result of the architecture of NAFTA and all succeeding agreements that follow in its path like this proposed CAFTA because what we see is a system, an economic system, that is really very cruel, foisted upon societies that do not have the legal system nor the financial system nor the political systems to really allow the voices of the people to be heard in their chambers of government.  In Mexico, after people's wages were cut by 40 percent, the value of their buying power down by 40 percent post-NAFTA, nearly 2 million people in the countryside thrown off their land, what happened there, they got so angry, there have been protests in Mexico City of a million people. A million people. That is three times as many people as live in the major city that I represent. They could not have their voices heard any other way. There was a group of farmers that got on their horses from the different states in northern Mexico and central Mexico. They literally rode into the parliament to try to say stop it, this is hurting us too much.  That is about all they can do to make their voices heard unless they can change over their government. They come here and say to us, America, do you not realize what you are doing to us, whom you are in partnership with? They are begging us to help them improve their societies. Do we not have the greatness as a Nation that believes in freedom and the liberty for all people that we would use our powers, political, economic, moral, whatever they might be, to help these poor people? What is wrong with us? We have been hurt ourselves greatly by our jobs moving to Mexico and other places. We know how tough it is.
