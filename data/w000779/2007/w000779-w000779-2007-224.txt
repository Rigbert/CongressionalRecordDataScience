President, Senator Snowe and I said we would work to improve the Medicare Part D benefit ever since we voted for its passage. Senator Snowe and I think one of the most egregious errors in the Medicare drug benefit was to write into law that the Secretary cannot have bargaining power under any circumstances. That is why today we are introducing the Medicare Enhancements for Needed Drugs Act of 2007. This legislation lifts the prohibition on bargaining power and requires the Secretary to negotiate on behalf of seniors.  We believed that one of the most important things missing from the Part D benefit was cost containment--and allowing Medicare to negotiate for drug prices would be an important cost containment measure. Our legislation clearly prohibits price setting or the creation of a uniform formulary. What our legislation allows Medicare to do is to be a smart shopper--just as any consumer would be--by allowing Medicare to go in the market and use its clout just like any other big purchaser.  Under our proposal, the Secretary could negotiate in any circumstance, but must negotiate in several instances: for single source drugs for which there is no therapeutic equivalent; drugs for which taxpayer funding was substantial in its research and development; and for any fallback plan the Secretary must provide. In addition, our legislation requires the Secretary to provide a fallback plan if there is not comprehensive coverage, including coverage for the so-called donut hole, available in a region.  The Congressional Budget Office has stated there might be savings achieved if the Secretary could negotiate for single source drugs for which there is no therapeutic equivalent. To be good stewards of taxpayer dollars, to be able to strengthen the program and to help seniors truly save, we must look toward using every logical tool to lower costs. Not to try to achieve lower prices in areas identified as potentially saving the program, taxpayers and seniors would be foolish.  I don't know of a single private entity, whether it's a timber company in my home State of Oregon, or a big auto company, who when they're buying something in bulk doesn't say, hey pal, how about a discount? So why shouldn't Medicare, if it needs to negotiate, have that authority just in case? Why wouldn't we want to assure that Medicare can be a smart shopper?  I look forward to working with my colleagues as the Senate Finance Committee works on this issue.                                 ______                                       By
