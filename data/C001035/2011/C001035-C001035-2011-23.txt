President, disasters have affected nearly every State this year, and several States were hit particularly hard with devastating tornadoes and historic flooding. CDBG disaster recovery funding is an important tool that has helped States and communities address recovery needs related to infrastructure, housing, and economic development. I recognize that supplemental CDBG funding is important for communities recovering from disasters, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to help communities throughout the Nation.
