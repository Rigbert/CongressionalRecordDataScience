President, I have often said here on the floor of the Senate that by working together, we in America can build a better future for all of us. Rather than limit our potential with an every-man-for-himself philosophy, we should find ways to work together. Anyone who has ever played sports can recall their coach's encouragement to use teamwork. That was good advice for athletics and it's a good idea in public policy too. America could use a little bit more of a teamwork society.  Today I rise to introduce the Base and Community Lease-Purchase Expansion Act. The purpose of this bill is to provide more opportunity for military bases to enter into cooperative agreements with the governments of the communities in which they are located.  One of the options available to the military for obtaining the facilities and office space it needs is the lease-purchase agreement. In this sort of arrangement, the military service contracts with an entity that agrees to construct a building on military land. The military then makes lease payments over a term of several years. At the end of that term the building becomes the property of the government. Current law says that the military services may enter into an agreement such as this only with a ``private contractor.''  The bill I offer today expands the range of entities with which the military can enter into these agreements so that the door can be opened to cooperative lease-purchase arrangements between the military and governments at the local and State level.  We know from the recent round of base closures and realignments that communities across the Nation are closely connected to the military installations situated nearby. The health and prosperity of one has a direct effect on the health and prosperity of the other. It is only prudent to allow the two to work together when it will benefit both the base and the community to do so. And what more stable partner could a military base have than the local government that welcomes its presence and role in the local community?  In my own State of Illinois, for example, we are very proud to be host toScott Air Force Base, home to the United States Transportation Command, the Air Force's Air Mobility Command, and some tireless flying units that move troops and materials all over the world in defense of our Nation. St. Clair County, where Scott Air Force Base is located, has for some time been willing to discuss with the Air Force the idea of working together on a lease-purchase agreement. That idea cannot get off the ground; much less take flight, however, so long as the current law strictly limits such agreements to private contractors.  This is just one example from my own State of Illinois. I expect there may be other military installations and their neighboring jurisdictions that also might like to work together in a similar fashion. The Base and Community Lease-Purchase Expansion Act which I introduce today will help open the door to that sort of teamwork.  America is strongest when the military and civilian parts of our society work together in partnership on projects of mutual benefit. To that end we must work to reduce barriers and seize opportunities to foster cooperation between military installations and the states and local jurisdictions in which they are located. In so doing, we lay the foundation for mutual understanding, a strong military and enduring communities.                          ____________________
