NICKLES. To answer my colleague from Maine, the Senator is exactly right--although I say we protect the unprotected. Even in the State-regulated plans, we make sure all those plans have an appeals process.  ERISA, which is a national law that does deal with fiduciary standards, deals with reporting standards. We make sure there is also an appeals process that covers 124 million people. Maybe our colleagues on the other side forget that. That is a basic process which we think is much better than saying, let's go to court; you were denied coverage, let's go to court and sue. It may be 3 or 4 years and the plaintiff may eventually get something--or the trial lawyer may get most of the money. We say, instead of going that way, let's go through an appeals process. We formulate an excellent internal and external appeals process for 124 million Americans, broad based, for any employer-based plan.  That is a fundamental asset in our plan that will improve quality health care throughout the country.
