 In fact, a 1-week holdover in the Judiciary Committee is any Senator's prerogative--in fact, prerogatives I have used a few times myself--and over the last 2 years, the Majority has held over virtually all of President Bush's nominees for 1 week before a committee vote. Do you recall whether the Senate later confirmed any of these nominees who were held over?
