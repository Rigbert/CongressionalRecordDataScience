 President, I know the Senator from Kansas wants to speak, but if I can take a couple minutes to respond to some things the Senator from Montana stated, I think I should do that.  I yield to the Senator from Kansas such time as he might consume. I should wait until the Senator from Montana is on the floor before I give my response to him. I yield Senator Brownback such time as he consumes.
