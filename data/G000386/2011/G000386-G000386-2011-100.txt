  The law for this one company is that they were not given justice by bureaucrats who acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner and they were denied their rights under the law. So that company is taken care of because there was an impartial judge who believed they had been abused in their rights under Hatch-Waxman to be able to extend their patent.  You might be able to argue in other places around the country when you are likewise denied your right that you have this court case to back you up, but we cannot have one agency saying when a 60-day period of time starts for mail going in or mail going out to exercise your 60-day period, and for another agency to do it another way. That is basically what the judge said, that Congress surely could not have meant that.  The language of this section 37 does exactly what Senator Sessions wants, which is to guarantee in the future that no bureaucrat can act in an arbitrary and capricious way when they decide when does the 60-day period of time start. We put it in the statute of the United States so the courts look at it and the bureaucrats look at it in exactly the same way.  If you are a citizen of this country, you ought to know what your rights are. You ought to know that a bureaucrat treats you the same way they treat, in like situations, somebody else. You cannot have this sort of arbitrary and capricious action on the part of faceless bureaucrats that denies the rights. This puts it in statute and solidifies it so everybody knows what the law is, rather than relying upon one judge or in the future having to rely upon the court someplace else. I ask my colleagues not to support the Sessions amendment because it would deny equal rights to some people in this country, as this judge said those equal rights were already denied.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The time has expired. The Senator from Vermont.
