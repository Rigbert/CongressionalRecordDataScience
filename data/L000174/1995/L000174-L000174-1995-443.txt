President, reserving the right to object--of course, I shall not--I know the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire is on the floor and wishes to speak. He has already mentioned that. I know our side has been speaking for some time.  I wonder if we might know the order of the 10-minute order. Will the distinguished senior Senator from Virginia be willing to amend that to ask that the Senator from New Hampshire be recognized first in the order of those speaking as in morning business, and then the Senator from Vermont be recognized following that?
