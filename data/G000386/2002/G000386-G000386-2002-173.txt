 President, with today's vote on cloture on the trade bill, we move one step closer to reestablishing the United States global leadership and credibility in trade.  We move one step closer to being better able to advance this country's economic interests in this hemisphere. And we will be one step closer to bringing greater economic prosperity to every American family. That is because with today's vote, the President will be one step closer to getting one of the most important tools he needs to strengthen the American economy, and to create new American jobs.  American leadership in trade has floundered for the last several years. We have seen over 130 preferential trade agreements signed by our trading partners in the last few years, none of which included the United States. This proliferation of preferential trade agreements among other nations--including major U.S. trading partners such as Canada and Mexico--is harmful to U.S. trade interests. These agreements provide their members with preferential access to one another's markets--while disadvantaging American agricultural products, manufactured goods, and many services.  Some American companies overcome these barriers by producing overseas. Many small- and medium-sized companies can't do this however, and because they are less competitive, they lose opportunity after opportunity to their foreign counterparts. This loss of competitive ability by our export-dependent firms, as well as our farmers, means fewer jobs.  It means lost wages or income. It means that hard-working American families aren't able to pay the mortgage, or the farm loan, or provide better education or other opportunities for their children.  Today, as we speak, the United States is engaged in new global trade negotiations in the WTO. We played a central role in launching these negotiations. Last year, we helped draft a Ministerial Declaration--a roadmap for the new round of trade talks--that contained nearly every one of our priority negotiating objectives, particularly in agriculture. As a result, we are poised to win unprecedented new market access for American agricultural products around the world.  In my State of Iowa, we know how important trade is to the family farmer. We export more than $1 billion worth of everything we grow or produce on the farm, accounting for more than one-third of total Iowa exports to the world. Our farmers, our pork producers, our soybean growers all depend on the income they earn from exporting to take care of their families and their communities. And the plain fact is, they would have more export-related income if world agricultural tariffs were lower, and other trade barriers were reduced.  Restored United States leadership in free trade will benefit other as well. An aggressive, American-led effort to open world markets will mean more jobs for our highly competitive manufacturing sector. At the John Deere plant in Waterloo, IA, for example, one out of every five tractors built in the plant is exported, accounting for over 800 export-related jobs. If we gain access to more overseas markets through lower tariffs, we could sell a lot more of these tractors and create more jobs. Our service sector, which provides nearly 8 out of every 10 jobs in the United States, is even more reliant on open world markets.  Because we are so competitive internationally, we have an $83 billion trade surplus in services. Liberalization of trade in services is only 5 years old. The potential to build even more American export growth in services is tremendous. TPA will help us realize this potential. With today's historic vote, America's days on the sidelines are numbered. America is almost back in the game.  I want to commend Senator Baucus and his staff for all they have done in moving this bill forward, and for working on a bipartisan basis to help restore America's leadership in world trade.  Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on cloture.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from the White House.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              The White House,                                         Washington, May 22, 2002.     Hon. Max Baucus,     Chairman, Senate Committee on Finance.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley: On behalf of the      Administration, I wanted to thank you for all of your efforts      to produce a bipartisan trade package. Those efforts appear      to be nearing a successful conclusion with this morning's      cloture vote.       It is our hope that a substantial majority of the Senate      will vote to close off what has been a full and fair debate      and then proceed to final passage of the bill. In that vein,      I wanted you to know that the Administration     is opposing all further amendments to the bill. We hope that      you will join us in order to ensure prompt passage of the      bill.           Sincerely,                                            Nicholas E. Calio,                                    Assistant to the President for                                              Legislative Affairs.
