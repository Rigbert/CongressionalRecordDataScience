Mr. Leader, again, I say this with all due respect and seriousness. I read in the paper today that the conferees met last night. With all due respect, Mr. Leader, the conferees did not meet last night. Apparently, the Republican conferees met last night. You indicated both sides of the aisle. It is my understanding, from our conferees, that they are not being included in the discussions of the conference. Again, it is our perspective that cuts out about 125 million Americans that we represent on this side of the aisle from discussions about an issue that you have worked very hard on, Members on our side have worked very hard on, and that we all agree is critical to our country and to millions of Americans individually. I would hope, Mr. Leader, that you would prevail on the chairman of the conference to include our side of the aisle in the discussions.
