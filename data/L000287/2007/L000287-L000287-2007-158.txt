Mr. Speaker, I'm submitting the CBO cost estimate on H.R. 1562, the Katrina Housing Tax Relief Act of 2007.                                                    U.S. Congress,                                  Congressional Budget Office,                                   Washington, DC, March 23, 2007.     Hon. Charles B. Rangel,     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has      prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 1562, the      Katrina Housing Tax Relief Act of 2007.       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be      pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Emily      Schlect.           Sincerely,                                                  Peter R. Orszag.       Enclosure.     H.R. 1562--Katrina Housing Tax Relief Act       Summary: H.R. 1562 would extend and expand certain tax laws      specific to areas affected by Hurricane Katrina, which were      enacted in the Gulf Opportunity Zone Act of 2005. The bill      would also raise revenue by changing the collection due      process procedures for employment taxes.       The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates that      enacting H.R. 1562 would decrease revenues by $1 million in      2007 and increase revenues by $42 million over the 2007-2012      period and by $4 million over the 2007-2017 period. The      Congressional Budget Office estimates that implementing H.R      1562 would have discretionary costs of less than $500,000 in      2007 and 2008, subject to the availability of appropriated      funds.       JCT has determined that the tax provisions of the bill      contain no private-sector or intergovernmental mandates as      defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). CBO has      determined that the non-tax provisions (section 4) contain no      private-sector or intergovernmental mandates as defined in      UMRA and would impose no costs .on state, local, or tribal      governments.       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated      budgetary impact of the bill over the 2007-2017 period is      shown in the following table. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                              By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--                                          --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                            2007    2008    2009    2010    2011    2012     2013    2014    2015    2016    2017   2007-2012  2007-2017--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                 CHANGES IN REVENUES \1\ Low-Income Housing Provisions............       0       0     -61     -97     -53     -10        0       0       0       0       0      -221       -221Treatment of Repairs for Bond Purposes...      -1      -4      -7      -4       0       0        0       0       0       0       0       -16        -16Modification of Collection Due Process...       0      53      54      28      20      17       20      23      26       0       0       172        241Corporate Estimated Tax Payments.........       0       0       0       0       0     107     -107       0       0       0       0       107          0Tota1 Changes............................      -1      49     -14     -73     -33     114      -87      23      26       0       0        42          4    On-Budget............................      -1       6     -58     -96     -49     100     -103       4       5       0       0       -97       -191    Off-Budget...........................       0      43      44      23      16      14       16      19      21       0       0       139       195--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\1\ Assuming availability of appropriated funds, the cost of the Government Accountability Office report required by the bill would be less than  $500,000.  Note: Numbers may not sum to totals because of rounding.       Basis of estimate: For this estimate, JCT assumes that the      bill will be enacted by July 1, 2007.     Revenues       The legislation would reduce revenues through two      provisions related to areas affected by Hurricane Katrina,      and it would also raise revenues by changing collection due      process procedures for employment tax liabilities and making      other changes. All in all, JCT estimates that the bill would      increase revenues by $42 million over the 2007-2012 period      and by $4 million over the 2007-2017 period.       First, H.R. 1562 would decrease revenues by extending and      expanding low-income housing credit rules that were enacted      in response to damage caused by Hurricane Katrina. Generally,      low-income housing credits are subject to a cap. In response      to Hurricane Katrina, this ceiling amount was increased for      the states affected, for the years 2006 through 2008.      This bill would extend the higher cap for two years      (through December 31, 2010). It would also make changes to      the carryover allocation rules that specifies the time by      which the housing must be completed to still qualify for      the credit. This provision, JCT estimates, would reduce      revenues by $221 million over the 2009-2012 period.       Second, the bill would reduce revenues by treating certain      repairs in the Gulf Opportunity Zone (composed of areas      affected by the hurricane) as qualified rehabilitation for      purposes of certain bond rules. In general, qualified      mortgage bonds are tax-exempt and must be used for new      mortgages. Qualified rehabilitation loans, on the other hand,      may be used for replacing existing mortgages. Since the      hurricane, states in the Gulf Opportunity Zone have been      allowed to issue Gulf Opportunity Zone Bonds for construction      and rehabilitation of property. This bill would allow loans      financed with qualified mortgage bonds and Gulf Opportunity      Zone Bonds to be used for existing mortgages, regardless of      certain rules in place for normal qualified rehabilitation      loans. JCT estimates that this provision would reduce      revenues by $1 million in 2007 and by $16 million over the      2007-2012 period.       H.R. 1562 would raise revenue by changing collection due      process procedures with regards to employment tax      liabilities. Currently, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)      may seize a taxpayer's property given a federal tax lien.      Prior to seizing the property, the IRS must notify taxpayers      that they have a right to a collection due process hearing.      This bill would enable the IRS to seize property without      first having a hearing. JCT estimates that this provision      would increase revenues by $172 million over the 2007-2012      period and by $241 million over the 2007-2017 period. Of the      revenue gain, JCT estimates that a portion would be off-     budget--totaling $195 million over the 2007-2017 period.       Finally, one provision would shift revenues between 2012      and 2013. For corporations with at least $1 billion in assets      in 2012, the bill would increase the portion of corporate      estimated tax payments due in July through September of that      year. This change would increase revenues by $107 million in      2012 and decrease revenues by $107 million in 2013.     Spending Subject to Appropriation       Section 4 would require the Government Accountability      Office to report recommendations to the Congress on the use      of federal tax incentives provided to state and local      governments affected by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma.      Based on similar reports, CBO estimates that preparing and      distributing the report would cost less than $500,000 in any      one fiscal year.       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: JCT has      determined that the tax provisions of the bill contain no      private-sector or intergovernmental mandates as defined in      the UMRA. CBO has determined that the non-tax provisions      (section 4) contain no private-sector or intergovernmental      mandates as defined in UMRA and would impose no costs on      state. local, or tribal governments.
