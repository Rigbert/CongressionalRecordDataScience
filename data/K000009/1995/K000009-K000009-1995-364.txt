Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Gerald E. Edwards of Delta, OH, in my district. Mr. Edwards is to be honored by his community as the 1995 Delta Citizen of the Year. The award is indeed a fitting one, as he embodies all of the best attributes of the term ``good citizen.''  In addition to the insurance agency that he manages and the six properties he owns and maintains, Mr. Edwards has always found the time to engage in a multitude of volunteer activities. Always one to take the lead, he is an excellent example of one who takes his civic responsibilities seriously.  Committed to his community, Mr. Edwards has served as a long-time volunteer on the Delta fire/rescue squad, including his service as a past chief of the rescue squad. He is a past president of the Delta Chamber of Commerce and past president and past district governor of the Delta Rotary Club. Equally committed to his faith, he has served as an elder of the Delta Church of Christ. Currently, Mr. Edwards serves as the president of the Delta Family FOCUS [Friends of the Community United in Service] and as president of the Delta Library Board.  Perhaps most telling of his giving nature and commitment to his community is Mr. Edwards' Thanksgiving tradition of inviting members of his community who are without a traditional Thanksgiving meal to join him and his family for theirs. This past Thanksgiving, the Edwards family baked 30 pies, peeled 50 pounds of potatoes, cooked 5 turkeys, and picked enough green beans and served enough homemade applesauce, rolls, and coffee to feed nearly 200 people in Delta, OH, who may not have been able to experience the American tradition of Thanksgiving. He is truly an inspiration to those who know him.  Mr. Speaker, I know my colleagues join me in honoring a man whose sevice and responsibility to his community should serve as a reminder to us all of the limitless ability of one man or woman to improve and contribute to the lives in their community. Gerald Edwards of Delta, OH, represents in many ways the true meaning of citizenship. His contributions to the village of Delta have earned him a most deserved designation as its Citizen of the Year for 1995. I am honored to have this opportunity to recognize his selflessness and to represent him in the Congress of the United States.                          ____________________
