Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my full support for House Concurrent Resolution 96, authorizing the use of the Capital Grounds for the 22nd Annual Peace Officers' Memorial Service.  My own State of Alaska lost a peace officer during 2002 who will be remembered at this ceremony.  On November 19, 2002, while transporting prisoners to Spring Creek Correctional Center, Correctional Officer James Hesterberg was killed when the vehicle he was driving was struck head-on by a tractor trailer on the Seward Highway about 20 miles north of Seward, Alaska. A correctional officer for 19 years, he is survived by his wife and three children.  This service, honoring the 152 men and women who lost their lives while protecting our Nation, is a part of police week, which features events including a ``Blue Mass'' at St. Patrick's Catholic Church; Law Ride Motorcycle Procession; and a candlelight vigil, which will be held at 8:00 P.M. on Tuesday May 13.  I encourage my colleagues to support these important events, which honor not only the men and women who gave their lives while protecting our country, but the thousands of others that continue to do so.  I support this resolution and encourage my colleagues to give it their full support.
