Chairman, if I might reclaim my time and thank my colleagues for giving the additional information on this amendment.  I just say that, since this is not a question of whether or not the growers bought crop insurance, I have much more sympathy for the situation. Second, let me say I do not want Congress to put itself in a role of making scientific decisions, but I do believe that we want the very best and we want an objective decision which will, frankly, help all wheat growers.  Finally, let me say this should remind many of our colleagues, again, how critically important agriculture research is. We are looking at fungus problems with the corn crop. Here we have one with the wheat crop which literally may cripple some of our wheat growers in our home areas. So I hope my colleagues will stick with us in the future as we try to make sure that ag research receives adequate funding.
