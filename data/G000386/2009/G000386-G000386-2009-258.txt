 President, it is with great sadness that I rise today to call attention to a fallen hero. Cpl Jason G. Pautsch, a 20-year-old soldier from Davenport, Iowa, died on April 10, 2009 in Mosque, Iraq, of injuries sustained when an explosive device detonated near his vehicle. My thoughts and prayers go out to his parents, David Pautsch and Teri Johnson, his siblings Jared, Jacob, Josef, and Jenna, and all his friends and family.  Jason was the squadron leader in the Army's 4th Infantry Division and a graduate of Davenport North High School. Graduating a semester early so he could join the Army, Jason was deployed to Iraq last September. His family has a history of military service and his older brother Jacob is currently serving in the Army's 82nd Airborne.  Always a thrill-seeker, Jason enjoyed hunting and racing BMX bikes in his free time. His high school football coach describes him as a strong young man who was passionate about everything he did. Jason had an excellent sense of humor, was a tremendous competitor, and showed dedication in all he did.  Jason told his father David, he ``believed in what he was doing'' and his sense of patriotic duty is inspirational. I express the greatest respect and sincere gratitude on behalf of all Americans for Jason's commitment to our country. His is a true hero, and his sacrifice will not be forgotten.                          ____________________
