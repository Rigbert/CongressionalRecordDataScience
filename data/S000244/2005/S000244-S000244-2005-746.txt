Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3736) to protect volunteers assisting the victims of Hurricane Katrina.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 3736       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Katrina Volunteer Protection      Act of 2005''.     SEC. 2. PROTECTION OF VOLUNTEERS.       (a) Qualified Immunity From Suit.--Any person or entity      (including any Indian Tribe) that, in response to harm caused      by Hurricane Katrina of 2005, voluntarily, in good faith, and      without a preexisting duty or expectation of compensation,      renders aid (including medical treatment and rescue      assistance) to any individual, shall not be liable for any      injury (including personal injury, property damage or loss,      and death) arising out of or resulting from that aid that was      not caused by--       (1) willful, wanton, reckless or criminal conduct of that      person or entity; or       (2) conduct of that person or entity that constitutes a      violation of a Federal or State civil rights law.       (b) Preemption.--This Act preempts the laws of a State to      the the extent such laws are inconsistent with this Act,      except that this Act shall not preempt any State law that      provides additional protection from liability relating to      volunteers.
