Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I rise this afternoon in strong support of H.R. 2561, which increases to $1,000 per month the special pension payable to those veterans who have been awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.  To date, 3,455 Medals of Honor have been awarded for 3,450 separate acts of heroism. There are today 149 living recipients of this highest of awards. Fifty-five percent of the living recipients earned their medals more than 50 years ago while serving in World War II or in Korea.  In April of 1916, Madam Speaker, monetary benefits were first established for Medal of Honor recipients in the amount of $10 per month. In 1961, the rate was increased to $100, and not increased again until 1978. Public Law 95-469 increased this pension to $200. The Medal of Honor pension remained at $200 until 1993, when it was increased to $400 in Public Law 103-161. Congress again increased the pension to $600 in 1998.  Madam Speaker, the Medal of Honor is the highest award for military valor that can be bestowed upon an individual serving in our Armed Forces. It is only fitting that living recipients, who are real heroes, be accorded this special recognition for the most supreme acts of bravery and sacrifice for our country.  Madam Speaker, I want to commend the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon), the prime sponsor of this bill, for introducing it, for having the sensitivity to our great war heroes, and the great need that they have for this kind of recognition. It is a good bill.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time
