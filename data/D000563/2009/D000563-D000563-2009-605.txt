President, I rise today to congratulate a distinguished Illinois resident, Amy Meyer. Ms. Meyer is this year's recipient of the Service to America National Security and International Affairs Medal. This award honors Federal employees who have made significant contributions to our nation through their actions in the field of national security.  Since 2006, Ms. Meyer has served as the Director of the U.S. Agency for International Development's Office of Economic Growth in Pakistan. In this, her first Foreign Service assignment, Ms. Meyer has overseen an expansion of Pakistan's Office of Economic Growth from a small, two-person operation with a $7 million budget into a $200 million initiative.  Ms. Meyer has dedicated herself to leading the U.S. effort to foster economic growth in the country. Through her collaborative approach and the development of a wide range of programs, Ms. Meyer is bringing change to a country facing many problems, including a crippling energy crisis and the growing influence of the Taliban.  Of the many programs Ms. Meyer has developed, several focus on assisting the women of Pakistan. Among them is the Empower Pakistan: Agriculture Program. Through this program 1 million women will join dairy cooperatives where they will collect and store milk to be sold later at markets. Women who participate in this program will be able to earn income from these sales. Ms. Meyer also conducts focus groups for women in her own home and leads a yoga program which airs on Pakistani television.  As the 2009 Service to America National Security and International Affairs Medalist, Amy Meyer is honored for her commitment to working with the people of Pakistan to bring about economic growth and stability. I commend Ms. Meyer on her work in the Office of Economic Growth and congratulate her on receiving the National Security and International Affairs Medal.                          ____________________
