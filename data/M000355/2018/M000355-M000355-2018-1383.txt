   70th Anniversary of Israel's Independence and the Opening of the                      American Embassy in Jerusalem  Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, today marks 70 years since Israel declared its independence on May 14, 1948. Ever since, this brave nation has shown as a beacon of democracy in a troubled region and has stood as a valued friend of the United States.  It is fitting that another historic event took place just today. This morning, an American delegation, including top administration officials and several of our own colleagues, were on hand in Jerusalem, Israel's capital, to officially open the new American Embassy in that city.  I am proud the administration sent this clear signal on behalf of all Americans. We recognize the fact that Jerusalem is Israel's capital, plain and simple. That is where our Embassy belongs. Now, thanks to the President's decision, that is where it will be.                       Well Wishes for Harry Reid  Mr. President, on one final subject, the Senate's thoughts this afternoon are with our former colleague, the previous Democratic leader, Senator Reid, who underwent surgery today for a pancreatic tumor. According to his family's statement, the procedure went well, and chemotherapy will follow in the days ahead.  So, Harry, let me say that we are all in your corner, and we wish you the very best in this fight.                          ____________________
