 President, so that the majority gets to go last, I have 2 minutes remaining.  What the Senator from Oklahoma just read was moving and significant. I am going to vote for this bill, but I am dumbfounded why, after reading what he just read and us knowing that, that we all voted in this Chamber to allow someone to teach somebody how to build another fertilizer bomb, even if the person teaching knew or had reason to believe it would be used for a purpose like that.  Hear what I just said? ``Intended.'' If a person teaches someone how to build a fertilizer bomb intending that that be able to be done, a crime to be able to be committed with it, we just voted not to put that prohibition into the law.  And now that you all are here and did not have a chance to listen to this before, I hope you know, after we pass this bill, you will join me tomorrow, orthe next day, to pass a law that says you cannot do that, because you inadvertently voted, when I tried to put it back in the law, to let someone now, legally, over the Internet or any other way, teach someone how to build a fertilizer bomb, give them the details and intend that it be used that way, and it is not prohibited.  So I hope tomorrow when I am here, or the next day, listening to what the Senator from Oklahoma accurately stated and believes deeply that we should never let this happen again; we will correct the mistake that we made here today.
