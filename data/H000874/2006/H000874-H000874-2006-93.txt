Leader, of course I appreciate your reiterating what we did and we all understand what we did. There are different perspectives on what we did. But I would reiterate this side's strong desire and hope that we would consider the issue of minimum wage on its own merits, as was done in the committee. As you know, it was passed in a bipartisan fashion in committee with one-fourth, I think, or maybe one-fifth of the Republicans in the committee voting for it.
