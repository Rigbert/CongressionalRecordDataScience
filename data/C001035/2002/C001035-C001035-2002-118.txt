I am so pleased that it appears we are on the verge of finally passing a very balanced, reasonable, and bipartisan bill to keep our economy on the road to recovery.  It has been a long struggle, back and forth, between the House and the Senate and between the two parties, and now it is great to see us all coming together on a consensus bill.  I thank the House leadership, and in particular Chairman Bill Thomas for all the work he has done in putting together this excellent legislation.  I am particularly pleased that the bill includes two provisions about which I care a great deal.  The first is the extension of unemployment compensation for displaced workers for an additional 13 weeks. Last October, I introduced the first bipartisan bill to extend unemployment benefits for workers who had exhausted their regular State benefits and yet still have been unable to find new work or to be rehired because of the weak economy. These workers need our help.  We know that in January alone some 370,000 unemployed workers exhausted their benefits, up 63 percent from the year before. The situation is similar in Maine. We experienced a large increase in the number of unemployed workers who have been unable to find new work and have exhausted their normal 26 weeks of State unemployment benefits.  This extension could help some 3 million unemployed workers, many of whom lost their jobs either as a direct or indirect result of September 11 or have been affected by the recession that our country just now seems to be on the verge of pulling out of.  I know the Presiding Officer has been very concerned about the large number of unemployed Americans living in her State which has experienced one of the higher jumps in unemployment insurance. I know this is a provision she has been a strong advocate for as well.  The second provision on which I want to comment tonight is one that is very near and dear to me. It is a provision I have worked on for the past 3 years, originally with Senators Coverdell and Kyl, and more recently with Senators Warner and Landrieu.  Just Tuesday, President Bush spoke about the need to support our elementary and secondary education teachers, to help them bring out the best in their students, our children. Now we are close to passing another milestone in our journey toward the goal of supporting our teachers.  The provision to which I am referring is known as the teacher tax provision. It is a provision that has been included in the economic recovery package that would establish an above-the-line deduction of up to $250 to compensate teachers for a small part of what they invest in our children.  This tax deduction would be available to teachers who dip deep into their own pocket in order to buy supplies, materials, or books for their classrooms. This above-the-line deduction would be available for teachers, teacher's aides, principals, and counselors to help reimburse them in just a small way for the books, supplies, and equipment they purchase for their students.  I notice the Senator from Iowa is in the Chamber. He has been very helpful with this provision as well. I thank him, too.  Just last year, we passed landmark legislation reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. A principal goal of this bill is to promote teacher excellence. We know that other than involved parents, the most important predictor of a student's success is a quality teacher.  I have visited close to 100 schools in the State of Maine, and I have seen firsthand how dedicated our teachers are. They deserve our support. This is a way we can recognize the selfless efforts of our teachers and the financial sacrifices they make in entering the field of teaching and also in making purchases to improve the classrooms where they teach.  According to a study by the National Education Association, the average classroom teacher spends more than $400 a year out of his or her own pocket in order to buy supplies or materials or books for the classroom. This sacrifice is typical of the dedication of America's teachers to their students.  So often teachers in Maine and throughout the country spend their own money to better the classroom experiences of their students. Let me cite an example. I have spoken to dozens of teachers who have told me about their efforts to improve the quality of their teaching by giving their students access to supplies and other materials they would not otherwise have.  One example is Idella Harter. She is president of the Maine Education Association. One year, Idella saved all of her receipts from the purchases of classroom materials. She started adding up the receipts and was startled to discover she had spent over $1,000 of her own money to enrich the educational experience of her students. She told me she decided after she got to $1,000, she had better stop counting.  The relief our Tax Code now provides to our teachers is simply not sufficient because most teachers do not itemize so they do not get the benefit of the tax deduction for the supplies for their classroom. By changing the system so that we now have an above-the-line tax deduction, we will help many more teachers. By allowing them to take an above-the-line deduction for classroom expenses, this provision takes a fair, progressive approach that will provide just a bit of thanks and a little bit of incentive and financial relief to our schoolteachers. It will also encourage additional spending on classroom supplies.  The teacher tax provision of the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act helps teachers to go that extra mile for their students. We have all seen them. We know how dedicated they are. We know the difference they have made in our own lives. As President Bush has eloquently noted, teachers sometimes lead with their hearts and pay with their wallets. This provision would reimburse educators for a small part of what they invest in our children's future.  I hope we will clear this bill very shortly and pass it either tonight or first thing tomorrow morning. I hope all of my colleagues will join in a strong vote for this important legislation.  I thank the Presiding Officer for allowing me to comment on these two important provisions. I am delighted to see two of my top legislative priorities on the verge of being signed into law.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
