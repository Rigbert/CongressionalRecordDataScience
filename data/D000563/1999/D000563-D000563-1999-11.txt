The Senator from Nevada knows as well as I do that unless and until we face the reality that every American citizen and every American family deserves the peace of mind of health insurance coverage, you will continue to see employers deciding not to offer health insurance protection, and working, lower income people in America will be without the protection of either Medicaid or health insurance at work. These people get sick as other people do. When they present themselves to hospitals, they receive charity treatment which is paid for by everyone, instead of receiving quality health care from the start. Preventive care can avoid serious illness.  Again, it is an issue that this Congress has refused to address.
