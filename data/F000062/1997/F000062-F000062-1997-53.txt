 President, the Senate today is considering the Ashcroft amendment to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts. I oppose the amendment. There are also several amendments that seek to restrict, censor, or block grant the NEA.  Mr. President, in my view, the arts play an enormously important role in shaping our national culture and our local communities. The question is what is the best way for the Federal Government to fund the arts, if at all.                            nea is a success  Since the NEA's creation in 1966, there has been an explosion of community arts in local communities throughout the country. There are 8 times more nonprofit theaters, 7 times more dance companies, and 4 times more orchestras and opera companies. The impact of the National Endowment is far reaching. Through sponsorship of the arts, the NEA can stimulate expressions of our national character in many localities and guide our young people and pump hundreds of millions of dollars into local economies. Mr. President, if it were not for the strong leadership of the NEA, many rural areas and impoverished communities would be denied the opportunity to experience artistic presentations, performances, and education.                           academic benefits  Exposure to the arts has academic benefits. According to College Entrance Examination Board, students with more than four years of course work in the arts score 59 points higher on the verbal and 44 points higher on the math portions of the SAT. Children with a background in piano have also scored better in math.                           economic benefits  The National Endowment for the Arts contributes to our national economy. For every $1 spent by the NEA, $34 are returned to the U.S. Treasury. Because of the Endowment's support of the arts, the arts industry has boomed. Every $1 spent by the NEA attracts $12 to the arts from other sources. The nonprofit are industry now generates $37 billion annually in economic activity. The nonprofit arts industry also employs nearly 1.3 million Americans and represents nearly one percent of the entire U.S. work force.                              block grants  Some of my colleagues believe that all of the NEA's funds should go to the states in the form of block grants. Under current law, states have direct control over 35% of NEA funds in the form of block grants and state arts agencies believe this is the appropriate federal-state balance.                       losses under block grants  If further block granting is successful, states will lose hundreds of national grants that benefit all Americans. For example, according to the NEA, under block granting shows on public television like Great Performances, Dance in America, American Playhouse, and American Masters will be lost. 98% of American homes have access to public television--a great example of one grant having a huge national impact. Programs of this large scale are best run, are most efficiently run, on a national level. Most states cannot take on a project of this magnitude. Another national program that the NEA says will be eliminated under block granting is the Mayor's Institute on City Design, in which over 300 of the nation's mayors have had the opportunity to meet with planners and architects to discuss urban design issues. This single grant benefited over 300 American communities.                          privatization of nea  Other members of this body would like to privatize the National Endowment for the Arts. I believe this would be a grave mistake. According to Independent Sector's 1996 Giving and Volunteering survey, households giving to the arts, culture, and humanities has decreased by 29 percent since 1987. ``Giving USA'' found that total donations to the arts and humanities declined by $270 million between 1992 and 1995 and private donations to the arts and humanities decreased by 7.7 percent in 1992 and to 6.9 in 1995. These statistics do not bode well for arts without the support of a federal endowment.                        controversial nea grants  I have heard some Senators criticize the questionable content of past NEA grants. I agree there have been mistakes. Yet, throughout the NEA's 30-year history, ``objectionable'' grants have amounted to only 45 out of more than 112,000 grants. This figure translates to approximately four-one-hundredths of 1 percent of all grants. Few other federal agencies can claim the same small proportion of error or high rate of success.                              new reforms  NEA grantees must now adhere to strict guidelines to ensure quality content: all grants to individual artists have been eliminated, all grants to organizations must be for grants specifically described in the application, all grantees must file interim and final project reports, and all grantees must seek written permission in advance to change grant activities proposed in the organizational application.  In conclusion, Mr. President, I remind my colleagues that most great civilizations are remembered primarily for their arts. Already, the United States spends nearly fifty times less on the arts than any of its major allies. The National Endowment for the Arts represents a national commitment to our nation's culture, history, and people. If the NEA were to be privatized, block granted, or eliminated, not only would we suffer a great economic loss, but more importantly Americans, particularly those living in rural and low-income areas, would suffer a great loss. The NEA benefits our young people, our communities, and our economy. We cannot deny our citizens this national treasure.
