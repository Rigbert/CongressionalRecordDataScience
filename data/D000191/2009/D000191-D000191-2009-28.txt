Speaker, earlier today the House passed a bill that will give relief to about a quarter of the Nation's seniors on Social Security by not having them experience a Medicare premium increase this year. That's all well and good and meritorious. Times are tough. But it doesn't go to the other three-quarters of the Nation's Social Security recipients, and it doesn't get to the bottom line that there is, for the first time since we had a regularly adjusted Social Security COLA--it used to be into the fifties and early sixties before we put in place a regular COLA, a cost of living adjustment for seniors on Social Security. They would get one in election years, strangely enough. The Congress would wake up, notice that seniors were out there and give them some sort of an increase.  We fixed that problem many years ago by saying, Well, Social Security benefits would be automatically adjusted. But the measure that is used is incredibly flawed, and it was not only flawed to begin with. The cost of living index is calculated on a lot of things that seniors don't buy, things that have gotten cheaper in this bad economy, actually, like giant flat screen televisions, computers and cell phones and other things that are not consumed to any great extent by our Nation's seniors.  But if anybody has checked the price of pharmaceuticals or medical care or basic utilities or many other must-have expenses, they haven't gone down. In fact, they've gone up. But seniors, some of whom are living only on a Social Security check, many who are principally dependent upon a Social Security check, are not going to get a cost of living adjustment this year because the formula that is used is faulty. It's not only faulty; it was actually tampered with by the Republicans and Alan Greenspan, that great guru, the guy who helped almost destroy the world's economy recently through his deregulationist philosophy which became so embedded that Wall Street ran wild.  Alan Greenspan has always hated Social Security since he was on a commission many years ago and tried to find ways to go after it. A number of years ago he convinced a Republican Congress that the cost of living index actually overestimated inflation and that you should take away one point before you give a COLA to seniors on Social Security. The Republican Congress did that.  Now here we are today. We have a Democratic Congress. We're being told that there is no inflation; seniors won't get a COLA. The Obama administration says probably for 2 years they won't get a cost of living adjustment. That's not right. The things they are buying are going up in price, dramatically, and they're having tremendous difficulties making ends meet, living on that fixed income.  I have had a bill for many years that would put in place a new cost of living index for seniors called a CPIE--elderly--to look at the things they really buy and have to buy to live and get by. That hasn't gone anywhere, but I'm still pushing that idea.  But while we're working on developing a true index that would really look at the costs for seniors, we should pass a 1-year cost of living adjustment. And we can do that without borrowing the money, with no impact to the Social Security trust fund, very simply. We would just say that those who earn between $250,000 a year and $359,000, they would pay the same rate of Social Security tax as every normal wage-earning American who earns less than $106,000 a year. If you earn less than $106,000 a year, you pay Social Security tax on every penny of your income. If you earn $250,000, well, no, you just pay on the first $106,000. You don't pay after that. Your tax rate is lower.  Let's have a little bit of equity here. So we would simply have people earning between $250,000 and $359,000 pay the same rate of Social Security tax as every other American that would pay for a one-time COLA for seniors to help them make ends meet. We must act and act soon to get this done before this injustice happens next year.                          ____________________
