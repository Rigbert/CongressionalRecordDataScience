President, in June 1999, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a pair of decisions that altered the legal landscape with respect to intellectual property. I am referring to the Florida Prepaid and College Savings Bank cases. The Court ruled in these cases that States and their institutions cannot be held liable for patent infringement and other violations of the Federal intellectual property laws, even though they can and do enjoy the full protection of those laws for themselves.  About 4 months after the Court ruled in these cases, I introduced a bill that responded to the Court's decisions. The Intellectual Property Restoration Act of 1999 was designed to restore Federal remedies for violations of intellectual property rights by States.  I regret that the Senate Judiciary Committee did not consider my legislation during the last Congress, and that the Senate has yet to give any attention to the nearly 2-year-old Supreme Court decisions that opened such a troubling loophole in our Federal intellectual property laws. We should delay no further.  Today, I am introducing the Intellectual Property Protection Restoration Act of 2001, IPPRA. This legislation builds on my earlier proposal and on the helpful comments I received on that proposal from legal experts across the country. In particular, I would like to thank Justin Hughes, David Carson, Steve Tepp, Michael Kirk, Michael Klipper, and John Kent for their assistance in improving and refining this legislation. I also want to thank the House sponsors of the counterpart bill, Howard Coble and Howard Berman, who are the chairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property.  The IPPRA has two essential components. First, it places States on an equal footing with private parties by eliminating any damages remedy for infringement of State-owned intellectual property unless the State has waived its immunity in Federal suits for infringement of privately owned intellectual property. Second, it improves the limited remedies that are available to enforce a nonwaiving State's obligations under Federal law and the United States Constitution. I will discuss both provisions in more detail later in these remarks.  Innovation and creativity have been the fuel of our national economic boom over the past decade. The United States now leads the world in computing, communications and biotechnologies, and American authors and brand names are recognized across the globe.  Our national prosperity is, first and foremost, a tribute to American ingenuity. But it is also a tribute to the wisdom of our Founding Fathers, who made the promotion of what they called ``Science and the Useful Arts'' a national project, which they constitutionally assigned to Congress. And it is no less of a tribute to the successive Congresses and administrations of both parties who have striven to provide real incentives and rewards for innovation and creativity by providing strong and even-handed protection to intellectual property rights. Congress passed the first Federal patent law in 1790, and the U.S. Government issued its first patent the same year, to Samuel Hopkins of my home State of Vermont. The first Federal copyright law was also enacted in 1790, and the first Federal trademark laws date back to the 1870s.  The Supreme Court has long recognized that intellectual property rights bear the hallmark of true constitutional property rights, the right of exclusion against the world, and are therefore protection against appropriation both by individuals and by government. Consistent with this understanding of intellectual property, Congress has long ensured that the rights secured by the Federal intellectual property laws were enforceable against the Federal Government by waiving the government's immunity in suits alleging infringements of those rights.  No doubt Congress would have legislated similarly with respect to infringements by State entities and bureaucrats had there been any doubt that they were already fully subject to Federal intellectual property laws. But there was no doubt. States had long enjoyed the benefits of the intellectual property laws on an equal footing with private parties.  By the same token, and in accordance with the fundamental principles of equity on which our intellectual property laws are founded, the States bore the burdens of the intellectual property laws, being liable for infringements just like private parties. States were free to join intellectual property markets as participants, or to hold back from commerce and limit themselves to a narrower governmental role. The intellectual property right of exclusion meant what it said and was enforced even-handedly for public and private entities alike.  This harmonious state of affairs ended in 1985, with the Supreme Court's announcement of the so-called ``clear statement'' rule in Atascadero State Hospital versus Scanlon. The Court in Atascadero held that Congress must express its intention to abrogate the States' 11th Amendment immunity ``in unmistakable language in the statute itself.'' A few years later in Pennsylvania versus Union Gas Co., the Supreme Court assured us that if the intent to abrogate were expressed clearly enough, it would be honored.  Following Atascadero, some courts held that States and State entities andofficials could escape liability for patent, copyright and trademark infringement because the patent, copyright and trademark laws lacked the clear statement of congressional intent that was now necessary to abrogate State sovereign immunity.  To close this new loophole in the law, Congress promptly did precisely what the Supreme Court had told us was necessary. In 1990 and 1992, Congress passed three laws--the Patent and Plant Variety Protection Remedy Clarification Act, the Copyright Remedy Clarification Act, and the Trademark Remedy Clarification Acts. The sole purpose of the Clarification Acts was to make it absolutely, unambiguously, 100 percent clear that Congress intended the patent, copyright and trademark laws to apply to everyone, including the States, and that Congress did not intend the States to be immune from liability for money damages. Each of the three Clarification Acts passed unanimously.  In 1996, however, by a five-to-four-vote, the Supreme Court in Seminole Tribe of Florida versus Florida reversed its earlier decision in Union Gas and held that Congress lacked authority under article I of the Constitution to abrogate the States' 11th amendment immunity from suit in Federal court.  Then, on June 23, 1999, by the same bare majority, the Supreme Court in Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board versus College Savings Bank told us that it did not really mean what it said in Atascadero and invalidated the Patent and Plant Variety Protection Remedy Clarification Act. In the companion case decided on the same day, College Savings Bank versus Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board, the same five Justices held that the Trademark Remedy Clarification Act also failed to abrogate State sovereign immunity.  The Florida Prepaid decisions have been the subject of bipartisan criticism. In a floor statement on July 1, 1999, I highlighted the anti-democratic implications of the approach of the activist majority of the Supreme Court, who have left constitutional text behind, ripped up precedent, and treated Congress with less respect than that due to an administrative agency in their haste to impose their natural law notions of sovereignty as a barrier to democratic regulation. I also noted that ``the Court's decisions will have far-reaching consequences about how * * * intellectual property rights may be protected against even egregious infringements and violations by the states.''  One of my Republican colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, Senator Specter, expressed similar concerns in a floor statement on August 5, 1999. He noted that the Court decisions ``leave us with an absurd and untenable state of affairs,'' where ``states will enjoy an enormous advantage over their private sector competitors.''  Charles Fried, a professor at Harvard Law School and former Solicitor General during the Reagan administration, has called the Florida Prepaid decisions ``truly bizarre.'' He observed in an op-ed piece in the New York Times:       [The Court's decisions] did not question that states are      subject to the patent and trademark laws of the United      States. It's just that when a state violates those laws--as      when it uses a patented invention without permission and      without paying for it--the patent holder cannot sue the state      for infringement. So a state hospital can manufacture      medicines patented by others and sell or use them, and state      schools and universities can pirate textbooks and software,      and the victims cannot sue for infringement.       It is hard to see what sense this makes, and the claim that      ``the Constitution made me do it'' is particularly      unconvincing. The 11th Amendment does protect states from      suits in Federal courts by residents of other states--a      provision almost certainly not intended to protect states      from suits based on Federal law.  Not surprisingly, alarm has also been expressed in the business community about the potential of the Court's recent decisions to harm intellectual property owners in a wide variety of ways. A commentary in Business Week offered these cautions:       Watch out if you publish software that someone at a state      university wants to copy for free . . . Watch out if you own      a patent on a medical procedure that some doctor in a state      medical school wants to use. Watch out if you've invested      heavily in a great trademark, like Nike's Swoosh, and a      bureaucrat decides his state program would be wildly promoted      if it used the same mark.  I believe that these concerns are real. As Congress acknowledged when it waived Federal sovereign immunity in this area, it would be naive to imagine that reliance on the commercial decency of the government and its myriad agencies and officials would provide the security needed to promote investment in research and development and to facilitate negotiation in the exclusive licensing arrangements that are often necessary to bring valuable products and creations to market. Indeed, the good intentions of government may be beside the point, if businesses are unwilling to enter into agreements because one side cannot be bound by the law.  Since the Court issued its decisions in June 1999, intellectual property scholars and practitioners across the country have come together to explore ways for Congress to restore protection for federal intellectual property rights as against the States. The Patent and Trademark Office hosted a particularly enlightening conference in March 2000, in cooperation with the American Intellectual Property Law Association and the Intellectual Property Section of the American Bar Association. I commend the PTO for taking the initiative on this important issue.  More recently, in September 2001, the General Accounting Office released a report requested by Senator Orrin Hatch on State Immunity in Infringement Actions. The GAO's research confirmed that, after Florida Prepaid, owners of intellectual property have few alternatives or remedies available against State infringements. A State cannot be sued in Federal court for damages except in the unlikely event that it waives its sovereign immunity. As for the State courts, there is little chance of success with infringement-type a actions for patents and copyrights because of Federal judicial preemption and an absence of State-recognized causes of action. Furthermore, even if infringement suits can be brought in State court, it may not be possible to bring them against States that have governmental immunity shielding them from suit in their own courts.  What I have just described is a series of dead ends for intellectual property owners. That is why the two Federal agencies with expertise in intellectual property matters, the U.S. Copyright Office and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, have expressed their support for corrective legislation by Congress. As the Copyrights Office told the GAO, ``Only in this way can the proper balance, and basic fairness, be restored.''  I hope we can all agree on the need for congressional action on this issue. We need to assure American inventors and investors, and our foreign trading partners, that as State involvement in intellectual property becomes ever greater in the new information economy, U.S. intellectual property rights are backed by legal remedies.  This is important as a matter of economics: Our national economy depends on real and effective intellectual property rights. It is also important as a matter of justice: In conceding that the States are constitutionally bound to respect Federal intellectual property rights but invalidating the remedies Congress has created to enforce those rights, the Court has jeopardized one of the basic principles that distinguishes our Constitution from the constitution of the old Soviet Union, the principle that where there is a right, there must also be a remedy.  It is also important as a matter of foreign relations: American trading interests have been well served by our strong and consistent advocacy of effective intellectual property protections in treaty negotiations and other international fora, and those efforts could be jeopardized by the loophole in U.S. intellectual property enforcement that the Supreme Court has created.  Like most of the constitutional experts who have examined the issue, I have no doubt that several constitutional mechanisms remain open to Congress to restore substantial protection for patents, copyrights and trademarks. The Supreme Court's hypertechnical constitutional interpretations require us to jump through some technical hoops of our own, but that the exercise is now not merely worthwhile, but essential to safeguard both U.S. prosperity and the continued authority of Congress.  My bill is based on a simple premise: That there is no inherent, ``natural law'' entitlement to Federal intellectual property rights and remedies. In discussing the policies underlying the intellectual property laws, the Supreme Court has emphasized that intellectual property is not a right but a privilege, and that it is conditioned by a public purpose. For example, the Court wrote in Mercoid Corp. versus Mid-Continent Invest Co., a 1944 case, that ``The grant of a patent is the grant of a special privilege `to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts,' '' and that ``It is the public interest which is dominant in the patent system.'' Similarly, in discussing the copyright laws in Fogerty versus Fantasy, Inc, the Court underscored that ``the monopoly privileges that Congress has authorized, while intended to motivate the creative activity of authors and inventors by the provision of a special reward, are limited in nature and must ultimately serve the public good.''  The Constitution empowers but does not require Congress to make intellectual property rights and remedies available, and Congress should do so in a manner that encourages and protects innovation in the public and private sector alike.  States and their institutions, especially State Universities, benefit hugely from the Federal intellectual property laws. All 50 States own or have obtained patents, some hold many hundreds of patents. States also hold other intellectual property rights secured by Federal law, and the trend is toward increased participation by the States in commerce involving intellectual property.  Principles of State sovereignty tell us that States and their instrumentalities are entitled to a free and informed choice of whether or not to participate in the Federal intellectual property system, subject only to their constitutional obligations.  Equity and common sense tell us that one who chooses to enjoy the benefits of a law, whether it be a Federal research grant or the multimillion-dollar benefits of Federal intellectual property protections, should also bear its burdens.  Sound economics and traditional notions of federalism tell us that it is appropriate for the Federal Government to assist and encourage the sovereign States in their sponsorship of whatever innovation and creation they freely choose to sponsor by giving them intellectual property protection and, on occasion, funding, so long as the States hold up their end of the bargain by honoring the exclusive rights of other intellectual property owners.  The IPPRA builds on these principles. In order to promote cooperative federalism in the intellectual property arena, it provides reasonable incentives for states to waive their immunity in intellectual property cases and participate in our national intellectual property project on equal terms with private parties. States that choose not to waive their immunity within 2 years after enactment of the IPPRA would continue to enjoy many of the benefits of the Federal intellectual property system; however, like private parties that sue non-waiving states for infringement, nonwaiving States that sue private parties for infringement could not recover any money damages that would otherwise be available under Federal law. That is because Federal intellectual property that has been owned by a nonwaiving State would be short one ``stick'' from the usual bundle of rights accorded by Federal law: The ability to sue for damages under Federal law when the intellectual property has been infringed.  This scheme is plainly authorized by the letter of the Constitution. Article I empowers Congress to ``promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.'' Incident to this power, Congress may attach conditions on the receipt of exclusive intellectual property rights. Indeed, we have always attached certain conditions, such as the requirement of public disclosure of an invention at the Patent and Trademark Office in order to obtain a patent.  My proposal is also consistent with the spirit of federalism, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, because it gives State entities a free, informed and meaningful choice to waive or not to waive immunity at any time. The condition imposed on receipt of federal benefits by the IPPRA, submitting to suit under laws that are already binding on the States, is not onerous, nor does it co-opt any state resources to the service of Federal policy. It simply levels the intellectual property playing field.  Congress may attach conditions on a State's receipt of Federal intellectual property protection under its Article I intellectual property power just as Congress may attach conditions on a State's receipt of Federal funds under its Article I spending power. Either way, the power to attach conditions to the Federal benefit is an integral part of the greater power to deny the benefit altogether. Either way, the State has a choice, to forgo the Federal benefit and exercise its sovereign power however it wishes subject to the Constitution, or to take the benefit and exercise its sovereign power in the manner requested by Congress.  Three Federal appeals courts have applied similar reasoning in connection with the 1996 Telecommunications Act. The Courts of Appeals for the Fifth, Seventh, Tenth Circuits have reasoned that, because Congress was under no obligation to allow States to participate in the regulatory scheme established by the 1996 Act, Congress could validly condition a state commission's decision to exercise regulatory authority under the Act on its waiving sovereign immunity.  This seems like plain common sense to me. It would be a truly bizarre reading of the Constitution to say that it is up to Congress whether or not to let States participate in telecom regulation or in the intellectual property regime, but that if we choose to let them participate, we cannot hold them accountable for their actions.  Given the choice between opting in to the intellectual property laws and forging some intellectual property protection under the Federal laws, States and their institutions will, I hope, choose to opt in. The benefit--being able to recover damages for an infringement--is significant, while the burden--consenting to be sued for future State infringements--is slight. Most States already respect intellectual property rights and will seldom find themselves in infringement suits.  However, some State entities and officials have violated intellectual property rights in the past, and the massive growth of both intellectual property and state participation in the intellectual property marketplace that we are seeing in the new economy give ample cause for concern that such violations will continue. Now that the Supreme Court has seemingly given the States carte blanche to violate intellectual property rights free from any adverse financial consequences so long as they stand on their newly augmented sovereign immunity, the prospect of States violating Federal law and then asserting immunity is too serious to ignore.  The IPPRA therefore also provides for the limited set of remedies that the Supreme Court's new jurisprudence leaves available to Congress to enforce a nonwaiving State's obligations under Federal law and the United States Constitution. The key point here is that, while the Court struck down our prior effort to enforce the intellectual property laws themselves by authorizing actions for damages against the states, it nonetheless acknowledged Congress' power to authorize actions for injunctions and actions to enforce constitutional rights related to intellectual property.  First, for the avoidance of doubt, the IPPRA ensures the full availability of prospective equitable relief to prevent States from violating or exceeding their rights under Federal intellectual property laws. As the Supreme Court expressly acknowledged in its Seminole Tribe decision in 1996, such relief is available, notwithstanding any assertion of State sovereign immunity, under what is generally known as the doctrine of Ex parte Young.  Second, to address the harm done to the rights of intellectual property owners before they can secure an injunction, the IPPRA also provides a damages remedy to the full extent of Congress' power to enforce the constitutional rights of intellectual property owners. Under the Supreme Court's recent decisions, this remedy is necessarily limited to the redress of constitutional violations, not violations ofthe Federal intellectual property laws themselves. However, the Supreme Court has reaffirmed on may occasions that the intellectual property owner's right of exclusion is a property right fully protected from governmental violation under the Fifth amendment's takings clause and under the 14th amendment's due process clause.  The constitutional remedy provided by the IPPRA closely resembles the remedy that Congress provided decades ago for deprivations of Federal rights by persons acting under color of State law. The bill does not expand the property rights secured by the Federal intellectual property laws--these laws are already binding on the States' nor does the bill interfere with any governmental authority to regulate businesses that own such rights. It simply restores the ability of private persons to enforce such rights against the States.  I view this bill as an exercise in cooperative federalism. Clear, certain, and uniform national rules protecting Federal intellectual property rights benefit everyone: Consumers, businesses, the Federal Government and the States. The IPPRA preserves States' rights, and gives States a free choice. At the same time, it ensures effective protection for individual constitutional rights closing the loophole created by the Supreme Court of Federal rights unsupported by effective remedies. We unanimously passed more sweeping legislation in the early 1990s, but were thwarted by Supreme Court's shifting jurisprudence. The IPPRA is designed to restore the benefits we sought to provide intellectual property owners while meeting the Court's new jurisprudential requirements.  There are to be sure, other approaches that Congress could take to address the problems created by the Court's decisions. In consultation with experts in intellectual property law and constitutional law, I reviewed several alternatives before settling on the IPPRA's approach. In the end, I concluded that the approach I have outlined is the best way to achieve a solution that meets any constitutional concerns, fosters State-Federal cooperation, and encourages American innovation and creativity to providing certain and effective intellectual property protection.  when I first introduced the IPPRA in 1999, it prompted a flurry of constructive comments and suggestions on how the legislation could be improved. I look forward to considering further refinements to the bill as the legislative process moves forward.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a section-by-section summary of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1611       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

The      Court's decisions give states an unfair advantage in the      intellectual property marketplace by shielding them from      money damages when they infringe the rights of private      parties, while leaving them free to obtain money damages when      their own rights are infringed. These decisions also have the      potential to impair the rights of private intellectual      property owners, discourage technological innovation and      artistic creation, and compromise the ability of the United      States to fulfill its obligations under a variety of      international treaties. The Intellectual Property Protection      Restoration Act of 2001 creates reasonable incentives for      states to waive their immunity in intellectual property cases      and participate in the intellectual property marketplace on      equal terms with private parties. The bill also provides new      remedies for state infringements that rise to the level of      constitutional violations.       Sec. 1. Short title; references.--This Act may be cited as      the ``Intellectual Property Protection Restoration Act of      2001.       Sec. 2. Purposes.--Legislative purposes in support of this      Act.       Sec. 3. Intellectual property remedies equalization.--     Places states on an equal footing with private parties by      eliminating any damages remedy for infringement of state-     owned intellectual property unless the state has waived its      immunity from any damages remedy for infringement of      privately-owned intellectual property. Intellectual property      that the state owned before the enactment of this Act is not      affected.       Sec. 4. Clarification of remedies available for statutory      violations by state officers and employees.--Affirms the      availability of injunctive relief against state officials who      violate the federal intellectual property laws. Such relief      is authorized under the doctrine of Ex parte Young, 209 U.S.      123 (1908), which held that an individual may sue a state      official for prospective relief requiring the state official      to cease violating federal law, even if the state itself is      immune from suit under the eleventh amendment. This section      also affirms that state officials may be personally liable      for violations of the intellectual property laws.       Sec. 5. Liability of states for constitutional violations      involving intellectual property.--Establishes a right to      compensation for state infringements of intellectual property      that rise to the level of constitutional violations.      Compensation shall be measured by the statutory remedies      available under the federal intellectual property laws, but      may not include treble damages.       Sec. 6. Rules of construction.--Establishes rules for      interpreting this Act.                                 ______                                       By
