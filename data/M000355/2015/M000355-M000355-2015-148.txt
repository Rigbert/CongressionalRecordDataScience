 Nearly every day seems to bring more signs that we are. Over the weekend, President Obama signed the FAST Act, a multiyear highway bill, into law. It represents a significant departure from years of short-term extensions and congressional inaction. In fact, the FAST Act is the longest term highway bill to pass Congress in almost two decades, providing 5 full years of highway funding.  Here is what Kentuckians for Better Transportation--a top transportation advocacy organization in my State--had to say about it:       After many, many years of short term continuing resolutions      we finally have a long term authorization that will give our      states the opportunity to plan for and implement major road      projects. . . . We can [now] plan for the future.  That is because in a new and more open Senate, Senator Inhofe, a Republican, and Senator Boxer, a Democrat, were able to work together for its passage. Senator Boxer herself called it ``a major accomplishment.''  Here is another major accomplishment: the Every Student Succeeds Act. It is a bipartisan, reformist replacement for No Child Left Behind. Pundits in Washington could never agree on how to replace No Child Left Behind. The issue went unresolved for many years, but in a new and more open Senate, Senator Alexander, a Republican, and Senator Murray, a Democrat, worked hard and found success in the bill before us. The House already passed it, 359 to 64. The Senate previously passed a very similar version of the bill, 81 to 17.  Tomorrow we should work together to pass it for a second and final time and send it to the President for his signature. It will be the latest important achievement for the American people from a new Congress that is back to work and back on their side.  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
