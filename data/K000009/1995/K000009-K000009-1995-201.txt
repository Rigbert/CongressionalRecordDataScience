Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for yielding time to me, Mr. Speaker, I also thank the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Leach] and I rise in strong support of House Resolution 80, our resolution of inquiry to investigate the $52 billion Mexican rescue package.  Members of Congress should not have had to fight this hard nor wait this long to achieve this first vote on a matter of such profound economic and political consequence to our people and to our continent.  Having gotten this far, Mr. Speaker, despite fierce opposition from the leadership of this House and the administration is a clear initial victory for the American people and our tax-paying public over powerful, monied interests who would wish to muzzle our voices.  I will be entering in the Record an article that appeared in the Washington Post today on page C-1, in confirmation of what I am saying.  Today's vote will be a victory for every working family that obeys the laws, pays the taxes, and fights the wars. Today's vote should signal a political change to those powerful special interests that have for too long written the rules of banking and trade, who have given away our jobs, and then had to call on our U.S. Treasury to bail out their mistakes.  Let me remind my colleagues, this is a first vote. We must continue our efforts and pass other bills strictly proscribing the authority of the executive branch over the Exchange Stabilization Fund, so that it can no longer be used as an unauthorized form of back door foreign aid.  I am proud that this House and this Committee on Banking and Financial Services will go on record today as the first branch to begin doing its job. The recent action by the U.S. Treasury is absolutely unprecedented in both magnitude and duration. It is 20 times larger than the largest prior use of this particular fund.  Never has it been the will of Congress to provide the Executive Branch with unlimited authority of this sort. In the past, we have used the fund for intervention in exchange markets and for very short-term loans, usually bridged to a guaranteed repayment in hard currency.  No amount of United States taxpayer money will solve Mexico's problems, which are rooted in deep-seated political corruption, as today's papers remind us, the lack of rule of law, and mismanaged economic programs for decades.                              {time}  1815  Thus Congress through this resolution must demand answers for our people to questions like, what is the full extend of United States taxpayers' exposure to the deepening crisis in Mexico?  Since Mexico owes nearly $200 billion, how deep can the United States promise extend?  Which United States creditors will benefit from the rescue package with which Mexico still holds outstanding debts?  [[Page H2448]] How solid is Mexico's oil pledge as collateral and how solvent is Pemex?  Will there be new U.S. appropriations required to the IMF and the Bank for International Settlements?  The American people have a right to know how their money is being risked and spent. Nothing is more important than the integrity of our Constitution, the prerogatives of this House which protect the interests of all Americans rather than the rich and powerful few.  Let me say there, four men do not make a House of Representatives.  If this rescue package is as necessary as we are being told it is, then we deserve to have our questions answered.  As economist Jeff Faux reminds us, there have been other moments in our history when Washington's best and brightest led the Nation step by step into a disaster. Remember the Vietnam war, when we were assured at each stage of the escalation that the new expansion would solve the problem?  With Mexico first came the Brady debt buyout plan, then came NAFTA, now comes the bailout.  As with Vietnam, we have a domino theory. If the peso is not propped up, investor confidence will collapse throughout the world, throughout Latin America.  As in Vietnam, commonsense questions go unanswered. If the loan is so secure, why are private banks not willing to put up the money?  As in Vietnam, the mistakes of elites are being paid for by the ordinary people of both countries, lost jobs, lost incomes, lost hopes, lost business.  And as with Vietnam, we have had to fight a war in this Chamber to even get this vote.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this resolution requesting the executive branch to provide the House not later than 14 days after the adoption of this resolution the information we are seeking.  We must work the will of the people here today. Vote ``yes'' on House Resolution 80.  Mr. Speaker, I include the following for the Record:               [From the Washington Post, March 1, 1995]                   Fund Used for Peso Faces Scrutiny                           (By Clay Chandler)       When Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Federal Reserve      Board Chairman Alan Greenspan went to Congress in January      asking approval for a $40 billion, U.S.-led bailout for      Mexico, several Republican lawmakers offered what they      thought was a better idea: Rather than risk a messy political      brawl, why not tap the Exchange Stabilization Fund, a little-     known Treasury Department reserve over which Rubin had almost      sole control?       At a late-afternoon meeting in the office of House Speaker      Newt Gingrich (R-Ga), Rubin, Greenspan, and Treasury      Undersecretary Lawrence H. Summers dismissed the suggestion      as impossible, participants recall.       But three weeks later, with its bailout proposal mired on      Capitol Hill and the Mexican government hurtling toward      bankruptcy, the administration abruptly changed its view.       On Jan. 31, President Clinton announced he was extending      the Mexican government an unprecedented $20 billion in loans      and loan guarantees--some of them for as long as 10 years--by      drawing on the very Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) Rubin      had said could not be used.       Now lawmakers are calling for hearings over whether the      administration's use of the obscure Treasury fund violates      the law. The Exchange Stabilization Fund ``is not the      president's personal piggy bank,'' Senate Banking Committee      Chairman Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.) thundered in a Senate      speech last week.       On that January afternoon and in subsequent discussions,      Rubin, Greenspan and Summers argued that using the fund would      stretch the limits of the law and precedent, participants      recall. The fund's primary purpose, they said, was for short-     term currency transactions to bolster the dollar--not to      rescue cash-strapped foreign governments. In any case, they      calculated the $25 billion fund was too small to address      Mexico's problem by itself.       But as events unfolded, administration officials      reconsidered. A last-minute $18 billion offer from the      International Monetary Fund, along with the money in the ESF,      provided the credit administration officials deemed necessary      to stabilize the peso.       ``They needed a way out . . .'' a House Republican involved      in the discussions said of the change: ``They obviously      looked at the ESF at the outset and said, `There's no way.'      But when pressed, they went back and said, `We haven't been      sufficiently creative in our interpretation of the law.'''       The night before Clinton announced the new rescue plan,      Gingrich, House Banking Committee Chairman Jim Leach (R-     Iowa), Senate Majority Whip Trent Lott (R-Miss.) and Sen.      Robert F. Bennett (R-Utah) met and agreed that the      administration's bailout plan was in deep trouble. One of the      lawmakers telephoned Rubin and raised use of the fund again,      according to Treasury and congressional sources.       Rubin said Greenspan and others had advised him it would be      politically unwise to tap the fund without congressional      approval. ``What if I told you that no one in Congress is      going to complain?'' the lawmaker asked.       ``That would change things entirely,'' Rubin replied, the      sources said.       But now, members of Congress are complaining. D'Amato has      vowed to make the fund's legal status a focus of hearings      later this month.       Last night, a Treasury Department official lamented that      ``many members of Congress are now criticizing us for what      [other] members asked us to do'' earlier.       Most of the past fund loans to foreign governments have      been for less than $1 billion. The 1934 law establishing the      fund restricts loans to foreign governments to six months      unless the president ``gives Congress a written statement      that unique or emergency circumstances require the loan or      credit be for more than six months.''       Clinton has deemed the Mexican case an emergency, arguing      the Latin nation has broad commercial and social links to the      United States and a Mexican default might have triggered a      global financial meltdown.       Many legal experts doubt opponents could overturn the      administration's decision to lend ESF money to Mexico on      strictly legal grounds. The fund is ``under the exclusive      control of the secretary,'' the statute states, adding,      ``decisions of the secretary are final and may not be      reviewed by another officer or employee of the government.''       That is not likely to silence congressional critics.      D'Amato is likely to use hearings to question whether the      funds for Mexico are really foreign aid--a use expressly      prohibited by law.       In a 14-page brief to D'Amato's committee, Treasury      Department General Counsel Edward S. Knight said, ``Treasury      has taken steps to assure that there is a source of      repayment'' of the Mexican loans. But the lending agreement      Rubin signed with Mexico's government last week describes the      Mexican oil proceeds that secure the U.S. loans as ``assured      sources of repayment'' rather than collateral--an artful turn      of phrase opponents say reflects the shakiness of U.S. claims      on Mexico should the country fail to repay its debts.       Last week, Senate Majority Leader Robert J. Dole (R-Kan.),      who initially endorsed the use of the ESF, expressed concern      about using the fund to prop up the Mexican banking system.      ``The Treasury Department needs to be very careful in the use      of funds from the Exchange Stabilization Fund,'' Dole said in      a statement. ``I am not convinced that thrusting the United      States into the middle of a Mexican banking crisis is prudent      or necessary.''
