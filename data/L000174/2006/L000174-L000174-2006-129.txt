President, I commend the two leaders for trying to work out these issues. Over the years, I have seen leaders try to do it at the end of a session. I don't consider myself a Charles Atlas, but I do consider myself a U.S. Senator. I have taken an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States.  Some of us have sat in this Chamber and in committee for 5 years while what was being done in detaining the prisoners violated our Constitution and our traditions in the United States. Seven of the nine Members of the Supreme Court are Republicans, incidentally, and have said the same thing in the Hamdan decision.  We tried for 5 years to get the administration to listen to us, to tell us there are ways we could have worked this out so the United States would follow its own laws, would follow its own Constitution, would follow the ideals on which this country was founded, and give that kind of example, a shining light to the rest of the world. And now suddenly the administration, after meeting behind closed doors, predominantly just with the Republicans, says: Here, in 2 hours' time, we have a solution; accept it. I have some problems with that. I will discuss this with the leaders.  As I said, I don't stand here as Charles Atlas, but I stand here as a U.S. Senator with my rights and to protect the rights of Americans.
