President, I would like to pay tribute to one of Vermont's outstanding teachers, Diane Bahrenburg, who last month was named the 2008 Vermont Teacher of the Year. Diane is an English teacher at Colchester High School in Vermont, where she has taught since 1979. I recently had the opportunity to meet Diane in my Washington office, and I was impressed with her intellect, her passion for teaching, and her commitment to the students of Colchester High School. As we talked about her classes and students, it was evident how much Diane cares about teaching.  In being chosen as Vermont's Teacher of the Year, Diane will have the opportunity to visit schools throughout our State and others around the country. Her travels will allow her to work with other teachers, sharing and discussing the methods that have helped her become so successful. Hopefully she will share with all of us how she has been able to balance the everyday demands of teaching in the classroom, with the work she has done as an adjunct instructor at Johnson State College and UVM, acting as the Vermont debate-forensics lead coach at Colchester High School, and being a parent.  We all know that teaching is a hard job. And it is a crucial job an indispensable link between our young people and their futures, as well as our Nation's future. The opportunities for recognition of teachers' accomplishments are too few and too far between. So I am so pleased that Diane is being recognized for all she has done over three decades, day in and day out, to educate our children and to make a constructive difference, one child at a time. Teachers are the instrument by which we measure the success of our schools. The knowledge, skill, and experience of teachers like Diane are exactly what we need in each and every one of our classrooms.  We are fortunate in Vermont. I continue to be impressed by the high level of achievement of Vermont's students and the academic gains that have been made because of the strong and committed efforts of teachers like Diane. In spite of the countless hours spent sorting through the maze of No Child Left Behind requirements, our teachers are able to inspire students to look beyond tests and find the true lessons of the classroom.  As an alumnus of St. Michael's College in Vermont, I would be remiss if I failed to note that Diane received her master's in education degree from St. Michael's College in 2000. I believe that she embodies the core principles of the college's education programs with her skill in maintaining an inclusive classroom, while keeping a balance between challenge and support and between individual and community. Diane is a model teacher, and after decades of teaching, she is incredibly worthy of this recognition. Diane, again I say thank you for all that you do, and on behalf of the Senate, we say congratulations.                          ____________________
