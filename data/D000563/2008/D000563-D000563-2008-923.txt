President, I say to the Senator from North Dakota, this is a critically important bill for a lot of very vulnerable people, Native Americans, who have not been treated well throughout our history. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his leadership in trying to bring this bill to the floor. But could I ask the Senator from North Dakota, how many days have we been on the bill on the floor of the Senate?
