President, the Udall-Webb-Leahy-Feinstein-Durbin-Paul-Wyden amendment would remove the very troubling detention subtitle from the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012. I am a cosponsor of this amendment because I believe the detention subtitle is deeply flawed. We should hear from the Pentagon and other agencies about what they believe to be the appropriate role of the Armed Forces in detaining and prosecuting terrorism suspects. Unfortunately, the language in the bill before us blatantly disregards the concerns of these agencies.  Contrary to statements by the bill's authors, the current version of the detention subtitle, considered by the Senate Armed Services Committee, SASCon November 15, contains virtually all of the same concerns as the earlier version of the bill. The changes made by SASC do not correct the problems that have been raised by the administration.  Since the SASC marked up the new version, we have received several letters from the administration in opposition to the new language. Secretary Panetta, Director of National Intelligence Clapper, and FBI Director Mueller, have all written to Senate leaders in opposition of the language. That means this language is opposed by each of the agencies whose officers in the field will be directly affected by it.  Just yesterday, Director Mueller wrote that the ``legislation introduces a substantial element of uncertainty'' into terrorism investigations. Secretary Panetta wrote that the legislation ``may needlessly complicate efforts by frontline law enforcement professionals to collect critical intelligence.'' Director Clapper wrote that ``the various detention provisions . . . would introduce unnecessary rigidity'' into investigations. And we have a Statement of Administration Policy raising very strong objections to some of these provisions. I ask unanimous consent to place these letters and the Statement of Administration Policy in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         The Secretary of Defense,                                             Defense Pentagon,                                    Washington, DC, Nov. 15, 2011.     The Hon. Carl Levin,     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write to express the Department of      Defense's principal concerns with the latest version of      detainee-related language you are considering including in      the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year      2012. We understand the Senate Armed Services Committee is      planning to consider this language later today.       We greatly appreciate your willingness to listen to the      concerns expressed by our national security professionals on      the version of the NDAA bill reported by the Senate Armed      Services Committee in June. I am convinced we all want the      same result--flexibility for our national security      professionals in the field to detain, interrogate, and      prosecute suspected terrorists. The Department has      substantial concerns, however, about the revised text, which      my staff has just received within the last few hours.       Section 1032. We recognize your efforts to address some of      our objections to section 1032. However, it continues to be      the case that any advantages to the Department of Defense in      particular and our national security in general in section      1032 of requiring that certain individuals be held by the      military are, at best, unclear. This provision restrains the      Executive Branch's options to utilize, in a swift and      flexible fashion, all the counterterrorism tools that are now      legally available.       Moreover, the failure of the revised text to clarify that      section 1032 applies to individuals captured abroad, as we      have urged, may needlessly complicate efforts by frontline      law enforcement professionals to collect critical      intelligence concerning operations and activities within the      United States.       Next, the revised language adds a new qualifier to      ``associated force''--``that acts in coordination with or      pursuant to the direction of al-Qaeda.'' In our view, this      new language unnecessarily complicates our ability to      interpret and implement this section.       Further, the new version of section 1032 makes it more      apparent that there is an intent to extend the certification      requirements of section 1033 to those covered by section 1032      that we may want to transfer to a third country. In other      words, the certification requirement that currently applies      only to Guantanamo detainees would permanently extend to a      whole new category of future captures. This imposes a whole      new restraint on the flexibility we need to continue to      pursue our counterterrorism efforts.       Section 1033. We are troubled that section 1033 remains      essentially unchanged from the prior draft, and that none of      the Administration's concerns or suggestions for this      provision have been adopted. We appreciate that revised      section 1033 removes language that would have made these      restrictions permanent, and instead extended them through      Fiscal Year 2012 only. As a practical matter, however,      limiting the duration of the restrictions to the next fiscal      year only will have little impact if Congress simply      continues to insert these restrictions into legislation on an      annual basis without ever revisiting the substance of the      legislation. As national security officials in this      Department and elsewhere have explained, transfer      restrictions such as those outlined in section 1033 are      largely unworkable and pose unnecessary obstacles to      transfers that would advance our national security interests.       Section 1035. Finally, section 1035 shifts to the      Department of Defense responsibility for what has previously      been a consensus-driven interagency process that was informed      by the advice and views of counterterrorism professionals      from across the Government. We see no compelling reason--and      certainly none has been expressed in our discussions to      date--to upset a collaborative, interagency approach that has      served our national security so well over the past few years.       I hope we can reach agreement on these important national      security issues, and, as always, my staff is available to      work with the Committee on these and other matters.           Sincerely,     Leon E. Panetta.                                  ____                                                       Director of                                        National Intelligence,                                                   Washington, DC.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Madam Chairman: I am writing in response to your      letter requesting my views on the effect that the detention      provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act for      Fiscal Year 2012 could have on the ability of the      Intelligence Community to gather counterterrorism      information. In my view, some of these provisions could limit      the effectiveness of our intelligence and law enforcement      professionals at a time when we need the utmost flexibility      to defend the nation from terrorist threats. The Executive      Branch should have maximum flexibility in these areas,      consistent with our law and values, rather than face      limitations on our options to acquire intelligence      information. As stated in the November 17, 2011, Statement of      Administration Policy for S. 1867, ``[a]ny bill that      challenges or constrains the President's critical authorities      to collect intelligence, incapacitate dangerous terrorists,      and protect the nation would prompt the President's senior      advisers to recommend a veto.''       Our principal objective upon the capture of a potential      terrorist is to obtain intelligence information and to      prevent future attacks, yet the provision that mandates      military custody for a certain class of terrorism suspects      could restrict the ability of our nation's intelligence      professionals to acquire valuable intelligence and prevent      future terrorist attacks. The best method for securing vital      intelligence from suspected terrorists varies depending on      the facts and circumstances of each case. In the years since      September 11, 2001, the Intelligence Community has worked      successfully with our military and law enforcement partners      to gather vital intelligence in a wide variety of      circumstances at home and abroad and I am concerned that some      of these provisions will make it more difficult to continue      to have these successes in the future.       Taken together, the various detention provisions, even with      the proposed waivers, would introduce unnecessary rigidity at      a time when our intelligence, military, and law enforcement      professionals are working more closely than ever to defend      our nation effectively and quickly from terrorist attacks.      These limitations could deny our nation the ability to      respond flexibly and appropriately to unfolding events--     including the capture of terrorism suspects--and restrict a      process that currently encourages intelligence collection      through the preservation of all lawful avenues of detention      and interrogation.       Our intelligence professionals are best served when they      have the greatest flexibility to collect intelligence from      suspected terrorists. I am concerned that the detention      provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act could      reduce this flexibility.           Sincerely,     James R. Clapper.                                  ____                                       U.S. Department of Justice,                              Federal Bureau of Investigation,                                Washington, DC, November 28, 2011.     Hon. Carl Levin,     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to express concerns      regarding the impact of certain aspects of the current      version of Section 1032 of the National Defense Authorization      Act for Fiscal Year 2012. Because the proposed legislation      applies to certain persons detained in the United States, the      legislation may adversely impact our ability to continue      ongoing international terrorism investigations before or      after arrest, derive intelligence from those investigations,      and may raise extraneous issues in any future prosecution of      a person covered by Section 1032.       The legislation as currently proposed raises two principal      concerns. First, by establishing a presumption of military      detention for covered individuals within the United States,      the legislation introduces a substantial element of      uncertainty as to what procedures are to be followed in the      course of a terrorism investigation in the United States.      Even before the decision to arrest is made, the question of      whether a Secretary of Defense waiver is necessary for the      investigation to proceed will inject uncertainty as to the      appropriate course for further investigation up to and beyond      the moment when the determination is made that there is      probable cause for an arrest.       Section 1032 may be read to divest the FBI and other      domestic law enforcement agencies of jurisdiction to continue      to investigate those persons who are known to fall within the      mandatory strictures of section 1032, absent the Secretary's      waiver. The legislation may call into question the FBI's      continued use or scope of its criminal investigative or      national security authorities in     further investigation of the subject. The legislation may      restrict the FBI from using the grand jury to gather records      relating to the covered person's communication or financial      records, or to subpoena witnesses having information on the      matter. Absent a statutory basis for further domestic      investigation, Section 1032 may be interpreted by the courts      as foreclosing the FBI from conducting any further      investigation of the covered individual or his associates.       Second, the legislation as currently drafted will inhibit      our ability to convince covered arrestees to cooperate      immediately, and provide critical intelligence. The      legislation introduces a substantial element of uncertainty      as to what procedures are to be followed at perhaps the most      critical time in the development of an investigation against      a covered person. Over the past decade we have had numerous      arrestees, several of whom would arguably have been covered      by the statute, who have provided important intelligence      immediately after they have been arrested, and in some      instances for days and weeks thereafter. In the context of      the arrest, they have been persuaded that it was in their      best interests to provide essential information while the      information was current and useful to the arresting      authorities.       Nonetheless, at this crucial juncture, in order for the      arresting agents to proceed to obtain the desired      cooperation, the statute requires that a waiver be obtained      from the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the      Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence,      with certification by the Secretary to Congress that the      waiver was in the national security interests of the United      States. The proposed statute acknowledges that this is a      significant point in an ongoing investigation. It provides      that surveillance and intelligence gathering on the      arrestee's associates should not be interrupted. Likewise,      the statute provides that an ongoing interrogation session      should not be interrupted.       These limited exceptions, however, fail to recognize the      reality of a counterterrorism investigation. Building rapport      with, and convincing a covered individual to cooperate once      arrested, is a delicate and time sensitive skill that      transcends any one interrogation session. It requires      coordination with other aspects of the investigation.      Coordination with the prosecutor's office is also often an      essential component of obtaining a defendant's cooperation.      To halt this process while the Secretary of Defense      undertakes the mandated consultation, and the required.      certification is drafted and provided to Congress, would set      back our efforts to develop intelligence from the subject.       We appreciate that Congress has sought to address our      concerns in the latest version of the bill, but believe that      the legislation as currently drafted remains problematic for      the reasons set forth above. We respectfully ask that you      take into account these concerns as Congress continues to      consider Section 1032.           Sincerely,                                            Robert S. Mueller III,     Director.                                  ____                   Statement of Administration Policy        S. 1867--National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2012                   (Sen. Levin, D-MI, Nov. 17, 2011)       The Administration supports Senate passage of S. 1867, the      National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year (FY) 2012.      The Administration appreciates the Senate Armed Services      Committee's continued support of our national defense,      including its support for both the base budget and for      overseas contingency operations and for most of the      Administration's initiatives to control spiraling health      costs of the Department of Defense (DoD).       The Administration appreciates the support of the Committee      for authorities that assist the ability of the warfighter to      operate in unconventional and irregular warfare, authorities      that are important to field commanders, such as the      Commanders' Emergency Response Program, Global Train and      Equip Authority, and other programs that provide commanders      with the resources and flexibility to counter unconventional      threats or support contingency or stability operations. The      Administration looks forward to reviewing a classified annex      and working with the Congress to address any concerns on      classified programs as the legislative process moves forward.       While there are many areas of agreement with the Committee,      the Administration would have serious concerns with      provisions that would: (1) constrain the ability of the Armed      Forces to carry out their missions; (2) impede the Secretary      of Defense's ability to make and implement decisions that      eliminate unnecessary overhead or programs to ensure scarce      resources are directed to the highest priorities for the      warfighter; or (3) depart from the decisions reflected in the      President's FY 2012 Budget Request. The Administration looks      forward to working with the Congress to address these and      other concerns, a number of which are outlined in more detail      below.       Detainee Matters: The Administration objects to and has      serious legal and policy concerns about many of the detainee      provisions in the bill. In their current form, some of these      provisions disrupt the Executive branch's ability to enforce      the law and impose unwise and unwarranted restrictions on the      U.S. Government's ability to aggressively combat      international terrorism; other provisions inject legal      uncertainty and ambiguity that may only complicate the      military's operations and detention practices.       Section 1031 attempts to expressly codify the detention      authority that exists under the Authorization for Use of      Military Force (Public Law 107-40) (the ``AUMF''). The      authorities granted by the AUMF, including the detention      authority, are essential to our ability to protect the      American people from the threat posed by al-Qa'ida and its      associated forces, and have enabled us to confront the full      range of threats this country faces from those organizations      and individuals. Because the authorities codified in this      section already exist, the Administration does not believe      codification is necessary and poses some risk. After a decade      of settled jurisprudence on detention authority, Congress      must be careful not to open a whole new series of legal      questions that will distract from our efforts to protect the      country. While the current language minimizes many of those      risks, future legislative action must ensure that the      codification in statute of express military detention      authority does not carry unintended consequences that could      compromise our ability to protect the American people.       The Administration strongly objects to the military custody      provision of section 1032, which would appear to mandate      military custody for a certain class of terrorism suspects.      This unnecessary, untested, and legally controversial      restriction of the President's authority to defend the Nation      from terrorist threats would tie the hands of our      intelligence and law enforcement professionals. Moreover,      applying this military custody requirement to individuals      inside the United States, as some Members of Congress have      suggested is their intention, would raise serious and      unsettled legal questions and would be inconsistent with the      fundamental American principle that our military does not      patrol our streets. We have spent ten years since September      11, 2001, breaking down the walls between intelligence,      military, and law enforcement professionals; Congress should      not now rebuild those walls and unnecessarily make the job of      preventing terrorist attacks more difficult. Specifically,      the provision would limit the flexibility of our national      security professionals to choose, based on the evidence and      the facts and circumstances of each case, which tool for      incapacitating dangerous terrorists best serves our national      security interests. The waiver provision fails to address      these concerns, particularly in time-sensitive operations in      which law enforcement personnel have traditionally played the      leading role. These problems are all the more acute because      the section defines the category of individuals who would be      subject to mandatory military custody by substituting new and      untested legislative criteria for the criteria the Executive      and Judicial branches are currently using for detention under      the AUMF in both habeas litigation and military operations.      Such confusion threatens our ability to act swiftly and      decisively to capture, detain, and interrogate terrorism      suspects, and could disrupt the collection of vital      intelligence about threats to the American people.       Rather than fix the fundamental defects of section 1032 or      remove it entirely, as the Administration and the chairs of      several congressional committees with jurisdiction over these      matters have advocated, the revised text merely directs the      President to develop procedures to ensure the myriad problems      that would result from such a requirement do not come to      fruition. Requiring the President to devise such procedures      concedes the substantial risks created by mandating military      custody, without providing an adequate solution. As a result,      it is likely that implementing such procedures would inject      significant confusion into counterterrorism operations.       The certification and waiver, required by section 1033      before a detainee may be transferred from Guantanamo Bay to a      foreign country, continue to hinder the Executive branch's      ability to exercise its military, national security, and      foreign relations activities. While these provisions may be      intended to be somewhat less restrictive than the analogous      provisions in current law, they continue to pose unnecessary      obstacles, effectively blocking transfers that would advance      our national security interests, and would, in certain      circumstances, violate constitutional separation of powers      principles. The Executive branch must have the flexibility to      act swiftly in conducting negotiations with foreign countries      regarding the circumstances of detainee transfers. Section      1034's ban on the use of funds to construct or modify a      detention facility in the United States is an unwise      intrusion on the military's ability to transfer its detainees      as operational needs dictate. Section 1035 conflicts with the      consensus-based interagency approach to detainee reviews      required under Executive Order No. 13567, which establishes      procedures to ensure that periodic review decisions are      informed by the most comprehensive information and the      considered views of all relevant agencies. Section 1036,      in addition to imposing onerous requirements, conflicts      with procedures for detainee reviews in the field that      have been developed based on many years of experience by      military officers and the Department of Defense. In short,      the matters addressed in these provisions are already well      regulated by existing procedures and have traditionally      been left to the discretion of the Executive branch.       Broadly speaking, the detention provisions in this bill      micromanage the work of our experienced counterterrorism      professionals, including our military commanders,      intelligence professionals, seasoned counterterrorism      prosecutors, or other operatives in the field. These      professionals have successfully led a Government-wide effort      to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qa'ida and its      affiliates and adherents over two consecutive      Administrations. The Administration believes strongly that it      would be a mistake for Congress to overrule or limit the      tactical flexibility of our Nation's counterterrorism      professionals.       Any bill that challenges or constrains the President's      critical authorities to collect intelligence, incapacitate      dangerous terrorists, and protect the Nation would prompt the      President's senior advisers to recommend a veto.       Joint Strike Fighter Aircraft (JSF): The Administration      also appreciates the Committee's inclusion in the bill of a      prohibition on using funds authorized by S. 1867 to be used      for the development of the F136 JSF alternate engine. As the      Administration has stated, continued development of the F136      engine is an unnecessary diversion of scarce resources.       Medium Extended Air Defense Systems (MEADS): The      Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the      Department's air and missile defense programs; however, it      strongly objects to the lack of authorization of      appropriations for continued development of the MEADS      program. This lack of authorization could trigger unilateral      withdrawal by the United States from the MEADS Memorandum of      Understanding (MOU) with Germany and Italy, which could      further lead to a DoD obligation to pay all contract costs--a      scenario that would likely exceed the cost of satisfying      DoD's commitment under the MOU. Further, this lack of      authorization could also call into question DoD's ability to      honor its financial commitments in other binding cooperative      MOUs and have adverse consequences for other international      cooperative programs.       Overseas Construction Funding for Guam and Bahrain: The      Administration has serious concerns with the limitation on      execution of the United States and Government of Japan funds      to implement the realignment of United States Marine Forces      from Okinawa to Guam. The bill would unnecessarily restrict      the ability and flexibility of the President to execute our      foreign and defense policies with our ally, Japan. The      Administration also has concerns over the lack of      authorization of appropriations for military construction      projects in Guam and Bahrain. Deferring or eliminating these      projects could send the unintended message that the United      States does not stand by its allies or its agreements.       Provisions Authorizing Activities with Partner Nations: The      Administration appreciates the support of the Committee to      improve capabilities of other nations to support      counterterrorism efforts and other U.S. interests, and urges      the inclusion of DoD's requested proposals, which balance      U.S. national security and broader foreign policy interests.      The Administration would prefer only an annual extension of      the support to foreign nation counter-drug activities      authority in line with its request. While the inclusion of      section 1207 (Global Security Contingency Fund) is welcome,      several provisions may affect Executive branch agility in the      implementation of this authority. Section 1204 (relating to      Yemen) would require a 60-day notify and wait period not only      for Yemen, but for all other countries as well, which would      impose an excessive delay and seriously impede the Executive      branch's ability to respond to emerging requirements.       Unrequested Authorization Increases: Although not the only      examples in S. 1867, the Administration notes and objects to      the addition of $240 million and $200 million, respectively,      in unrequested authorization for unneeded upgrades to M-1      Abrams tanks and Rapid Innovation Program research and      development in this fiscally constrained environment. The      Administration believes the amounts appropriated in FY 2011      and requested in FY 2012 fully fund DoD's requirements in      these areas.       Advance Appropriations for Acquisition: The Administration      objects to section 131, which would provide only incremental      funding--undermining stability and cost discipline--rather      than the advance appropriations that the Administration      requested for the procurement of Advanced Extremely High      Frequency satellites and certain classified programs.       Authority to Extend Deadline for Completion of a Limited      Number of Base Closure and Realignment (BRAC)      Recommendations: The Administration requests inclusion of its      proposed authority for the Secretary or Deputy Secretary of      Defense to extend the 2005 BRAC implementation deadline for      up to ten (10) recommendations for a period of no more than      one year in order to ensure no disruption to the full and      complete implementation of each of these recommendations, as      well as continuity of operations. Section 2904 of the Defense      Base Closure and Realignment Act imposes on DoD a legal      obligation to close and realign all installations so      recommended by the BRAC Commission to the President and to      complete all such closures and realignments no later than      September 15, 2011. DoD has a handful of recommendations with      schedules that complete implementation close to the statutory      deadline.       TRICARE Providers: The Administration is currently      undertaking a review with relevant agencies, including the      Departments of Defense, Labor, and Justice, to clarify the      responsibility of health care providers under civil and      workers' rights laws. The Administration therefore objects to      section 702, which categorically excludes TRICARE network      providers from being considered subcontractors for purposes      of the Federal Acquisition Regulation or any other law.       Troops to Teachers Program: The Administration urges the      Senate's support for the transfer of the Troops to Teachers      Program to DoD in FY 2012, as reflected in the President's      Budget and DoD's legislative proposal to amend the Elementary      and Secondary Education Act of 1965 and Title 10 of the U.S.      Code in lieu of section 1048. The move to Defense will help      ensure that this important program supporting members of the      military as teachers is retained and provide better oversight      of 6 program outcomes by simplifying and streamlining program      management. The Administration looks forward to keeping the      Congress abreast of this transfer, to ensure it runs smoothly      and has no adverse impact on program enrollees.       Constitutional concerns: A number of the bill's provisions      raise additional constitutional concerns, such as sections      233 and 1241, which could intrude on the President's      constitutional authority to maintain the confidentiality of      sensitive diplomatic communications. The Administration looks      forward to working with the Congress to address these and      other concerns.
