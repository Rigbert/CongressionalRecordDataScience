 President. I rise today to join my colleagues Senators Boxer and Ensign to introduce legislation to authorize the United States Mint to issue a commemorative coin that will honor the San Francisco Old Mint and help restore this historic building in downtown San Francisco.  The San Francisco Old Mint Building is an important historical landmark for San Francisco, the State of California, and the United States.  Beginning its operations in 1854, the Old Mint Building was established to take advantage of the plentiful gold and silver mined in the West during the California Gold Rush. At one point, more than half of the money minted in the United States came from the San Francisco Mint, and it once held a third of the Nation's gold supply.  The Old Mint Building, located in the heart of the city, has been standing for more than 125 years as the oldest stone building in San Francisco.  The Greek-revivalist design of the Old Mint Building was created by architect Alfred B. Mullet, who also designed the U.S. Treasury Building and the Old Executive Office Building in Washington, DC. The San Francisco Old Mint building is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Aided by its magnificent stone structure, the Old Mint Building was able to survive the terrible San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906. In fact, the Mint was the only financial institution that remained operable after the earthquake and the building was used as the treasury for the city's disaster relief funds.  The San Francisco Old Mint Building minted coins until 1937 when the building became too small and its operations moved to a larger space elsewhere in San Francisco. In the years since then, the building has deteriorated.  In 1994, the Bureau of the Mint closed the Old Mint because it could not afford the then-estimated $20 million seismic retrofit to bring the building up to code. Since 2003, the General Services Administration transferred ownership of the building to the City of San Francisco.  The San Francisco Museum and Historical Society has proposed an exciting project to restore and rejuvenate the Old Mint Building in downtown San Francisco. A fine history museum supported by shops and a visitor's center will combine to make the building a striking and viable destination.  The bill authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue 100,000 $5 gold coins and 500,000 $1 silver coins emblematic of the San Francisco Old Mint Building and its importance to California and the United States.  Proceeds generated from the sale of these commemorative coins will be paid to the San Francisco Museum andHistorical Society for the restoration of the Old Mint Building.  The San Francisco Old Mint is venerated by coin collectors, Californians, and millions of Americans as a national treasure and I believe it is worthy of a commemorative coin.  I believe honoring and restoring the San Francisco Old Mint building is an important historic preservation project.  Next year will mark the 100th anniversary of the building's survival of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire.  No other mint has been commemorated and because issuance of these coins would make a vital contribution to preserving this national treasure, the San Francisco Old Mint merits commemoration at this time.  I hope my colleagues will join me to support this legislation to help preserve and restore this majestic building and honor the important role it played in rebuilding the great ``City by the Bay''.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1881       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``San Francisco Old Mint      Commemorative Coin Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) The Granite Lady played an important role in the      history of the Nation.       (2) The San Francisco Mint was established pursuant to an      Act of Congress of July 3, 1852, to convert miners' gold from      the California gold rush into coins.       (3) The San Francisco Old Mint Building was designed by      architect A.B. Mullett, who also designed the United States      Treasury Building and the Old Executive Office Building.       (4) The solid construction of the Granite Lady enabled it      to survive the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire, making      it the only financial institution that was able to operate      immediately after the earthquake as the treasury for disaster      relief funds for the city of San Francisco.       (5) Coins struck at the San Francisco Old Mint are      distinguished by the ``S'' mint mark.       (6) The San Francisco Old Mint is famous for having struck      many rare, legendary issues, such as the 1870-S $3 coin,      which is valued today at well over $1,000,000, and the 1894-S      dime which is comparatively rare.       (7) The San Francisco Old Mint Commemorative Coin will be      the first commemorative coin to honor a United States mint      facility.     SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS.
