All the businesses depended upon energy, small businesses and residential consumers.  The Republicans would not allow that amendment to be debated on the floor of the House because of its kind of embarrassing links between Enron and the Bush administration and the fraud that was perpetrated on the Western United States.  Ken Lay, as the chief executive of Enron, was the mastermind of this fraud. He bilked billions of dollars from millions of people for his own personal profit and that of his executives, and he was finally today brought to justice. We finally saw him in handcuffs on television, and hopefully he will have a long stay in jail, and hopefully he will also have to work during that stay and not just get free room and board, because he has already extracted enough cost from hard-working Americans.  When we asked for a meeting with Vice President Cheney during the huge runup in prices in the Western United States, we got together; he got together with the Northwest delegation. And he, in response to concerns I raised, said that I was really stupid, and I just did not understand that this had nothing to do with fraud, abuse, or market manipulation. This was all about market forces. I just did not understand markets and that Enron was a leader in markets, and I just did not understand markets, and unless we build one 500-megawatt plant every week for the next 15 years, and this is Vice President Cheney, the $4,000 megawatt prices, about 100 times normal, would continue forever.  Of course, then we appealed to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, seeing that the Vice President's mind was slightly closed on the matter. And the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, chaired by Pat Wood of Texas, with a couple of other appointees chosen by Ken Lay of Texas, of Enron, refused to look into it. Finally, after additional pressure was raised, they said they would look into it. Then they said, no, it is just market forces. There is no market manipulation.  Then a strange thing happened. The Senate changed hands. When the Senator from Vermont changed to Independent, and the Democrats took overthe Senate, and Diane Feinstein from California threatened to hold hearings on what was going on in the Western energy market, suddenly the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reviewed its records and found, lo and behold, there was a scandal.
