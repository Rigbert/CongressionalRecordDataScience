 1061. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to acquire Fern Lake and the surrounding watershed in the States of Kentucky and Tennessee for addition to Cumberland Gap National Historic Park, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last month the Bush Administration unveiled a new national energy strategy that strikes an important balance between the twin priorities of production and conservation. Today I am proud to introduce legislation with Congressman Hal Rogers that takes a step toward fulfilling the conservation side of that energy equation in my home state of Kentucky.  Our bill, the Fern Lake Conservation and Recreation Act of 2001, will authorize the Cumberland Gap National Historical Park to purchase Fern Lake, a natural landmark on the Kentucky-Tennessee border that has served as the municipal water supply for Middlesboro, KY since the lake was constructed in 1893. This bill will protect the lake as a clean and safe source of rural water for Kentuckians, enhance the scenic and recreational value of Cumberland Gap National Historical Park, and increase tourism opportunities in the three states that border the Park--Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia.  For those who may be less familiar with this part of the country, Fern Lake is a beautiful and pristine body of water set against the backdrop of the Appalachian Mountains. The 150-acre lake presently sits adjacent to the Park and is part of the viewshed from Pinnacle Overlook, which is one of the Park's most popular attractions. It is said that the glassy surface of Fern Lake is so clear that you can see fish swimming 10 feet below the surface. Perhaps that is one of the reasons why Middlesboro Mayor Ben Hickman describes his town's water supply as one of the best in the United States.  With a lake of such natural beauty and exceptional water quality, it is no wonder that the citizens and community leaders want to protect it. Although Fern Lake has been privately owned for most of its existence, it has been for sale since July 2000, and there is concern in Middlesboro that a new owner may not share the same interests regarding the lake as those embraced by the community. That is why a growing chorus of community leaders and citizens have called for the Cumberland Gap National Historical Park to purchase Fern Lake. This solution would guarantee management of thiswonderful resource consistent with the needs of the community.  This legislation is needed because currently the Park is prohibited by law from expanding its boundaries by purchasing new land with appropriated funds. Our bill, therefore, authorizes the Park to use appropriated funds, if necessary, to purchase Fern Lake (and up to 4,500 acres of the surrounding watershed) and to manage the lake for public recreational uses. This bill also requires the Park to maintain Fern Lake as a source of clean drinking water, authorizes the Park to sell water to the city of Middlesboro, and permits the proceeds of the water sales to be spent by the Secretary of the Interior without further appropriation. And because the scenic and recreational values of Fern Lake will benefit the tourism industry in all three adjacent states--Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia--the legislation directs the Secretary of the Interior to consult with appropriate officials in these states to determine the best way to manage the municipal water supply and to promote the increased tourism opportunities associated with Park ownership of Fern Lake.  This bill is a small but important example of the type of targeted conservation measures that are essential to making a national energy policy work for all Americans. This is not the conservation of environmental extremism that seeks to divide communities, vilify opponents, or present unworkable approaches in the name of political opportunism. Rather, this is conservation that builds upon community consensus. It is common sense conservation that seeks environmental solutions that will enhance rather than disturb local industries such as tourism, which have been so vital to economically depressed areas such as southeastern Kentucky. And finally, this is conservation that is careful to consider, and where necessary, to protect, the property rights of affected landowners. This bill requires that the Park acquire land from willing sellers only, and the National Park Service has assured us that it has no authority to place land-use restrictions on private land until the land is actually acquired by the Park.  Targeted and consensus-driven conservation measures such as this one are not always easy to craft, but they are always worth the effort. This bill is proof that environmental protection and economic development need not be at odds, and that there are a number of responsible and practical conservation opportunities that can bring communities together rather than tear them apart. Indeed, if this simple formula for finding consensus conservation opportunities--broad community support, local employment, and private property protections--was replicated in all 50 States, we could make actual and noticeable strides as a nation toward protecting and promoting our natural treasures.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1061       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Fern Lake Conservation and      Recreation Act of 2001''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:       (1) Fern Lake and its surrounding watershed in Bell County,      Kentucky, and Claiborne County, Tennessee, is within the      potential boundaries of Cumberland Gap National Historical      Park as originally authorized by the Act of June 11, 1940 (54      Stat 262; 16 U.S.C. 261 et seq.).       (2) The acquisition of Fern Lake and its surrounding      watershed and its inclusion in Cumberland Gap National      Historical Park would protect the vista from Pinnacle      Overlook, which is one of the park's most valuable scenic      resources and most popular attractions, and enhance      recreational opportunities at the park.       (3) Fern Lake is the water supply source for the City of      Middlesboro, Kentucky, and environs.       (4) The 4500-acre Fern Lake watershed is privately owned,      and the 150-acre lake and part of the watershed are currently      for sale, but the Secretary of the Interior is precluded by      the first section of the Act of June 11, 1940 (16 U.S.C.      261), from using appropriated funds to acquire the lands.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of the Act are--       (1) to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to use      appropriated funds if necessary, in addition to other      acquisition methods, to acquire from willing sellers Fern      Lake and its surrounding watershed in order to protect scenic      and natural resources and enhance recreational opportunities      at Cumberland Gap National Historical Park; and       (2) to allow the continued supply of safe, clean, drinking      water from Fern Lake to the City of Middlesboro, Kentucky,      and environs.
