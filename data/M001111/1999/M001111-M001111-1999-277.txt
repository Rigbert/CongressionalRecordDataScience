 President, I came here today to talk about the work we are doing to protect our environment, but first I would just like to express my deep sorrow over yesterday's tragic shooting in Littleton, Colorado and to tell the students, teachers and their families that they are in our thoughts and our hearts.  Mr. President, we are here to celebrate the last Earth Day before the 21st century. As a nation, we have made great strides in the last three decades in protecting important ecosystems, cleaning up past mistakes and improving the environmental records of industry and agriculture. I am confident that as we move into the 21st century, our Nation will continue to be a leader in both environmental protection and economic strength.  In the Pacific Northwest, one of our most pressing challenges is to restore our dwindling wild salmon stocks. This year, the Puget Sound chinook salmonwas listed on the endangered species list, making it one of the first species in the Nation to require protection efforts in an intensely developed metropolitan area.  This will give our region an opportunity to highlight again how we can both thrive economically and provide critical protection to other species. Already we have seen examples across our State. Farmers have modified irrigation systems to make them more salmon-friendly. Forest landowners have foregone timber harvest in sensitive areas and replanted along streams with vegetation particularly beneficial to fish. Citizens of our urban areas have taken the first steps toward a comprehensive plan to restore urban salmon and have joined forces to restore devastated wetlands and streams.  One of the important lessons we should have learned about environmental protection is it is much easier--and far less costly--to preserve an ecosystem rather than try to repair it once it has been destroyed. That is one of the reasons I am pushing my colleagues so hard to pass my legislation to create a Wild and Scenic River on the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River. These are the last free-flowing 51 miles of this mighty river and they contain some of the most productive and important fish spawning habitat in the lower 48 States. The reach produces 80 percent of the Columbia Basin's fall chinook salmon, as well as thriving runs of steelhead trout and sturgeon. While most of the Columbia River Basin were being developed during the middle of this century, the Hanford Reach and other buffer areas within the Hanford Nuclear Reservation were kept pristine by the same veil of secrecy and security that lead to the contamination of the central Hanford Site.  Mr. President, we have been offered an opportunity to continue to grow the rural economy of central Washington while protecting this vital source of our economic strength that the Columbia River provides. Creating a Wild and Scenic River could help us avoid drastic protection measures, like breaching the dams along the Columbia Snake River systems to save salmon. This simple step will demonstrate our commitment both to protecting wild salmon and to the economic and social structure of the inland West.  Today, we also celebrate the introduction of legislation to protect another national treasure: the wilderness of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Senator Roth will again introduce, and I will cosponsor, his bill to protect one of the only remaining complete and undisturbed arctic ecosystems in the world. It is home to an abundance of wildlife, including grizzly and polar bears, musk-oxen, wolves, and a host of migratory bird species. It is also home to the magnificent porcupine caribou herd, whose 160,000 members rely on this coastal plain for their calving grounds.  This bill will prohibit development of oil within the fragile wilderness of the refuge. Oil development would likely disrupt the porcupine caribou and force them to change their calving grounds and migratory routes. This, in turn, will adversely impact the lifestyle and culture of their neighbors, the Gwich'in people.  Proponents of development claim that only 13,000 acres of the refuge will be impacted. While this may be true, that development will take place in the biological heart of ANWR and have a devastating impact on the wilderness values of the area. In this biological heart, developers will create a major industrial complex. They will build hundreds of miles of roads and pipelines, erect housing for thousands of workers, and construct two sea ports and one airport. These developments will lead to mining of enormous amounts of gravel, will require diversion of streams and will result in pollution of fragile tundra.  Mr. President, as we celebrate the last earth day before the 21st century, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come together to support both of these bills in order to hand down to our children and grandchildren a part of America's great natural legacy.                          ____________________
