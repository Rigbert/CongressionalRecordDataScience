Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Chairman, it is pretty hard for somebody in the private sector that pays taxes on their manufacturing equipment, that pays property taxes on the building that is used to house the manufacturing equipment, that pays their employees a decent wage, that takes out Social Security and State and Federal income taxes and, hopefully, provides benefits, including health care benefits, to compete against those who are working in the prison where the taxpayers pay for the medical benefits, the taxpayers pay for the room and board, and the land and the prison is completely tax exempt.  Now, the gentleman from Minnesota says that what FPI provides is bought by the Department of Defense. What this bill does is to provide the same reforms that were provided a few years earlier with FPI contracting with the Department of Defense. The gentleman from Minnesota says it has worked with the Department of Defense. What we want to do is to have it work with every other Federal agency as successfully as it has done with the Department of Defense.
