 President, the issue is this. We do not have enough Blackhawks for our own troops, much less the Colombian troops. The Blackhawks are much more expensive, about $1,000 an hour more expensive to operate. The Huey II will get the job done. We ought to do that in the most efficient way, looking not only at this year's appropriation but down the road. We will have to pick up the operation and maintenance cost on the Blackhawk in subsequent years. The Huey II will do the job.  The Senator from Connecticut has done his usual articulate job of arguing for a home State interest. The Blackhawk is made in Connecticut. I would probably be making the same speech if I were from Connecticut. But the least expensive alternative is the Huey II. That is why the committee recommended what it did.
