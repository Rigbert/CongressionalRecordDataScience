 President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following treaty transmitted to the Senate on January 9, 2003 by the President of the United States: Agreement Amending Treaty with Canada Concerning Pacific Coast Albacore Tuna Vessels and Port Privileges (Treaty Document No. 108-1).  I further ask unanimous consent that the treaty be considered as having been read the first time, that it be referred with accompanying papers to the Committee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed, and that the President's message be printed in the Record.
