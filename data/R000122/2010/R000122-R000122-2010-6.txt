President, this week, with little fanfare, we completed work on an important bill, through a bipartisan process, by passage of S. 3984, the Museum and Library Services Act of 2010.  This bill updates museum and library services funded through the Institute for Museum and Library Services, IMLS, to better meet the needs of Americans of all ages and in all types of locations.  The Museum and Library Services Act represents our national commitment to the institutions that are essential to building strong and vibrant communities. Through a relatively modest federal investment, this law helps build capacity to support and expand access to library and museum services at the State and local level.  We were able to complete this legislation because we worked together--across the aisle and across the Capitol, and with the input of the museum and library community.  I would like to take a moment to recognize and thank our HELP Committee Chairman Tom Harkin, Ranking Member Mike Enzi, and Senator Richard Burr for working with me to craft this bipartisan legislation. I would also like to recognize our cosponsors, Senators Cochran, Collins, and Tester. In addition, I would like to express my appreciation to House Education and Labor Committee Chairman George Miller and Ranking Member John Kline for quickly guiding this bill through the House.  No piece of legislation can be enacted without the diligent work of dedicated staff. I would like to thank Kristin Romero and Margaret Bomba of the office of legislative counsel who worked with us to draft the bill. I would also like to recognize the efforts of staff: Thomas Showalter, Pam Smith, and Bethany Little with Chairman Harkin; Beth Buehlmann and Kelly Hastings with Senator Enzi; Celia Sims with Senator Burr; Lory Yudin with the HELP Committee; and in my office, Elyse Wasch, Moira Lenehan-Razzuri, Andrew Odgren, and Jason Kanter.  Additionally, all of us who worked on this bill appreciate the technical assistance and feedback we received from the staff of IMLS. Finally, I would liketo commend the American Library Association and the American Association of Museums for developing thoughtful recommendations and working with us to improve museum and library services across the Nation. I especially appreciate the wisdom and input I have received from the vibrant library and museum community in Rhode Island.  I look forward to this legislation being swiftly signed into law.                          ____________________
