 President, I would like to extend my sincere thanks for the continued involvement of Vermont high school teachers and principals in my annual State of the Union essay contest. This year, 799 Vermont students from 39 high schools wrote essays detailing what they thought were the most important issues facing our country. We could not have achieved this level of participation without the help of engaged educators throughout the State.  Each and every day, teachers encourage students to think critically and develop their own ideas. I appreciate that so many teachers have used the essay contest to challenge their students to share what they consider to be priorities for the United States. This year's submissions were some of the most thoughtful to date, and I have no doubt that is because of the encouragement of engaged teachers from across the State.  The success of this essay contest also depends on a dedicated team of volunteer judges, all of whom are also high school teachers. This year, we asked our five judges--some of whom have served for many years--to read more essays in less time, and we greatly appreciate the serious consideration and commitment they brought to the task. I would like to take a moment to recognize this year's judges: Bradley Archer, Woodstock Union High School; Jason Gorczyk, Milton High School; Krista Huling, South Burlington High School; Roberta ``Cookie'' Steponaitis, Vergennes Union High School; and Terri Vest, Twinfield Union School.  I would also like to enter into the Record the names of the 39 high schools that participated this year:  Arlington Memorial High School, Bellows Falls Union High School, Bellows Free Academy--Fairfax, Blue Mountain High School, Burlington High School, Burlington Technical Center, Burr & Burton Academy, Canaan Memorial High School, Champlain Valley Union High School, Colchester High School, Enosburg Falls High School, Green Mountain Technology and Career Center, Hanover High School, Hartford High School, Harwood Union High School, Leland and Gray Union High School, Mill River Union High School, Milton High School, Missisquoi Valley Union High School, Mount Mansfield Union High School, Mt.

Additionally, I would like to thank the schools where an especially large number of students wrote essays. Vermont Commons School and Missisquoi Valley Union High School had more than 25 participants. Green Mountain Technology and Career Center and South Burlington High School both had more than 50 students write essays. Mount Abraham Union High School had more than 100 members of their freshmen class write essays. Rutland High School assigned the contest to their entire freshmen class, with more than 200 students participating.  I would like to thank all of Vermont's teachers and principals for their tireless work educating students and for helping to make the sixth annual State of the Union essay contest a success.                          ____________________
