President, the full scope of fundraising irregularities on both sides of the aisle and on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue should be the subject of investigation.  Today, we have seen reports that a lobbyist for a foreign government was being shaken down and a foreign ambassador was contacted in this regard by the House Member who chairs the committee charged with investigating allegations of fundraising abuses.  The resolution that many just voted for carefully excludes any attention to congressional conduct. The resolution on which we are now prepared to vote lets the chips fall where they may. It includes congressional election campaign activities.  Having just voted to instruct the Attorney General to apply for an independent counsel to investigate those with the Presidential campaign, let us proceed to support--not dodge by trying to table--a resolution that would allow the Attorney General to proceed with respect to congressional fundraising abuses, as well. Otherwise, the American people are going to see this as a blatant political attack on the President as he goes to Helsinki that excludes any attention to ourselves.
