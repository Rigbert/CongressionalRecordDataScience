And the words at the base of that statue are emblazoned in the minds of families like our own going back generations. ``Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.'' Surely, President Trump has read these words.  I support robust efforts to make America safe and secure, and have served on all the committees in this Congress that aim to do that. But workable solutions should ensure America's safety, without destroying our heritage as an immigrant Nation dedicated to liberty and justice for all.  President Trump's mandate actually will make America less safe because it penalizes worthy individuals and puts them at greater risk, and it actually gives terrorist cells ammunition to use against America.                              {time}  1100  Think about it. This mandate puts people at risk who helped America in our battle against terrorism abroad and at home, and it punishes innocent individuals caught in the crossfire fleeing terror and tribal conflict.  Dangerously, this misconceived executive order will spur anti-American sentiment globally and on the internet spurring more terrorism. The old World War II motto ``loose lips sink ships'' is going to happen because of the way this was conducted. Reckless rhetoric puts our Nation at greater risk at home and puts Americans fighting for us and those traveling abroad in greater danger.  Mr. Speaker, I cordially invite the President to northern Ohio. Come and meet some of the people whose lives your order changed. I think you will change your mind.
