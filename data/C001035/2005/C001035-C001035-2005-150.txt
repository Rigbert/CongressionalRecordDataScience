President, last week, Senator Lieberman and I offered, and the Senate adopted, Amendment #1142 to H.R. 2360, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act. The amendment, which seeks to improve the process for providing homeland security grants to State and local governments, is nearly identical to S. 21, the Homeland Security Grant Enhancement Act of 2005, a bill which was reported out of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. S. 21 was placed on the Senate's legislative calendar on May 4, 2005, and a detailed and comprehensive report from the Committee, Senate Report 109-71, accompanied S. 21 at that time. Because of the near identity of S. 21 and the amendment, this report pertains to Amendment #1142 as well.
