 President, I would like to take a moment to recognize the achievements of American Legion Post 27 out of Muscatine, IA. This group hosted its first World War II Honor Tour in Washington, DC, in October 2008, sponsoring 30 World War II veterans from the Muscatine area. The local community raised funds by holding yard sales, dances, and tournaments, and also by asking help from local businesses and friends. The veterans attending the tour were accompanied by family members and volunteers who donated their time and money to come along on the trip. While in DC, the group visited several historical sites including the World War II Memorial and Arlington National Cemetery. I am very proud to represent these honorable veterans and ask unanimous consent that an article written about their time in Washington by Melissa Regennitter of the Muscatine Journal be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                      [From the Muscatine Journal]                        (By Melissa Regennitter)       Muscatine, Iowa.--A trip to Washington D.C. became a      memorable experience for 30 World War II veterans who had the      chance to share memories and make new ones with old friends.      Many people made new friends along the journey as well.       Muscatine hosted its first WWII Honor Tour in October after      much hard work and dedication from area volunteers who raised      more than $35,000 to give the vets an all-inclusive tour of      D.C. and Virginia memorials. That trip included a visit to      their memorial, the World War II Memorial in D.C.--situated      between Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Memorial. The      trip came about after Pam Ramer, former president of the      American Legion Post 27 Auxiliary heard a heartwarming story      about an Honor Tour her uncle Jim Marshall, 82, a former Navy      radio operator from Mount Pleasant, had done. His wife      Pauline helped him out and their tour took place in April.       Marshall had already taken the trip, complete with meals,      bus tour, hotel and flight, so Ramer looked to him to get      things in order. He had told her of the emotional journey it      had been, how the vets were treated with dignity, cheers and      handshakes, and how much it seemed to mean to them to go on a      trip they otherwise may never have taken. By June Ramer had      set her mind to the goal and knew it would be about $1,100      per person. Though it felt like an impossible target,      fundraising and a town with a love for its veterans made the      elaborate scheme possible.       Fundraisers galore! Post 27 held a yard sale, 1950s-60s      dance, car show, volleyball and golf tournaments, dinners and      silent auctions. Business in town took part, offering a place      to hold the events, donations and prizes. Senators,      corporations and school kids who collected change donated      money and were recognized on the ``flag of honor'' wall at      the Legion. A woman even gave a house full of furniture to      auction off and a local auctioneer volunteered his time to      help sell it.       Everyone involved contacted businesses and business      associates to ask for support. The reception from the      community was remarkable as the word spread; the goal was met      a few weeks before the send-off ceremony was held.       AirTran Airways went out of their way to make scheduling      accommodations for the 48 people who went; 30 veterans and 18      family members and helpers. The pilots were as happy to have      the vets on the plane as the vets were to be going to D.C.      When the plane landed at the Ronald Reagan Washington      National Airport, fire trucks sprayed the aircraft down as it      taxied in. The captain said it was a high honor and a way to      show appreciation for the vets.       Many monuments. The group arrived on Thursday, Oct. 2, to a      Tysons Corner Marriot in Northern Virginia. The weekend was      packed with visits to historical sites including The World      War II, Jefferson, Lincoln, Vietnam, Marine Corps and Korean      memorials as well as Air Force and Navy memorials and      museums. They also went to Arlington National Cemetery, the      Pentagon, Mt. Vernon and the estate of George Washington, the      U.S. Capitol, the White House and downtown D.C. where they      shopped for souvenirs and saw Ford's Theater where Abe      Lincoln was shot and the home he died in.       At Arlington, a visit to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier      brought tears to the eyes of many and honor to all as a group      of the Muscatine-area veterans were allowed to participate in      a wreath-laying ceremony.       The veterans were treated to fine dining where they enjoyed      extravagant meals and desserts which were all a part of the      tour package. A helping hand. Along with the 29 men and one      woman veteran were 10 family members who paid their own way      to take the trip. In addition to those people, eight      volunteers paid their own way so they could be there to push      wheelchairs, lend a hand to those who might need it, keep      things organized and even make the veterans laugh. What ended      up happening was a new found sense of honor for those who had      served. The helpers were at times more emotional than the      veterans and bonds grew that no one really expected. All of      the helpers say that they came home with new friends and made      memories they'll never forget.                          ____________________
