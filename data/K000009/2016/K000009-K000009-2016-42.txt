Speaker and Members, it is my privilege to welcome Congressman Warren Davidson, his wife, Lisa; and their two beautiful children, Rachel and Zach, to Washington, D.C.  To the Davidsons, their extended family, and their friends who are here to support them, we all wish you hearty congratulations. To Congressman Davidson, on behalf of a gratefulNation, I want to extend our gratitude for your many years of service in the United States Army. Thank you for your dedication to duty, honor, and country.  Though I am dean of Ohio's delegation, it seems just like yesterday when I was in your shoes. This moment you will never forget. You have worked hard to put together a winning coalition to win a hard-fought campaign, and that takes a dedicated person and a very giving family to make the necessary sacrifices.  To accomplish worthy objectives during your time in Congress, you will want to find issues that you can build coalitions around and then enlist others on both sides of the center aisle in that cause. Perhaps the best advice I can give you is to stay close to the people where you came from in Troy, Ohio; in Clark, Miami, Darke, Preble, and Butler Counties; and as Daniel Webster's words inspire us through the ages, dedicate our efforts to a higher cause, developing the resources of our land, calling forth its powers, building up its institutions, promoting all its great interests, and seeing whether we also, in our day and generation, may not perform something worthy to be remembered.  Welcome to the United States House of Representatives to Warren, Lisa, and your family.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Cincinnati, Ohio (Mr. Chabot) my dear colleague. He is the dean, the longest serving member, on the Republican side.
