Speaker, due to my attending the funeral of a memberof our family on Wednesday, October 8, 2003, a day for which I requested and was granted leave of absence, I missed five recorded votes.  I would like the Record to reflect that had I been here for these votes, on rollcall 535, final passage of H.R. 3108, Pension Funding Equity Act of 2003, I would have voted ``yea.''  On rollcall 536, H.R. 2297, Veteran Benefits Act of 2003, I would have voted ``yea.''  On rollcall 537, H.R. 2998, to amend title 10, U.S. Code, to exempt certain members of the Armed Forces from the requirement to pay subsistence charges while hospitalized, I strongly support this bill and have been complaining to the Secretary of Defense regarding unconscionable charging of $1 per minute for men and women on duty in Iraq who want to call home, and would have voted ``yea.''  On rollcall 538, H. Res. 355, commemorating the 100th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the United States and Bulgaria, I would have voted ``yea.''  On rollcall 539, expressing the condolences of the House of Representatives in response to the murder of Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh, I would have voted ``yea.''                          ____________________
