President, on January 13 of this year, our country lost one of its most courageous diplomats--Ambassador Robert E. White. Ambassador White was 88 years old.  I knew Bob White, who graduated from my alma mater, Saint Michael's College in Vermont, in 1952, just 9 years before I did. But I would have admired him greatly no matter what college he went to because he had the qualities every American diplomat should possess--outstanding intellect, unimpeachable integrity, great courage, and a devotion to the ideals and values of this country.  In the 1980s, during the civil war in El Salvador, the United States--in what most historians now know was a tragic mistake--steadfastly supported the Salvadoran Army despite abundant evidence that some of its elite units were operating as death squads, arbitrarily arresting, torturing, and murdering civilians suspected of supporting the FMLN rebels.  Unlike some other U.S. officials who turned blind eyes to the heinous crimes that were being committed in the name of fighting communism, Ambassador White refused to remain silent. He publicly condemned the Salvadoran military and their rightwing backers who were implicated in atrocities such as the assassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero, who just days ago was put on the path to sainthood by Pope Francis, and the massacre of four American churchwomen.  For speaking out on behalf of the victims of those crimes, Bob White paid dearly. He was ridiculed by some in Congress and he was summarily removed from his job by then-Secretary of State Alexander Haig.  A January 15 obituary in the Washington Post describes Bob's life and career. As I was reading it, I could not help but wonder how things might have turned out differently if the powers-that-be during the 1980s had listened to him. My wife Marcelle and I talked about that. We asked ourselves: How many lives might have been saved if the Reagan administration, instead of firing Bob in 1981, had recognized the truth of what he was saying and supported negotiations to end the war in El Salvador.  Instead, the war dragged on for another decade, costing the lives of tens of thousands of people, mostly civilians. The tide only started to turn in 1989 after the cold-blooded murder of the six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter, at the University of Central America. It was ahorrific crime that top-ranking army officers tried to cover up.  It was thanks to the late Congressman Joe Moakley and his then-staff aide, now Congressman Jim McGovern, Bob Woodward, and Salvadoran investigator Leonel Gomez, whom I also came to know and respect, that the plot was uncovered and the killers identified.  During this time I talked often with Bob and I learned even more about those who were involved. After talking with him I went to El Salvador. The Salvadoran officials wanted me to see how they were investigating what had happened. They knew I had prosecuted murder cases, and they arranged for me to meet with the country's chief investigator. As he described the so-called investigation it just confirmed Ambassador White's suspicions. I told the Salvadoran investigator, and I told the press who were there, that they were conducting an obvious cover-up. Anybody who saw what they were calling an investigation would realize what they were doing.  As I left El Salvador, it was so obvious that rather than shamelessly removing Ambassador White from his post how much better things might have been if the State Department had recognized him for the true patriot he was and treated him as an example of what other U.S. diplomats should emulate.  Bob didn't stop when he left the Foreign Service. He went on to head the Center for International Policy where he continued his advocacy for human rights, defending the ideals and championing the causes he believed in right up to his death.  I like to think that all of our Foreign Service Officers aspire to follow in the footsteps of Ambassador Robert White. I hope they will learn from his example. If they do, the United States will be better served and the world will be a better place.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Washington Post obituary, and an article about Ambassador White by Margaret O'Brien Steinfels in Commonweal magazine.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 15, 2015]     Robert E. White, Who Criticized Policy on El Salvador as U.S.                          Ambassador, Dies at 88                         (By Pamela Constable)       In 1980, when El Salvador was erupting in guerrilla war and      military violence, the Carter administration sent a little-     known Foreign Service officer into the maelstrom as its new      ambassador, hoping he could help the U.S.-backed government      there find a reformist middle ground and prevent a full-scale      revolution.       Instead, Robert E. White became a controversial and      outspoken critic of assassinations and massacres being      carried out by American-trained military units and private      right-wing death squads. His views cost him his diplomatic      career but earned him the respect of many Salvadorans and,      ultimately, the vindication of history.       Mr. White, who had previously served as U.S. ambassador to      Paraguay, died Jan. 14 at a hospice in Arlington, Va. He was      88. The cause was bladder and prostate cancer, said a      daughter, Claire White.       His brief tenure in San Salvador was marked by atrocities      that became synonymous with right-wing violence during an era      of ideological conflicts in Central America: the      assassination of Catholic Archbishop Oscar Romero in March      1980 while he was saying Mass in the national cathedral, and      the abduction and killing that December of four American      women church workers: Maryknoll sisters Ita Ford and Maura      Clark, Ursuline Sister Dorothy Kazel and lay missioner Jean      Donovan.       Mr. White, who once said he was inspired to join the      Foreign Service by a ``quotient of idealism,'' worked to      promote human rights, economic reforms and political      negotiations between leftist rebels and El Salvador's civil-     military junta. But he soon found himself at loggerheads with      the rightist military and land-owning establishment, which      had powerful allies in Washington and Miami.       Unable to keep silent as security abuses mounted, Mr. White      began denouncing them in diplomatic cables, then in      interviews and congressional testimony. He famously called      rightist political leader Roberto D'Aubuisson a      ``pathological killer'' and charged that he had orchestrated      the execution of Romero.       Mr. White also accused the Salvadoran national guard of      murdering the Maryknoll women--two of whom he had dined with      the night before their disappearance. He was there when the      women's bodies were dug up, and he was quoted as vowing      angrily, ``This time the bastards won't get away with it.''       ``Bob was transformed by those events, especially the      killings of the Maryknolls, from a diplomatic functionary      into a person whose ethical and moral convictions conflicted      with his job,'' said Francisco Altschul, the current      Salvadoran ambassador to the United States, who was a leftist      political activist at the time. ``It took a lot of courage      and integrity to say what he did and to face the      consequences.''       Mr. White's outspoken posture drew praise from human rights      groups but death threats in El Salvador. His wife once      described being warned by her security guard in their      affluent San Salvador enclave that ``your neighbors would      like to kill you.''       The ambassador also faced strong opposition from powerful      Washington hawks including Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), who had      been annoyed with Mr. White's earlier human rights activism      in Paraguay and compared his posting to El Salvador to ``a      torch tossed in a pool of oil.''       By 1981, after the election of Ronald Reagan as president      ushered in a new era of anticommunist fervor in Washington,      Mr. White's days as ambassador were numbered. After coming      into conflict with Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr.,      Mr. White was removed from his post less than two weeks after      Reagan took office. He soon retired from the Foreign Service      after a 25-year career, claiming that he had been forced out      for political reasons.       ``In El Salvador, Bob believed the authoritarian regime was      morally repugnant and needed to change, but he worked very      hard to avoid the escalation of war and negotiate a      solution,'' said William M. LeoGrande, a professor at      American University and author of ``Our Own Backyard: The      United States in Central America, 1977-1992.''       ``The tragedy was that U.S. policy changed, El Salvador      became a Cold War proxy, and another decade of conflict      followed,'' LeoGrande said.       Once free of the constraints of diplomacy, Mr. White spent      much of the next three decades speaking his mind on U.S.      policy and official abuses in Latin America, while holding a      series of jobs, including a professorship at Simmons College      in Massachusetts and a senior associate position at the      Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.       He was a sarcastic critic of Washington's Cold War-era      policies in Latin America, particularly what he called the      ``primitive anti-communism'' that produced the U.S. embargo      against Fidel Castro's Cuba and support for hemispheric      dictators such as Gen. Augusto Pinochet in Chile and Gen.      Alfredo Stroessner in Paraguay. He accused the Reagan      administration in 1984 of covering up its knowledge of      D'Aubuisson's role in the Romero assassination.      Administration officials denied the allegations.       In 1989, Mr. White was named president of the Center for      International Policy, a liberal think tank in Washington, and      held that position at the time of his death. He also visited      numerous countries, from Haiti to Afghanistan, with      delegations to monitor elections and human rights.       Robert Edward White was born Sept. 21, 1926, in Melrose,      Mass. He served in the Navy as a radio operator in the      Pacific during World War II. He attended Saint Michael's      College in Vermont on the G.I. Bill, graduating in 1952, and      completed a master's degree in 1954 at Tufts University's      Fletcher School in Medford, Mass.       He joined the Foreign Service in 1955 and served in a      variety of positions related to Latin America. He was posted      in Colombia, Ecuador, Honduras and Nicaragua, served as      regional director of the Peace Corps and was a U.S.      representative to the Organization of American States. He was      ambassador to Paraguay from 1977 to 1980, when he was      transferred to El Salvador.       Survivors include his wife of 59 years, Maryanne Cahill      White of Alexandria, Va.; three children, Chris White of      Manassas, Va., Claire White of Cambridge, Mass., and Mary Lou      White of Evanston, Ill.; a brother, David White of      Alexandria; and three grandchildren.       A son, Kevin White, died in 2009; a daughter, Laura White,      died in 2014.       Mr. White always described himself as a diplomat and a      democrat rather than a leftist or moral zealot.       ``I don't go out looking for windmills to joust,'' he told      an interviewer from Commonweal magazine in 2001. ``And the      idea that I'm some sort of martyr? Well, I'm not.''       He argued that to avoid ending up on the wrong side of      history or in Vietnam-style military quagmires, the United      States needed to seek negotiated solutions to all conflicts,      maintain a moral component in its dealings with all regimes      and respect the will of local populations.       ``The military dictators of the world fear democracy more      than anything else,'' he told the Fletcher Forum, a      publication of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, in      1981. ``U.S. policy toward Latin America can be summed up in      three words: fear of revolution. Because we feared      revolution, we consistently opposed the forces of change      while uncritically supporting dictatorships and small      economic elites. We blinked at repression and participated in      the perversion of democracy throughout the hemisphere.''                                  ____               [From Commonweal Magazine, Jan. 19, 2015]                       Robert E. White, 1926-2015                    (By Margaret O'Brien Steinfels)       Robert White, who spent a quarter century in the U.S.      Foreign Service and was ambassador to El Salvador at the      beginning of its civil war, seems never to have forgotten      anything. Among the things he never forgot     were the murders of Jean Donovan and Sisters Dorothy Kazel,      Maura Clarke, and Ita Ford. White was present when their      bodies were recovered from shallow graves on December 4,      1980. He returned to the embassy as angry as his wife,      MaryAnne, had ever seen him. It changed him, she told me in      2001, when I interviewed her for a profile of Bob I wrote for      Commonweal. Indeed, his refusal to cover up Salvadoran      military involvement in their murders--and those of thousands      of Salvadorans, including Archbishop Oscar Romero--led to his      resignation from the Foreign Service in 1981. He continued      his work for democratic reforms and human rights in the      Caribbean and Latin America at the Carnegie Endowment for      Peace and the Center for International Policy.       Bob, who died on January 13 at the age of eighty-eight, was      a great interview; in 2001 I left his Washington office with      tapes full of details. He could summon conversations from      years past and recount policy details lost in the fog of      diplomatic maneuvering. Not only did he remember names and      details of long-past events, he was also forthcoming in his      analysis of U.S. foreign policy. He had joined the Foreign      Service in 1955; after President John Kennedy announced the      ``Alliance for Progress,'' he requested assignment in Latin      America. Designed to encourage democracy and human rights,      the new policy was a turn away from, as White put it, doing      the work of ``the colonial office.'' That derogatory title      summed up the tangled political and economic relationship      between the U.S. and its neighbors to the South. Even when      support in Washington faltered after Kennedy's assassination,      White tried to keep the policies of the Alliance in play.      Full-blown Cold War policies had returned in 1968 with      Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger, coloring White's years in      Honduras, Nicaragua, Columbia, Paraguay, and El Salvador.      While serving as U.S. representative to the Organization of      American States, he faced down Kissinger, whose statements      supporting Pinochet were contrary to U.S. policy. This      brought White to the edge of dismissal; he won the battle and      stayed on to serve in his final post, El Salvador.       A long history of interventions and exploitation of the      continent's natural resources made the United States the      imperial power that both democratic reformers and Marxists      loved to hate. White saw in the reformers the path to more      democratic governments and respect for human rights.      Washington, focused on Soviet threats and Fidel Castro's      support for guerrillas, increasingly favored the dictators      and caudillos. Secret agreements were struck between U.S.      military and intelligence agencies and their Latin      counterparts. This often put the Department of State, though      the official representative of the United States, on the      margins of both policy and practices. Jimmy Carter's victory      in 1976 pressed U.S. policy once again into a human rights      agenda; that ended with Ronald Reagan's election in 1980.       White had long found himself the middleman in many of the      struggles between Latin American governments and reformers as      well as with his own government. His job was to work with      each country's political leaders, notwithstanding their anti-     democratic policies. While they might tolerate his cajoling      and plain speaking about land reform, fair elections, and      human rights, they usually had a U.S. military representative      or CIA agent to turn to for direct contact with Washington      (often someone on the ambassador's own embassy staff). At the      same time, White made it his business to seek out and get to      know sympathetic academics, journalists, labor leaders,      clergy, and reformers in the Christian Democratic tradition.      He understood the central role the Catholic Church,      especially its cardinals and bishops, played among the social      and political elites. His friendship with some and parrying      with others gave him behind-the-scenes influence; his      attendance at Mass could be the occasion for a pointed homily      on topics a prelate might otherwise avoid. If White was      regarded with suspicion and contempt, especially by      Salvadoran politicians and military, his reputation among      Americans (and American Catholics) opposed to their endemic      violence and abuse was hardly better. The U.S. ambassador was      seen to be compromised by his position and not to be trusted.       After his resignation, White more than any U.S. official      exposed the hidden ties between U.S. military and      intelligence and their Latin American counterparts. He      testified against Salvadoran military for their complicity in      torture and murder, especially of the American churchwomen.      He never ceased pressing for better political and economic      conditions in Latin America, termination of sanctions against      Cuba, and an end to human rights abuses not only by      dictatorships but also by democracies. Bob's work as an      ambassador--from the United States at its best--never really      ended.
