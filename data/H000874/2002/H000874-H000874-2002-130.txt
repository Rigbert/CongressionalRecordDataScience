Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's yielding time and I rise in opposition to the rule.  The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Moran) in the last rule talked about a missed opportunity. This is another missed opportunity. We say, all of us, most of the people that I have heard say that the act of moving overseas to avoid participating in supporting the government, our defense, our fight against terrorism, our homeland security is an act which they condemn. Each and every one of us have said that. The American public thinks that that is an unpatriotic effort. The average person in the street is not going to move to Bermuda. The average person in the street is not going to move to some far-off place so that they can avoid taxation.  The chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means in the debate on the last bill said, ``Well, we're changing that. We're changing the death tax, which is why most people move overseas.''  The average taxpayer, who does not have any liability for the death tax, has to pay a FICA tax, the average working guy, and 50 percent of them pay more FICA tax, Social Security tax, than they do income tax. They cannot move overseas to avoid that and, in fact, they do not. They pay their fair taxes. They do not want to pay more than their fair share, but they pay their fair share.  But what the gentlewoman from Connecticut is speaking to and what this amendment speaks to is saying that we are not going to tolerate in America people who earn their money here, become rich here, successful here, to move overseas to avoid participating in continuing to make this country strong and free. We ought not to miss that opportunity. I would tell my friends in this body that this amendment was adopted overwhelmingly and bipartisanly in the Committee on Appropriations.  Reject this rule. Adopt a new one. Let us pass the DeLauro amendment.
