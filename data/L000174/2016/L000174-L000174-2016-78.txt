President, today I am reintroducing the Refugee Protection Act, along with Senators Franken, Durbig and Hirono. The world is confronting the worst refugee crisis since World War II. There are more than 65 million people who have been forcibly displaced around the globe. In the face of such staggering human suffering, we must not lower our torch--we must raise it higher. The Refugee Protection Act of 2016 takes important steps to bolster and update our laws to address the urgency of today's crisis. Now, more than ever, we must reaffirm our role as a humanitarian leader and renew our commitment to those fleeing persecution across the world.  The ongoing conflict in Syria makes clear the enormity of the humanitarian crisis we face. The terror inflicted by Bashar Al-Assad's regime and ISIS, which now subjects vast swaths of the region to its barbaric rule, has forced more than half of Syria's 23 million people from their homes and claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians Currently, there are more than 4.8 million registered Syrian refugees, the overwhelming majority of whom are women and children.  The United States must assert its leadership in efforts to resettle the innocent victims of this catastrophe. That is precisely the call so many of us respondedjiipj:st a year ago when the world came together stunned and heartbroken over the image of a 3-year-old Syrian child's lifeless body washed up on a Turkish beach. His tragic death touched our hearts and focused our attention on the desperate plight of this population. We must not forget him or the plight of the thousands of other children who are attempting the same terrifying journey to safety.  We also cannot ignore the humanitarian crisis that is closer to home. Ruthless armed gangs in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala continue to brutalize women and children with impunity. El Salvador and Guatemala have the highest child murder rates in the world--higher even than in the war zones of Iraq and Afghanistan. These three Central American countries also account for some of the highest rates of female homicide worldwide. The violence and impunity in the NorthernTriangle has forced thousands of mothers and children to flee and seek refuge wherever they can find it. The administration's Central American Refugees Minor, CAM program and its expansion of the Refugee Admissions Program in Central America are an acknowledgment of the unique protection needs resulting from this crisis.  In response to these challenges, and so many others around the world, we must adapt our laws to make good on our commitment as a nation of refuge and freedom. It is our moral obligation but it is also in our national interest.  Our refugee program sends a powerful message to the rest of the world: America is not your enemy. We stand against persecution and terrorism in all its forms. A strong refugee program undermines the hateful propaganda of ISIS that there is a war between Islam and the West, that Muslims are not welcome here, and that the ISIS caliphate is their true home. By offering refuge to the world's most vulnerable people, regardless of their religion or nationality, our refugee program lays bare those lies.  The landmark Refugee Act of 1980 affirmed the commitments we made in ratifying the 1951 Refugee Convention. The Refugee Protection Act of 2016 that Jam introducing today would reaffirm the spirit of those commitments and ensure that our law is up to meeting the humanitarian crisis of our time.  First, our bill would repeal harsh and unnecessary hurdles that exist in current law. It would eliminate the requirement that asylees file for asylum within one year of arrival. This is an arbitrary deadline that has prevented many deserving people from pursuing legitimate protection claims. It is particularly harmful to those individuals who may be slow to come forward and recount their trauma, such as victims of rape or torture. The bill also includes important safeguards to ensure that victims of gender-based persecution and LGBT asylum-seekers receive the protection they deserve.  Second, our bill provides critical protections for children and families. It would enable vulnerable minors seeking asylum to have their cases adjudicated by an asylum officer in a non-adversarial setting. Importantly, our bill would require the Attorney General to appoint counsel for children and other vulnerable individuals, allowing those who cannot advocate for themselves to receive a fair day in court. It is unconscionable that young children are being brought before U.S. Immigration judges without a lawyer to represent them. And, it would provide that all children in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security must be adequately screened for protection needs.  Our legislation also includes important protections for refugee families. It would allow certain children and family members of refugees to be considered derivative applicants for refugee status if they have undergone the requisite security checks. Refugees escaping persecution should not have to choose between finding refuge and keeping their families together.  Third, our bill promotes a more efficient asylum and refugee process. It would require timely notice of immigration charges and provide for updated conditions of detention, preventing individuals from languishing in detention at taxpayer expense and encouraging efficient case adjudication in our immigration courts. It includes measures to provide particularly vulnerable individuals with a full and fair opportunity to seek protection in the United States. The bill would also establish a secure ``alternatives to detention'' program to ensure the appearance of individuals in removal proceedings.  Finally, our bill would facilitate the integration of refugees into our communities, which is a longstanding tradition in this country. It ensures that the Reception and Placement grants, which help refugees become self-sufficient, are adjusted on an annual basis for inflation and cost of living. It would also provide that resettled refugees who work for our government overseas do not face unnecessary hurdles in their adjustment to lawful permanent residence. Our bill also authorizes a study of our refugee resettlement program and improves the collection of data to ensure that our resettlement system uses resources efficiently.  I am proud of the role Vermont has played in welcoming refugees. Since 1989, our State has welcomed nearly 8,000 refugees from more than a dozen war-torn countries. RecerThy, Mayor Christopher Louras and members of the Rutland community announced plans to resettle 100 Syrian refugees. I applaud their decision, which should serve as an example to other communities in Vermont and across the country. I am confident that Vermont will do its part to provide a welcoming home for these families.  I am hopeful that if we pause and remember the role refugees and asylum-seekers have played for generations in making our communities strong and vibrant, we will be able to move past the hateful, ugly rhetoric of this campaign season. Our moral obligation to innocent victims of persecution demands it, and our national interest requires it. I urge all Senators to support the Refugee Protection Act of 2016.                                 ______                                       By
