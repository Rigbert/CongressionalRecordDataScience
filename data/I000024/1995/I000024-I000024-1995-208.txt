One of the Senator's statements was that the defining difference, the budget that is adopted in the debate that will take place over the proposed budget that we have from the Republican side will be the defining difference between the two parties. And my question is, Is the Senator taking the budget, the President's budget as your budget and then the Domenici Republican budget as the other, as being the defining two budgets?
