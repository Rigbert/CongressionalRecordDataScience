Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee) for her very cogent comments, for her contribution to this body, and to enhancing the history of the contribution of African Americans to the House and to this country.  Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me thank the gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs. Capito) for her contribution to this debate and her participation in passing this resolution, and again to thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney), the chairman of the Committee on House Administration, and his staff for working so diligently to ensure the rapid passage of this resolution.
