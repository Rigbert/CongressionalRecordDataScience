There is good comradeship on the field, across the party lines. It is good fun. The Republicans had a great game, particularly early on. They got way ahead of us. We tried to catch up and could not do it, but it was a fun evening.  Mr. Speaker, the Bowie Bay Sox, a Double A team in the Baltimore Oriole organization, and the Bay Sox Stadium located in Bowie, Maryland, in my district, has been the host of this ball game over the last 6 or 7 years. It is a great little stadium, one of the best minor league stadiums, I think, in the country. It is a fun place to play, but it is approximately 25, 30 minutes from here and, with traffic, a longer period of time.  As the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Oxley), the manager of the Republican team, has pointed out, we had double the crowd, maybe even more than double the crowd, the largest crowd in our history, and the beneficiaries, of course, are the children and the families and the institutions that benefited from the contributions made by the people who attended and by those sponsors who generously provided resources to support this game.  I want to congratulate the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Oxley). I know on behalf of the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Sabo), the Democratic manager for many, many years who is not on the floor, I want to congratulate him and all of our players as well. It is a fun evening. It is a good evening. We congratulate the winners.  We are out recruiting very heavily. We used to recruit people who we thought would be good Members of Congress. We have slightly changed our focus. We are trying to get some good ball players. But we will work at it.                          ____________________
