Speaker, it is my great pleasure to congratulate Mt. Zion Baptist Church in Hammond, IN, as it prepares to celebrate its 78th anniversary on Sunday, November 16, 1997. I would also like to take this opportunity to commend Rev. Doctor A.R. Burns and the members of 78th Anniversary Committee, Yvonne Alexander, Shirley Sheppard, Ruby Peppers, Paul Lewis, Leo Harwell, and Jennifer Collins, for the hard work they have put forth in organizing this special event. The anniversary festivities will begin with a church service at 4 p.m., and will feature an exciting program of guest speakers.  A church of very modest beginnings, Mt. Zion was founded in 1919 by a group of Christian believers who desired to establish Hammond's first African-American Baptist Church. The African-American population in Hammond was small at that time, however, and the few people who began the church had meager resources. Therefore, a small, rented storefront building became the first home of the Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church. The parishioners worshiped at this humble location for several months under the leadership of Reverend Phelps of Gary, IN.  As its parishioners experienced financial difficulties brought about by a lack of job opportunity in Hammond, Mt. Zion struggled to support a minister and find an adequate place of worship. As a result, the church was moved to several locations and was led by a variety of pastors. However, in spite of the trials they faced, the small group of parishioners continued to grow and prosper. Within a year of its founding, Mr. Zion had already established a senior choir and became officially organized by Reverend Jackson of Indianapolis, IN. In 1921, Rev. William Davis, of Morgan Park, IL, became pastor of Mt. Zion, and he brought with him a vision of a larger, revitalized parish. Although Reverend Davis passed away in October of 1945, he donated the first $25 toward a $4,000 building fund, and, thus, laid the groundwork for the young minister, Rev. A.R. Burns, to fulfill his dream.  Reverend Burns, who began his pastorship at Mt. Zion in December of 1945, led the parish in purchasing lots for a new church at 1027 Kenwood Street. In 1949, the parish moved from the basement structure they had been occupying for several years to the new Mt. Zion church, which then became known as ``The Friendly Place of Worship.'' In addition to fulfilling Reverend Davis' dream, Reverend Burns followed his own dream of establishing a quality housing facility for the elderly. This dream became a reality in 1983, as a beautiful $6 million, seven-story, 128-unit building was completed at 940 Kenwood Street. The first tenants moved into the Mt. Zion Pleasant View Plaza in June 1983.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating the Mt. Zion Missionary Baptist Church parishioners as they prepare to celebrate the 78th anniversary of their parish. The many obstacles the Mt. Zion congregation has overcome to successfully guide and serve others in its community is truly inspirational.                          ____________________
