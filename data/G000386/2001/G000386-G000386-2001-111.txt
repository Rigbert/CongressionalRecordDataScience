 President, I yield myself the remaining time.  There are three things to remember:  Remember that the union members working this issue for the Treasury Department to make sure the Government's work is done right and done on time said it is very important that these notices be mailed out. That letter is a matter of record and is printed in the Record.  No. 2, remember that Congress ordered these letters to be sent. It is a conference report from which I have already quoted. But remember we said that.  No. 3, these letters are already printed and in the envelopes. There was a lot of labor put into this process. There was a lot of effort put into it. If you want to waste that money, you waste that money by voting for this amendment.  I yield the remainder of my time.
