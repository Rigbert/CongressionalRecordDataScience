Our economy isn't broken; it is strong. This budget will continue our economic growth as a nation. In this budget I can say to my children and grandchildren: We are doing the right thing. We are reducing the debt of the Nation so that your burden is reduced as well. We are providing for Social Security so that this Senator and many others, when it comes time for retirement, will have Social Security to turn to. A strong Medicare will be there as well. We are going to invest in our future in terms of education, health care, the things Americans value, and provide tax cuts targeted for middle- and low-income families to deal with long-term care expenses as well as college education expenses and the other burdens they face.  I challenge my friends on the other side of the aisle, in the true spirit of this deliberative body, to come forward with a better budget. Let's debate it on the floor. I am prepared to say at this moment that the principles behind the President's budget are principles I endorse. They are principles I think most of the American families endorse.  I yield the floor.
