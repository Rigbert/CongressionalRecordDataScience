Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to announce that the God First Ministries East Chicago, Indiana Chapter will be hosting a heavenly breakfast on Saturday, September 18, 2004, at the Dynasty Banquets Hall, in Hammond, Indiana.  This year's guest speaker, Dr. Mildred C. Harris, is one of the most caring, dedicated, and selfless citizens of Illinois. Dr. Harris graduated from DePaul University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Human Development with an emphasis on Communication Science. She then obtained a Master of Arts degree from Governors State University, a Master of Arts degree in Pastoral Studies from Loyola University, and a Doctorate in Ministry from the International Bible Institute and Seminary. Dr. Harris also holds two honorary doctorate degrees.  Dr. Harris has demonstrated a sincere love for the community in which she lives. In addition to improving the lives of others through her professional career as a retired school teacher, Dr. Harris is an ordained minister. She is the President and CEO of God First Ministries in Chicago, Illinois, and she has also established other God First Chapters in the states of California, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. Dr. Harris was selected as one of the 6 leading ministers from the City of Chicago to participate in the Chicago Remembers September 11th Observance in leading the Prayer of Hope for Chicago. She has also volunteered her time to champion many causes aimed at bringing comfort to those in need of assistance. Under her leadership, God First Ministries has fed thousands of people, given scholarships to graduating high school seniors, and hosted a clothing drive in which 21,000 clothing items were distributed to those in need.  Among her many contributions to the care of all people, Dr. Harris is a member of several boards and organizations, including: the Independent Assemblies of God, the National Religious Conference Management Association, the Administration Interacting with Ministers/Concerned Clergy for a Better Chicago, African American Religious Connection, the United Negro College Fund Advisory Board, Chicago Department on Aging Task Force, Women's Board of the Goodman Theatre, and the Local Government Advisory Board for the state of Illinois.  Although she dedicates her life to serving her community, Mildred never limits the time she gives to her loving family. She is the daughter of the late Dr. and Mrs. Jordan Clopton and she is married to Dr. Herbert C. Harris.  For all of her conscientious efforts, both professionally and voluntarily, Dr. Harris has been recognized by her peers by earning numerous awards for excellence. She has authored three books and was awarded the Popular Music Award from the American Society of Composers. Dr. Harris was also featured on billboards and busses throughout Chicago promoting a citywide organ donation drive. In 2000, she was awarded the Woman of the Year Award from the American Biographical Institute. She was then honored with the Dominick's Fresh Spirit Award as one of Chicago's Leading Women Religious Leaders in 2001. Dr. Harris was also featured in the Religious Conference Management Association, Who's Who 2002-2003.  Mr. Speaker, throughout Dr. Harris's career in ministry she has touched the lives of many around the world. Her unselfish and lifelong dedication to those in need is worthy of the highest recommendation. I am proud to commend her for her lifetime of service and dedication.                          ____________________
