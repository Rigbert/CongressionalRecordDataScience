President, as a member of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, I am concerned with the need for further research for a cure for diabetes. Recently, I had several meetings with constituents from Portland, Eugene, and Lake Oswego, Oregon concerning diabetes research funding. All of these constituents are young children or young adults living with this disease. One young woman told me that she has already lost three friends to this disease.  For fiscal year 2000, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) received a $13.3 million increase over last year's funding for diabetes. This increase brings the total amount for diabetes research to $462.3 million. For those who have to live every day with diabetes and for those who are the parents of a child living with disease, and who have to worry every day about the long-term toll diabetes disease takes on their child, this is not enough.  Diabetes can destroy nerves, harm eyesight, and cause a host of other deleterious effects on the body. While I am pleased that there was an increase in the funding of NIH for diabetes research last year, I believe we can and should do more to assure that we find a cure.  While funding has increased from $134 million in fiscal year 1980, this only represents approximately 2 percent growth per year when adjusted for inflation. Considering the widespread and devastating effects of this disease, we should continue to support the funding increases for NIH research of diabetes.  I know that many of my colleagues feel strongly about this issue as well. Ihope we can work in a bipartisan manner to assure an increase in research funding to find a cure.                          ____________________
