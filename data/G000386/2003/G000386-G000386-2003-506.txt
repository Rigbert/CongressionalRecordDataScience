 President, the way to make sure the American people are not buying a pig in a poke is to get more money in the pockets of the taxpayers so that there is less money around here for 535 Members of Congress to play with.  I want to speak in regard to this amendment; that the complete substitute will cut back our efforts to reduce marginal rates for families and small businesses.  In addition, the bill will make millions of taxpayers subject to the alternative minimum tax.  I appreciate the Senator's efforts on the child tax, and we already have a $95 billion child tax credit.  We also have significant State aid in the bill.  We have a point of order, as we have had before on an amendment like this.  I raise that point of order--that the language is not germane to the measure now before the Senate. The point of order is under section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act.
