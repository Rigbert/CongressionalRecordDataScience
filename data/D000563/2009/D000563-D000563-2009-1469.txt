President, I rise today to reintroduce the Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Foundation Act.  This year marks the 200th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's birth. We will spend this bicentennial year reflecting on Lincoln's legacy, a legacy that extends far beyond the Civil War. President Lincoln strove to democratize higher education. He enacted the Morrill Act, establishing public land grant universities and opening the doors to a college education to more Americans.  As we recognize Lincoln's legacy this year, we can again transform higher education. Today with Senator Wicker I am introducing the Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Foundation Act, which has the potential to equip a new generation of Americans with the skills to live in a globalized world.  The bill is named after the late Senator Paul Simon, a man whose passion for the public good remains an inspiration to all who knew him. Shortly before his death in late 2003, Senator Simon came back to Washington to talk to his former colleagues about the need to strengthen American security. He wondered how the United States could lead the world to stability, peace, and harmony when so many Americans are ignorant of the world. He envisioned a United States populated by a generation of Americans with greater international understanding--an understanding arrived at not by just studying the world, but by living in it. He believed this study abroad initiative would be as transformative as Lincoln's work to expand access to college.  Paul's tireless efforts led to Congress' establishment of the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Commission. I was honored to serve on this bipartisan Lincoln Commission, and it was a privilege for me to introduce legislation in the past two Congresses tobring Paul Simon's dream closer to reality. The bill is based on the Commission's recommendations for a study abroad program for undergraduate students that will help build global awareness and international understanding. In the last Congress, this bill was supported by 50 bipartisan cosponsors.  The Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Foundation Act has big goals. It declares our intention to send one million students abroad per year within the next decade. More of those students will study in the developing world and the students we send will be more diverse in terms of race, socioeconomic background, and field of study. To accomplish these goals, a small public-private entity, the Senator Paul Simon Foundation, will award grants to students and institutions of higher education. The goal of the program is to make study abroad in high-quality programs in diverse locations around the world more common for all college students. Grants to colleges and universities will be used to encourage tearing down institutional barriers to study abroad. By leveraging change at the institution level, the Foundation will create opportunities for countless students--far more than possible through direct student grants alone.  Expanding study abroad should be a national priority. The future of the country depends on globally literate citizens who are at ease in the world. In his troubled time, Lincoln said, ``The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew.'' Today, our Nation also faces an occasion piled high with difficulty. By passing the Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Foundation Act, we will send the next generation of Americans out into the world with open minds and they will come back able to think anew and act anew. I ask my colleagues to join Senator Wicker and me in support of this important legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 473         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives      of the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Senator Paul Simon Study      Abroad Foundation Act of 2009''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) According to former President George W. Bush,      ``America's leadership and national security rest on our      commitment to educate and prepare our youth for active      engagement in the international community.''.       (2) According to former President William J. Clinton,      ``Today, the defense of United States interests, the      effective management of global issues, and even an      understanding of our Nation's diversity require ever-greater      contact with, and understanding of, people and cultures      beyond our borders.''.       (3) Congress authorized the establishment of the Commission      on the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program      pursuant to section 104 of the Miscellaneous Appropriations      and Offsets Act, 2004 (division H of Public Law 108-199).      Pursuant to its mandate, the Lincoln Commission has submitted      to Congress and the President a report of its recommendations      for greatly expanding the opportunity for students at      institutions of higher education in the United States to      study abroad, with special emphasis on studying in developing      nations.       (4) According to the Lincoln Commission, ``[s]tudy abroad      is one of the major means of producing foreign language      speakers and enhancing foreign language learning'' and, for      that reason, ``is simply essential to the [N]ation's      security''.       (5) Studies consistently show that United States students      score below their counterparts in other advanced countries on      indicators of international knowledge. This lack of global      literacy is a national liability in an age of global trade      and business, global interdependence, and global terror.       (6) Americans believe that it is important for their      children to learn other languages, study abroad, attend a      college where they can interact with international students,      learn about other countries and cultures, and generally be      prepared for the global age.       (7) In today's world, it is more important than ever for      the United States to be a responsible, constructive leader      that other countries are willing to follow. Such leadership      cannot be sustained without an informed citizenry with      significant knowledge and awareness of the world.       (8) Study abroad has proven to be a very effective means of      imparting international and foreign-language competency to      students.       (9) In any given year, only approximately one percent of      all students enrolled in United States institutions of higher      education study abroad.       (10) Less than 10 percent of the students who graduate from      United States institutions of higher education with bachelors      degrees have studied abroad.       (11) Far more study abroad must take place in developing      countries. Ninety-five percent of the world's population      growth over the next 50 years will occur outside of Europe.      Yet in the academic year 2004-2005, 60 percent of United      States students studying abroad studied in Europe, and 45      percent studied in four countries--the United Kingdom, Italy,      Spain, and France--according to the Institute of      International Education.       (12) The Final Report of the National Commission on      Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (The 9/11 Commission      Report) recommended that the United States increase support      for ``scholarship, exchange, and library programs''. The 9/11      Public Discourse Project, successor to the 9/11 Commission,      noted in its November 14, 2005, status report that this      recommendation was ``unfulfilled,'' and stated that ``[t]he      U.S. should increase support for scholarship and exchange      programs, our most powerful tool to shape attitudes over the      course of a generation.''. In its December 5, 2005, Final      Report on the 9/11 Commission Recommendations, the 9/11      Public Discourse Project gave the government a grade of ``D''      for its implementation of this recommendation.       (13) Investing in a national study abroad program would      help turn a grade of ``D'' into an ``A'' by equipping United      States students to communicate United States values and way      of life through the unique dialogue that takes place among      citizens from around the world when individuals study abroad.       (14) An enhanced national study abroad program could help      further the goals of other United States Government      initiatives to promote educational, social, and political      reform and the status of women in developing and reforming      societies around the world, such as the Middle East      Partnership Initiative.       (15) To complement such worthwhile Federal programs and      initiatives as the Benjamin A. Gilman International      Scholarship Program, the National Security Education Program,      and the National Security Language Initiative, a broad-based      undergraduate study abroad program is needed that will make      many more study abroad opportunities accessible to all      undergraduate students, regardless of their field of study,      ethnicity, socio-economic status, or gender.       (16) To restore America's standing in the world, President      Barack Obama has said that he will call on our nation's      greatest resource, our people, to reach out to and engage      with other nations.     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.       The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to significantly enhance the global competitiveness and      international knowledge base of the United States by ensuring      that more United States students have the opportunity to      acquire foreign language skills and international knowledge      through significantly expanded study abroad;       (2) to enhance the foreign policy capacity of the United      States by significantly expanding and diversifying the talent      pool of individuals with non-traditional foreign language      skills and cultural knowledge in the United States who are      available for recruitment by United States foreign affairs      agencies, legislative branch agencies, and nongovernmental      organizations involved in foreign affairs activities;       (3) to ensure that an increasing portion of study abroad by      United States students will take place in nontraditional      study abroad destinations such as the People's Republic of      China, countries of the Middle East region, and developing      countries; and       (4) to create greater cultural understanding of the United      States by exposing foreign students and their families to      United States students in countries that have not      traditionally hosted large numbers of United States students.
