President, I have 2 or 3 more questions. I have a copy of OASIS. This is not relief. I understand the time requirements. I want you to look at this. This OASIS document includes an 18-page initial assessment that must be completed by a registered nurse, and a 13-page follow-up assessment that is required every 60 days. This is perpetual reporting, a perpetual reporting machine, well-boiled by HCFA. And this is on top of assessments already required by States. The paperwork burden is immense. I am curious about what is included in this assessment. Is the Senator aware of the nature of the questions in this assessment?  I think I know the answer. I have read through this OASIS--the third degree, or whatever you want to call it. Will the Senator speak to the nature of the questions in the assessment?
