Chairman, I would ask to be recognized.  Mr. Chairman, I will not concede the issue of relief being necessary for the domestic steel industry. I would concede that the amendment that was offered here today is violative of the rule we are operating under. I would simply want to withdraw that amendment.  Before I do that, I want to sincerely thank the chairman of the full committee, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young); I want to thank my chairman on the Subcommittee on Defense, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lewis); as well as the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), who managed the time, for the courtesy in allowing us to keep this very important issue before this institution and the American people.  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.
