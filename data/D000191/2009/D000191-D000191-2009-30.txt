The funding is there. Yes, some money was transferred this summer to make up for past expenditures for emergencies and other things from the trust fund, but we would not be borrowing any money to extend this program for the next 3 months. It will be paid for, and it would put a heck of a lot of people to work. The bottom line is, do you vote ``yes'', extend this critical $4.5 billion investment next month in our transportation infrastructure, keeping our transit systems running? Or do you vote ``no'' and bring it to a screeching halt?
