Chairman, reclaiming my time, and I said as I spoke, the objectives of the K-V Fund are meritorious. The question is how much goes to overhead? And I would say that 25 percent where they are attributing rent for a Forest Service employee who works in a ranger's station, attributing all of those, if we add up all the overheads and the indirects we find that in part it is going to the chief's salary. It is going here because the chief spends 4 percent of his time on K-V Fund, so 4 percent of his salary.  I mean, when we add them up, they do not add up to 100 percent. So my concern is that we are not getting as much money on the ground as we should. I certainly would not want to get an unintended effect here which would be to deprive them of any capability of managing and investing these funds. But I think the gentleman from California (Mr. Miller) is trying to make the point that the 25 percent number is arbitrary and too high.
