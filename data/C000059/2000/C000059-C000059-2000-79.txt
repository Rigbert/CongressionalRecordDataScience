Speaker, I rise today to strongly support this important law enforcement legislation. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the original Aimee's Law and legislation, and have voted on this provision in the juvenile justice bill earlier this year.  Those who prey on innocent children do not deserve repeated opportunities for freedom. This bill, also known as the No Second Chances for Murderers, Rapists, and Child Molesters Act of 1999, would encourage States to increase penalties for serious violent crimes by calling for murderers to receive the death penalty or be imprisoned for life without possibility of parole.  Those convicted of rape or dangerous sexual offenses involving a child under the age of 14 would be imprisoned for life without the possibility of parole. This legislation finally will assist local law enforcement officials by ensuring that the most dangerous criminals will not be released back to the streets to commit more deadly crimes.  Mr. Speaker, I firmly believe that we must take all necessary actions to help protect the innocent from predatory violent criminals. I believe that Aimee's Law significantly helps achieve this goal. I encourage all my colleagues to support this legislation, and thank my friend, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Salmon) for introducing this bill. I encourage its passage.
