 President, right outside this Chamber stands a statue of Ben Franklin. According to the Office of the Senate Curator, sculptor Hiram Powers received a contract from President James Buchanan himself to sculpt Franklin back in 1859. The statue arrived in the Capitol in 1862 and has been in that spot ever since.  Franklin wrote many famous aphorisms that live on to this day, and I wanted to talk about one of my favorites.  Two hundred eighteen years ago today, Franklin wrote to a friend words that will long outlive mostthings we say. This is what Franklin had to say:       Nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.  Proving the aphorism, Franklin died less than a year later.  While we know the certainty of death and taxes, we can do something to ease the burden for the 23 million Americans who will be in for a rather unpleasant surprise on April 15 if Congress doesn't act now to stop the middle-class tax hike, which goes by the rather innocuous name of AMT--a law that was originally intended in 1969 to impose taxes on a handful of high-income individuals who used loopholes in the code to avoid paying any regular income tax.  Congress has known about the need to fix this problem all year long, but the majority hasn't brought a bill to the floor. Now they say it will be December before a bill is brought to the floor.  Now, the consequences of mismanaging this stealth tax are very real. This tax will grab $65 billion out of the pockets of middle-class taxpayers, an average of $2,000 per family. Millions will be hit for the very first time.  The IRS sent a letter warning the majority that unless they act before December, the tax returns of 50 million people and $75 billion in tax refunds will be delayed.  Last week, Democrats in the House of Representatives passed a bill that purports to delay the burden of the AMT for 1 year by socking a massive $80 billion tax increase to the American people. That is the last thing they need right now, and it would be a disastrous jolt to the economy.  Maybe a massive tax hike wrapped in an AMT fix sounds like a very good idea to some people, but I have a message to anyone who thinks that: Such a proposal is dead on arrival in the Senate.  The AMT was never meant to be collected from the millions of Americans whom it will hit this year if we don't act. I say this Congress ought to cut taxes by cutting taxes--cut taxes by cutting taxes--not by raising taxes.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
