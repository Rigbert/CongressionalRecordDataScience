 President, I rise today to introduce a resolution that honors one of the most venerable institutions in our State: the University of California.  The resolution before us commemorates the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the University of California, a noteworthy milestone that must be celebrated by recognizing all of the achievements. I would like to thank my dear friend, Senator Harris, for joining me and supporting this endeavor.  Throughout its history, the University of California has become a foundation, and a beacon of hope, for the State of California and the Nation as a whole. It embraces the same spirit and tenacity that defines our great State.  The University of California has grown from one campus in Berkeley to a system of 10 top-ranked universities, five notable and top-notch academic medical centers, and three affiliated National Laboratories, all impacting far reaches of the State.  We should recognize the University of California for what it is: the finest and most accessible public university system in this country. It was established on the premise that college is for everyone and designed with every Californian in mind. That is why the University of California's Board of Regents in 1870 decreed that women be admitted equally with men, 50 years before the adoption of the Nineteenth Amendment, which granted women the right to vote.  Diversity has always been a cornerstone of the University of California. Because of its progressive and forward-thinking ways, notable alumni include Jackie Robinson, who shattered the Major League Baseball's color barrier; Sally Ride, the first American woman in space; and the countless number of students and faculty members who are the first generation in their families to attend college.  Today, the University of California has more than 273,000 enrolled students and employs more than 223,300 faculty, staff, and other academics. It has graduated more than two million living alumni.  The University of California is also a national leader in scientific discovery and medical advancement, enabling transformational solutions for healthcare and the environment, enhancing our Nation's defense while reducing the global threat from terrorism, and addressing other emerging national security and energy challenges. It established itself in the fields of nuclear physics and biotechnology, revolutionized agriculture, and helped the movie industry mature, all of which are now multi-billion-dollar industries. Through its faculty and alumni, the University continues to drive technological innovation and actively partner with the private sector.  Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I would like to end with a small anecdote. Every year in our household, we always look forward to the ``Big Game.'' For the uninitiated, this is the biggest college football game of the year: the Stanford Cardinal versus the California Golden Bears. This is the oldest college football rivalry in the West, which began in 1892, and still continues to this day. I do not hold it against those who attended Berkeley, but I will be happy to gloat when my Cardinal beat the Bears. I am not one to boast, but it must be noted that Stanford has won more ``Big Games'' than Berkeley.  All quips aside, as we commemorate this momentous occasion in the storied history that is the University of California, we must remember the past and present, with an eye towards the future. The challenges before it are great, but the potential that lies within itself is even greater. I know and believe that the University of California will continue to push boundaries, explore the great unknown, stand up for American values, and continue to solve the world's most complex problems. Here is to another exceptional 150 years.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
