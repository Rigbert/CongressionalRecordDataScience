 She has developed business plans and goals, written software for farm accounting, spoken numerous times at agricultural seminars on various agriculture topics, and has authored a book on putting paperwork in its place. She also serves on board of the Farm Bureau Mutual Fund. She has an admirable record of public service to the State of Iowa, having served as a member of the board of regents, which oversees Iowa's three State universities. Currently, Ann is a board member of the Iowa Department of Economic Development. The list goes on extensively.  Once the administration formally nominates Ms. Jorgenson and the Agriculture Committee has an opportunity to review her record and qualifications, I am convinced that the Senator will conclude that she is a highly qualified person for the position.
