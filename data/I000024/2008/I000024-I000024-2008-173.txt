President, let me respond, firstly, if I can, to the assistant majority leader. First, it is easy to point the finger at oil companies. That is the easiest ``out,'' because everyone has this perception that all oil companies are doing great.  Here is the problem you have. If you were to take all profits from oil companies--let's forget about windfall profits; take it all, do not leave any at all for anything else, other than what they are putting into exploration--it would amount to 28 cents a gallon.  If you slashed their profits in half, as they are proposing to do, that would be 14 cents. Fourteen cents does not help a lot, at least my wife says it does not. And I think you know we are kidding ourselves.
