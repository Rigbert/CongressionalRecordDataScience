 President, on an entirely different matter, the Senate voted yesterday to advance the nomination of Bernard McNamee to serve on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Today, we will vote on his confirmation. I encourage every one of my colleagues to join me in supporting this abundantly well-qualified nominee.  After Mr. McNamee, we will continue moving ahead with the personnel business. We will vote on the confirmation of Kathleen Kraninger to lead the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. Ms. Kraninger brings a wealth of experience to an Agency in need of a renewed, consumer-focused mission. I urge each of my colleagues to join me in voting to get her started in this important work.                          ____________________
