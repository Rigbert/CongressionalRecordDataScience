  The Schumer amendment, as I said so many times, fractures the spirit of the bipartisan compromise that occurred in the Senate Finance Committee, which is the reason we can be here doing things in the tradition of the Finance Committee in a bipartisan way.  Of course, Senator Schumer has no interest in this bipartisan agreement. It is curious that Senator Schumer would want to work so hard in offering an amendment to improve, in his mind, a bill he is going to end up voting against.  Senator Schumer's amendment guarantees that the Federal Government gets to take over 50 percent of the assets a parent wants to pass on to a child. That does not sound like taxation; that sounds like confiscation to me.  Senator Schumer claims that his amendment improves the education components in this bill, but in fact the bill's underlying education provisions are sound. Student loan interest deduction, prepaid tuition plans, employer-provided educational assistance, an increase in the education IRA--these are all important measures that will improve access to education.  Senator Schumer's amendment will undo a very delicate compromise upon which these provisions rest. It is unwise, it is destructive, and it also should be defeated.  I yield to the Senator from Arizona.
