Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Friends of Jefferson Patterson Park and Museum. This organization received a 2003 Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network Grant for a project designed to enhance opportunities for visitors to explore the lands and stories of Jefferson Patterson Park and Museum.  The Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network, which includes more than 120 museums, state parks, wildlife refugees and other sites in five states and the District of Columbia, was created to enhance the experience of visitors tothe Chesapeake Bay and its many roads, rivers and trails. Authorized by the Chesapeake Bay Initiative Act of 1998, the Gateways Network is coordinated by the National Park Service in partnership with the Chesapeake Bay Program.  During the past four years, Gateways Network Grants have funded new maps, improved signs, and expanded trails that have made visits to parks, wildlife refuges and water trails even more exciting and enjoyable than they had previously been. These grants help enhance the public's ability to learn and enjoy the Chesapeake's stories and significance, explore its natural and cultural resources, and become involved in helping conserve and restore the Bay and its watershed. Through these projects and other Gateways Network efforts more and more people recognize the Chesapeake as a true national treasure.  In 2003, the National Park Service is awarding $1,387,309 in grant funding, matched by over $2 million in partner contributions. Thirty-two grants are being made to Gateways throughout the Bay watershed in Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia. The Friends of Jefferson Patterson Park and Museum is receiving a grant of $41,400 and $62,563 in partner contributions.  The project proposed by the Friends of Jefferson Patterson Park and Museum will extend the Shoreline Loop Trail to 3.75 miles, adding to 50 percent to its length, and resulting in the longest publicly accessible shoreline in Calvert County, Maryland. Greater public access to the Patuxent River will help people enjoy this scenic Chesapeake Bay tributary. A trail map and guide will be prepared and a series of wayside exhibit panels will also be added along the trail to interpret the environment and the diverse cultures that have influenced this site over time. The park will also develop an overall interpretive plan for the park to guide both this project and all future interpretive efforts.  Mr. Speaker, it is with the assistance and vision of organizations such as the Friends of Jefferson Patterson Park and Museum that the Chesapeake Bay and the entire region has become the treasure that we know it to be today. Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating the Friends of Jefferson Patterson Park and Museum on receiving this grant and wishing them the best of luck in completing their project.                          ____________________
