President, I join Senator Lieberman in commending Senator McCain for offering this amendment. It would make several changes to the Presidential transition process, changes that are consistent with the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission.  The Governmental Affairs Subcommittee, chaired by Senator Voinovich, held a hearing on this issue at which two of the Commissioners, Fred Fielding and Jamie Gorelick, discussed how the current transition process does not serve our country well in the handing over, the transitioning of important national security decisions from one administration to another. One reason is that it is such a slow process to get the new administration's team in place.  I believe this amendment would greatly improve the process. I know of no opposition to it. I urge adoption of the amendment.
