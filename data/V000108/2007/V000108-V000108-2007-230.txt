On Friday, June 8, 2007, the Plumbers Local Union 210 will honor the graduating class of 2007 at the Annual Apprentice Graduation Banquet, which will be held at the Patio Banquet Hall in Merrillville, IN.  At this year's banquet, the Plumbers Local Union 210 will recognize and honor the 2007 Apprentice Graduates. The individuals who have completed the apprentice training in 2007 are: Kraig Bailey, Daniel Borowski, Micah Dolatowski, Steven Frederick, Michael Martin, Jr., Timothy Matson, Charles Standifer, Rickey Thomas, and Dustin Werner.  Northwest Indiana has a rich history of excellence in its craftsmanship and loyalty by its tradesmen. These graduates are all outstanding examples of each. They have mastered their trade and have demonstrated their loyalty to both the union and the community through their hard work and selfless dedication.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating these dedicated and hardworking individuals. Along with the other men and women of northwest Indiana's unions, these individuals have committed themselves to making a significant contribution to the growth and development of the economy of the First Congressional District, and I am very proud to represent them in Washington, DC.                          ____________________
