President, many good reasons have been stated on the floor for the passage of this important legislation. I hold in my hand convincing evidence. It is an unsolicited e-mail sent to my Senate computer a few weeks ago. It boasts that they will offer for me to purchase 500 different bootleg video games from a person who says in this solicitation, ``All the games I sell are pirated. I do not sell originals.'' This business is operating across the United States, Canada, England, Australia, and claims to trade copies made in Hong Kong.  When you think of the importance of intellectual property to America's exports and the importance of this business in terms of the United States and the world, it is clear that we need this legislation to stop this type of flagrant abuse, which I received and I am sure many others could receive if they surf the Internet.  I commend Senators Hatch, Leahy, Ashcroft, and so many others. I urge its unanimous passage and yield the remainder of my time.
