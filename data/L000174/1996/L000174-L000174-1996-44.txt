In Italian, it means society of mutual aid. But for my Italian immigrant grandfather who worked in the granite quarries of Barre and South Ryegate, VT, it meant much, much more.  It meant financial security in the days before Social Security and Medicare. It meant affordable health care when they could not afford health insurance. It meant they had a second family when their families were thousands of miles away in their homeland. To Peter and Vincenza Zambon, my grandparents, Mutuo Soccorso meant the Mutuo Club of Barre, VT.  Mr. President, I am proud to celebrate the 90th birthday of the Mutuo Club, the Italian-American club of central Vermont. Since 1906, the Mutuo Club has represented the finest values of our immigrant heritage--a special sense of community and friendship.  The Mutuo Club was first established as an offspring of the old society clubs in Italy during the 19th century. Members of the Mutuo paid so much a week into a common fund to help when they and their families got sick. The Mutuo fund helped pay the doctor and hospitalbills. Members of the Mutuo pulled together to help each other. Each member was in effect his brother's keeper.  When my grandfather came to Vermont from Italy, he went to the granite quarries to earn a modest living. Life was not easy--tough work, low pay, and health hazards. But in this foreign land, he had the Mutuo Club as a special community to share friendships in good times and a helping hand in bad times.  I remember as a small child walking with my grandfather down the streets of downtown Barre. He would often stop in the street to visit with fellow Mutuo Club members. They would tell stories, plan to help each other, or just learn the latest joke. I remember sensing a special bond of community and friendship between my grandfather and the other Italian-Americans of the Mutuo Club.  Now, the Mutuo Club is open to Americans of all nationalities. And that same special bond of community and friendship enjoyed by my grandfather is still shared by members of the Mutuo Club today.  Mr. President, the Mutuo Club is a living tribute to that special bond. In celebrating the Mutuo Club's 90th birthday, we celebrate that special sense of community and friendship shared by the Mutuo Club members of yesterday, today, and tomorrow.                          ____________________
