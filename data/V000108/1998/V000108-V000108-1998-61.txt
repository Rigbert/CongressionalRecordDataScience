Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to engage the gentleman from Minnesota in a colloquy. I would say to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar), is it the intent of the conferees that the authorization for section 332(a)(96), the Westlake Corridor Commuter Rail Link, include authorization for the acquisition of eight commuter rail cars for the South Shore Railroad?
