Speaker, here is the latest reality game. Let's play Wall Street Bailout.  Rule one: Rush the decision. Time the game to fall in the week before Congress is set to adjourn and just 6 weeks before an historic election so your opponents will be preoccupied, pressured, distracted, and in a hurry.  Rule two: Disarm the public through fear. Warn that the entire global financial system will collapse and the world will fall into another Great Depression. Control the media enough to ensure that the public will not notice this.  Bailout will indebt them for generations, taking from them trillions of dollars they earned and deserve to keep.  Rule three: Control the playing field and set the rules. Hide from the public and most of the Congress just who is arranging this deal. Communicate with the public through leaks to media insiders. Limit any open congressional hearings. Communicate with Congress via private teleconferencing calls. Heighten political anxiety by contacting each political party separately. Treat Members of Congress condescendingly, telling them that the matter is so complex that they must rely on those few insiders who really do know what's going on.  Rule four: Divert attention and keep people confused. Manage the news cycle so Congress and the public have no time to examine who destroyed the prudent banking system that served America so well for 60 years after the financial meltdown of the 1920s.  Rule five: Always keep in mind the goal is to privatize gains to a few and socialize loss to the many. For 30 years in one financial scandal after another, Wall Street game masters have kept billions of dollars of their gain and shifted their losses to American taxpayers. Once this bailout is in place, the greed game will begin again.  But I have a counter-game. It's called Wall Street Reckoning. Congress shouldn't go home to campaign. It should put America's accounts in order.                              {time}  1930  To Wall Street insiders, it says ``no'' on behalf of the American people. You have perpetrated the greatest financial crimes ever on this American republic. You think you can get by with it because you are extraordinarily wealthy and the largest contributors to both Presidential and congressional campaigns in both major parties, but you are about to be brought under firm control.  First, America doesn't need to bail you out, it needs to secure the real assets and property, not your paper, that means the homes and properties of hardworking Americans who are about to lose their homes because of your mortgage greed. There should be a new job for regional Federal Reserve Banks. We want no home foreclosed if a serious work-out agreement can be put into place. And if you don't do it, we want a notarized statement by a Federal Reserve official that they tried and failed.  Second, taxpayers should directly gain any equity benefits that may flow from this historic bailout. We want the American people to get first priority in taking ownership of the institutions that want to pass their toxic paper onto the taxpayers.  Third, before any bailouts for Wall Street, America needs major job creation to rebuild our major infrastructure. America needs assets, not paper. We need working assets.  Fourth, the time for real financial regulatory change is now, not next year. A modernized Glass Eagle Act must be put in place. We need to reestablish locally-owned community savings banks across this country and create within the Justice Department a fully funded unit to prosecute every single high-flying thief whose fraud and criminal acts created this debacle and then forced their disgorgement of assets going back 15 years.  Fifth, any refinancing must return a major share of profits to a new Social Security and Medicare lockbox, where the monies can go to pay for a dignified and assured retirement for every American. This Member isn't voting for a penny of it. Those who created and profited from this game of games must be brought to justice. The assets they stole must be returned to the American taxpayers, right down to the tires on their Mercedes.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring my bill to create an independent commission to investigate these well-heeled wrongdoers. Real reform now, or nothing.     Seven Deadly Sins of Deregulation--and Three Necessary Reforms                          (By Robert Kuttner)       The current carnage on Wall Street, with dire spillover      effects on Main Street, is the result of a failed ideology--     the idea that financial markets could regulate themselves.      Serial deregulation fed on itself. Deliberate repeal of      regulations became entangled with failure to carry out laws      still on the books. Corruption mingled with simple      incompetence. And though the ideology was largely Republican,      it was abetted by Wall Street Democrats.       Why regulate? As we have seen ever since the sub-prime      market blew up in the summer of 2007, government cannot stand      by when a financial crash threatens to turn into a general      depression--even a government like the     Bush administration that fervently believes in free markets.      But if government must act to contain wider damage when large      banks fail, then it is obliged to act to prevent damage from      occurring in the first place. Otherwise, the result is what      economists term ``moral hazard''--an invitation to take      excessive risks.       Government, under Franklin Roosevelt, got serious about      regulating financial markets after the first cycle of      financial bubble and economic ruin in the 1920s. Then, as      now, the abuses were complex in their detail but very simple      in their essence. They included the sale of complex      securities packaged in deceptive and misleading ways; far too      much borrowing to finance speculative investments; and gross      conflicts of interest on the part of insiders who stood to      profit from flim-flams. When the speculative bubble burst in      1929, sellers overwhelmed buyers, many investors were wiped      out, and the system of credit contracted, choking the rest of      the economy.       In the 1930s, the Roosevelt administration acted to prevent      a repetition of the ruinous 1920s. Commercial banks were      separated from investment banks, so that bankers could not      prosper by underwriting bogus securities and foisting them on      retail customers. Leverage was limited in order to rein in      speculation with borrowed money. Investment banks, stock      exchanges, and companies that publicly traded stocks were      required to disclose more information to investors. Pyramid      schemes and conflicts of interest were limited. The system      worked very nicely until the 1970s--when financial innovators      devised end-runs around the regulated system, and regulators      stopped keeping up with them.                           Seven Deadly Sins       Sin One: Allowing Mortgage Lending to Become a Casino.      Until 1969, Fannie Mae was part of the government. Mortgage      lenders were tightly regulated. Homeownership rates soared      throughout the postwar era, from about 44 percent on the eve      of World War II to 64 percent by the mid-1960s. Nobody in the      mortgage business got filthy rich, and hardly anyone lost      money. Fannie's job was to buy mortgages from banks and      thrift institutions, to replenish their money to make      mortgages, and along the way to set standards. Fannie      financed its operations by selling bonds. In the late 1970s,      private Wall Street firms started emulating Fannie. They      packaged mortgages, and converted them into bonds. Over time,      their standards deteriorated, because they could make more      money creating riskier products. In order to avoid losing      market share, Fannie emulated some of the same abuses.      Government did not step in to regulate the affair--which was      a time bomb waiting for the creation of the sub-prime      mortgage business.       Sin Two: Allowing Unregulated Bond Rating Agencies to      Decide What was Safe. Sub-prime is only the best known of a      widespread fad known as ``securitization.'' The idea is to      turn loans into bonds. Bonds are given ratings by private      companies that have official government recognition, such as      Moody's and Standard and Poors, but no government regulation.      These rating agencies have become thoroughly corrupted by      conflicts of interest. If you want to package and sell bonds      backed by risky loans, you go to a bond-rating agency and pay      it a hefty fee. In return, the agency helps you manipulate      the bond so that it qualifies for a triple-A rating, even if      the underlying loans include many that are high-risk. Without      the collusion of the bond-rating agencies, sub-prime lending      never would have gotten off the ground, because it would not      have found a mass market. Had regulators looked inside this      black box, they would have shut it down. They might have      needed new legislation, but they never asked for it. And      public-minded regulators might have done a lot under existing      law, since banks (which are regulated) were heavily      implicated in the financing of sub-prime.       Sin Three: Failing to Police Sub-prime. The core idea of      bank regulation is that government inspectors periodically      examine the quality of bank assets. If too large a portion of      a bank's loan portfolio is behind in its interest payments,      the bank is made to raise more capital as a cushion against      losses. Problems are nipped in the bud. But complex      securities require more sophisticated regulation than simple      loans. Regulators basically waived the rule on adequate      capital for the new wave of mortgage lenders who created sub-     prime. Many mortgage companies were not banks. They made      loans only to sell them off to the Wall Street sinners of      Deadly Sin No. 1 (see above). So there was no loan portfolio      to examine, and no real capital. The Democratic Congress      anticipated this problem in 1994, when it passed the      Homeownership Opportunity and Equity Protection Act. This      prescient law required the Federal Reserve to regulate the      loan-origination standards of mortgage companies that were      not otherwise government-regulated. But Alan Greenspan, a      free-market zealot, never implemented the law. And when      Republicans took over Congress in 1995, they never called him      on the carpet.       Sin Four: Failure to Stop Excess Leverage. The financial      economy is crashing today because so much speculation was      done with borrowed money. A typical leverage ratio of a hedge      fund or private equity company is 30 to one. That means $30      of debt for $1 of actual capital. If you make one serious      miscalculation, you are out of business. And in the case of      sub-prime mortgage companies, the leverage ratio was      infinite, because they had no capital. The game was entirely      based on creating debt. As long as times were good, financial      firms could keep borrowing to finance their deals. But once      investors looked down, they panicked. Some parts of the      system are unregulated, such as hedge funds and private-     equity companies. But they all ultimately get a lot of their      funding from banks. And regulators do retain the power to      look closely at banks' books (see Sin No. 3 above). Had they      used that power to police the kind of highly risky stuff      banks were underwriting they could have shut it down.       Sin Five: Failure to Police Conflicts of Interest. Remember      the accounting scandals of the 1990s? In those scandals,      accounting firms were paid once to audit corporate books and      then again to help clients cook the books and still pass      muster with the audit. That was a sheer conflict of interest.      Though accountants were (loosely) regulated, Congress did not      crack down until cooked books caused the stock market to      crash. A second conflict of interest was the corruption of      stock analysts, who were telling customers to buy dubious      stocks because their bosses were profiting from underwriting      the same stocks. In the aftermath of the dot-com bust,      Congress narrowly cracked down on these two abuses with the      Sarbanes-Oxley Act but simply ignored others--such as the      role of bond-rating agencies and the habit of basing      executive bonuses on stock prices that could easily be      manipulated by the same executives.       Sin Six: Failing to Regulate Hedge Funds and Private      Equity. When Roosevelt's New Deal acted to rein in the abuses      in financial markets, it regulated the major players--     commercial banks, investment banks, stock brokers, holding      companies, and stock exchanges. But two of the biggest      purveyors of risk today--hedge funds and private-equity      firms--simply did not exist. Today, private-equity firms and      hedge funds do most of the things banks and investment banks      do. They basically create credit by making markets in exotic      securities. They buy and sell firms. They speculate in      financial markets with borrowed money, taking much bigger      risks than regulated banks. According to House Banking      Committee Chair Barney Frank, more than half the credit      created in recent years has been created by essentially      unregulated institutions. The people in charge of the      government--conservative Republicans--took the view that      these new-wave financial players offered transactions between      consenting adults who needed no special consumer protection.      But they were oblivious to the risks to the larger system.       Sin Seven: Repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act. This action,      in 1999, was one of two major cases when a cornerstone of New      Deal regulation was explicitly repealed. (The other was the      repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act, and if your      utility rates are sky-high, you can thank Congress for that,      too.) Glass-Steagall provided that if you wanted to speculate      as an investment bank, good luck to you. But commercial banks      were part of the banking system. They created credit. They      were regulated, supervised, usually enjoyed FDIC insurance,      and had access to advances from the Fed in emergencies. So      commercial banks and investment banks were two different      creatures that should stay out of each other's knitting.       But beginning in the 1980s, regulators who didn't believe      in regulation either allowed explicit waivers of some aspects      of Glass-Steagall or looked the other way as commercial banks      and investment banks became more alike. By 1999, when      Citigroup had jumped the gun and assembled a supermarket that      included a commercial bank, investment bank, stock brokerage,      and insurance company, Glass Steagall was so hollowed out      that it was effectively dead. The coup de grace was its      official repeal, in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. That's Gramm      as in former Sen. Phil Gramm, a deregulation zealot and top      adviser to John McCain.                          Three Basic Reforms       What all of these sins had in common was that they led      financial markets to misprice assets. In plain English, that      means buyers were purchasing securities based on bad      information, often with borrowed money. When firms started      losing money on sub-prime in mid-2007 and other owners      decided it was time to get their money out, the whole miracle      of leverage went into reverse. And it spilled over into other      securities that had been mispriced thanks to all the      conflicts of interest tolerated by regulators.       That's why, no matter how much taxpayer money the Federal      Reserve and the Treasury keep pumping in, they can't turn      dross back into gold. The next administration and the      Congress need to return the financial economy to its historic      task of supplying capital to the real economy--of connecting      investors to entrepreneurs--and shut down the purely casino      aspects of the system that have only enriched middlemen and      passed along huge risks to everyone else.       Reform One: If it Quacks Like a Bank, Regulate it Like a      Bank. Barack Obama said it well in his historic speech on the      financial emergency last March 27 in New York. ``We need to      regulate financial institutions for what they do, not what      they are.'' Increasingly, different kinds of financial firms      do the same kinds of things, and they are all capable of      infusing toxic products into the nation's financial      bloodstream. That's why Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson has      had to extend the government's financial safety net to all      kinds of large financial firms like     A.I.G. that have no technical right to the aid and no      regulation to keep them from taking outlandish risks. Going      forward, all financial firms that buy and sell products in      money markets need the same regulation and examination. That      will be the essence of the 2009 version of the Glass-Steagall      Act.       Reform Two: Limit Leverage. At the very heart of the      financial meltdown was extreme speculation with esoteric      financial securities, using astronomical rates of leverage.      Commercial banks are limited to something like 10 to one, or      less, depending on their conditions. These leverage limits      need to be extended to all financial players, as part of the      same 2009 banking reform.       Reform Three: Police Conflicts of Interest. The conflicts      of interest at the core of bond-raising agencies are only one      of the conflicts that have been permitted to pervade      financial markets. Bond-rating agencies should probably      become public institutions. Other conflicts of interest      should be made explicitly illegal. Yes, financial markets      keep ``innovating.'' But some innovations are good, and some      are abusive subterfuges. And if regulators who actually      believe in regulation are empowered to examine all financial      institutions, they can issue cease-and-desist orders when      they encounter dangerous conflicts.       We're talking about a Roosevelt-scale counterrevolution      here. But nothing less will prevent the financial collapse      from cascading into Great Depression II. And the public      should never again forget that this needless collapse was      brought to us by free-market extremists.                                  ____               [From Robert Reich's Blog, Sept. 21, 2008] What Wall Street Should Be Required To Do, To Get a Blank Check From                                Taxpayers                            (By Robert Reich)       The frame has been set, the dye cast. Treasury Secretary      Hank Paulson, presumably representing the Bush administration      but indirectly representing Wall Street, and Fed Chief Ben      Bernanke, want a blank check from Congress for $700 billion      or possibly a trillion dollars or more to take bad debt off      Wall Street's balance sheets. Never before in the history of      American capitalism has so much been asked of so many for (at      least in the first instance) so few.       Put yourself in the shoes of a member of Congress,      including our two presidential candidates. The Treasury      Secretary and Fed Chair have told you this is necessary to      save the economy. If you don't agree, you risk a meltdown of      the entire global financial system. Your own constituents'      savings could go down with it. An election is six weeks away.      Besides, in the last two days of trading, since rumors spread      that the Treasury and the Fed were planning something of this      sort, stock prices revived.       Now--quick--what do you do? You have no choice but to say      yes.       But you might also set some conditions on Wall Street.       The public doesn't like a blank check. They think this      whole bailout idea is nuts. They see fat cats on Wall Street      who have raked in zillions for years, now extorting in effect      $2,000 to $5,000 from every American family to make up for      their own nonfeasance, malfeasance, greed, and just plain      stupidity. Wall Street's request for a blank check comes at      the same time most of the public is worried about their jobs      and declining wages, and having enough money to pay for gas      and food and health insurance, meet their car payments and      mortgage payments, and save for their retirement and      childrens' college education. And so the public is asking:      Why should Wall Street get bailed out by me when I'm getting      screwed?       So if you are a member of Congress, you just might be in a      position to demand from Wall Street certain conditions in      return for the blank check.       My five nominees:       1. The government (i.e. taxpayers) gets an equity stake in      every Wall Street financial company proportional to the      amount of bad debt that company shoves onto the public. So      when and if Wall Street shares rise, taxpayers are rewarded      for accepting so much risk.       2. Wall Street executives and directors of Wall Street      firms relinquish their current stock options and this year's      other forms of compensation, and agree to future compensation      linked to a rolling five-year average of firm profitability.      Why should taxpayers feather their already amply-feathered      nests?       3. All Wall Street executives immediately cease making      campaign contributions to any candidate for public office in      this election cycle or next, all Wall Street PACs be closed,      and Wall Street lobbyists curtail their activities unless      specifically asked for information by policymakers. Why      should taxpayers finance Wall Street's outsized political      power--especially when that power is being exercised to get      favorable terms from taxpayers?       4. Wall Street firms agree to comply with new regulations      over disclosure, capital requirements, conflicts of interest,      and market manipulation. The regulations will emerge in      ninety days from a bi-partisan working group, to be convened      immediately. After all, inadequate regulation and lack of      oversight got us into this mess.       5. Wall Street agrees to give bankruptcy judges the      authority to modify the terms of primary mortgages, so      homeowners have a fighting chance to keep their homes. Why      should distressed homeowners lose their homes when Wall      Streeters receive taxpayer money that helps them keep their      fancy ones?       Wall Streeters may not like these conditions. Well, you      should tell them that the public doesn't like the idea of      bailing out Wall Street. So if Wall Street doesn't accept      these conditions, it doesn't get the blank check.                                  ____                  [From Bloomberg.com, Sept 19, 2008]      Sue Them, Jail Them, Make Them Pay for Meltdown: Ann Woolner                      (Commentary by Ann Woolner)       As it stands, the rest of us will be paying much money over      a long time for the greed and bad judgment of those who      melted down the economy.       Hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars are propping up      firms that a relative few money lenders and Wall Street      wizards ruined.       If that weren't enough, the crisis is shrinking the money      that Americans diligently socked away for retirement, down      payments on first homes, college for the kids or this      winter's heating bill. We might as well have opened our      windows and tossed out cash.       Beyond crimping living standards around the globe, the      crumbling of the U.S. financial system has prompted action      radical for a nation devoted to free enterprise. However      necessary, it's nothing short of astounding that the U.S.      government essentially nationalized the largest insurance      company in the country.       The real kick in the teeth is that the executives who      inflicted all this financial pain, who forced unprecedented      government takeovers, walk away with hundreds of millions of      dollars. It's up to us--innocent little us--to dig into our      pockets, into our futures and into our children's futures to      fix their spectacular errors.       Stanley O'Neal took a $161 million package last year when      he left Merrill Lynch & Co. (remember Merrill Lynch?), even      without a severance package in the mix. Angelo Mozilo,      founder and top executive at Countrywide Financial Corp.,      reaped almost $122 million during 2007 in stock options      alone.       For a mere three months at the helm of American      International Group Inc., Chief Executive Officer Robert      Willumstad gets a $7 million package.                         Selling Stock Options       And while the value of Richard Fuld's shares in Lehman      Brothers Holdings Inc. plunged roughly $1 billion, he still      pulled in almost $490 million by selling options and share      grants in the 14 years that the company's been public,      according to Fortune magazine.       We now know those shares were grossly overpriced, resting      as they did on subprime mortgages. Shouldn't he give back      most of it? All of it?       At least the government is blocking the $24 million given      to the fired top guns at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both      taken over earlier this month.       As a rule, it isn't easy to take back money or benefits      awarded as part of an employment contract, unless you can      figure out some way the executive violated the contract's      terms.       But it's worth a try. Consider these options.       Toss the rascals in jail. Criminal prosecution allows the      government to seize ill-gotten gains. Snip the straps off      those golden parachutes and grab them. Take over bank      accounts, investment accounts, mansions, private planes and      yachts.                              Bear Stearns       The feds did bring charges against a couple of Bear Stearns      Cos. hedge fund managers in June, and Federal Bureau of      Investigation Director Robert Mueller told Congress this week      his agency is pursuing possible suspects ``as far up the      corporate chain as necessary.''       The hitch is that proving executives lied in criminal ways      is easier said than done, Enron and WorldCom convictions      notwithstanding.       ``Criminal prosecutions need to be specific, detail-     oriented fact patterns where clear-cut criminality can be      established,'' says Robert Mintz, a white-collar criminal      defense lawyer and former prosecutor.       ``These are broad, sweeping market failures that have swept      up so many individuals and so many institutions that      prosecutors will have a hard time singling out any entity,      much less any institution, and hold them responsible,'' says      Mintz, a partner in McCarter and English in Newark, New      Jersey.       OK, so file civil suits.                           Sue the Directors       WorldCom shareholders sued and wrangled $18 million from      the pockets of directors, who agreed to pay more than 20      percent of their combined net worth. Another $36 million came      from the directors' insurance carriers.       These days, collecting from an insurer might not be the      best idea. If AIG is doing the insuring, it would be the      taxpayers paying out.       William McGuire, former CEO of UnitedHealth Group Inc.,      agreed this month to personally cough up $30 million to      resolve a lawsuit over stock-option backdating. That's on top      of the $600 million in benefits--mostly in stock options--he      said he will turn in to resolve another shareholder suit.       The problem is that it normally takes something akin to      criminal conduct, such as options backdating or accounting      fraud, for civil suits to take money out of the hands of     the accused. And, as previously noted, it isn't clear we will      have that here.                          Stricter Regulation       Well, what about government regulators? The U.S. Securities      and Exchange Commission didn't do anything to prevent this      meltdown. But at least, with New York Attorney General Andrew      Cuomo leading the charge, federal and state regulators have      forced investment banks to buy back billions of dollars worth      of auction-rate securities said to have been sold under      dubious claims of reliability.       The bankruptcy law may give Lehman Brothers creditors a      chance to grab some of the bonuses the firm paid out last      year.       If they can show bonuses were based on bogus claims of      solvency, they can go after them, according to compensation      expert Paul Hodgson of the Corporate Library, which analyzes      corporate governance issues.       Some plaintiffs' lawyers apply the same principle when      pushing for tougher corporate governance rules as part of      settling a case.       The idea is that CEOs and CFOs who drew bonuses based on      earnings that had to later be restated, for whatever reason,      must automatically return the excess amount, according to      Darren Robbins, a partner in Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman &      Robbins.       Frankly, it's only fair.                          ____________________
