President, I would again note that Senator Shelby and I have been working very hard on this appropriations bill, but so have a whole lot of other Senators, my colleague from Kansas being one of them.  Both Republicans and Democrats want to bring the Senate back to the way it should be, where we work things out between both parties. It means that everybody has to give something, and not everybody wins everything, but the country does very well. That is what we are trying to do on the appropriations bill. I think we can wrap these up, and I would hope that the other body, when they get back from their vacation, will be able to workwith us to get them finalized and to the President.  I must point out that it has taken the courage of a lot of Senators, both Republicans and Democrats, to work together to get this done. As the dean of the Senate--the longest serving one here--I applaud them very, very much.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
