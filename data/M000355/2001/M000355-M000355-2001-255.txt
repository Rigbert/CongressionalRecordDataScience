 FEINSTEIN. That is healthy. It is all hard dollars. It is regulated. It is all disclosed.  Mr. McCONNELL. Of course, as the Senator knows, all party soft money contributions are disclosed. That is how everyone knows what the parties are getting in soft dollars. There is no point in having that debate again. We had it yesterday. Soft dollars are gone. Now we are looking at a hard-dollar world.  I am trying to figure out how in the world the parties can compensate for the loss of those soft dollars under the proposal of the Senator from California. The annual aggregate under her proposal actually decreases the amount national parties can receive. Currently an individual can give $50,000 to national parties in a cycle; that is, over 2 years. But under the Feinstein proposal, I gather they can only receive $35,000 over a cycle; is that correct?
