 President, I will have more to say about the Senate business before the Senate later, but at this time I wish to express my sincere condolences to the entire Biden family in their moment of such deep and profound loss.  Beau Biden was known to many as a dedicated public servant, a loving father of two, and a devoted partner to the woman he loved, Hallie.  I have known the Vice President for many years, and it is hard to think of anything more important to him than his faith and his family. I hope he will find comfort in the former as he grieves such a terrible loss.  The Senate offers its Presiding Officer and every member of his family our prayers and our sympathy.                          ____________________
