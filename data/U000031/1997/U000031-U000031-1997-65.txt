Speaker, I recently had the honor of meeting personally with Mary Fisher, founder of the Family Aids Network, and of hearing her address a congressional briefing on the AIDS Drug Assistance Program [ADAP]. Her speech, ``If Not Now . . .'' is one of the most powerful and compelling statements I have heard on the need for a strong national commitment to assist persons with HIV and AIDS. Due to remarkable progress in the development of AIDS drug therapies, we now have combination drugs that can dramatically lower virus levels, that appear to be transforming AIDS from a fatal illness to a manageable chronic condition, and that may actually eliminate the virus entirely or almost entirely from the body.  But, Mary asks, do we have the national will to make these drugs available to all who need them? That is the question posed by the availability of these new therapies.  I am entering Mary's speech in today's Congressional Record because I believe it should be required reading for every Member of Congress--and every American.                          ``If Not Now . . .''                            (By Mary Fisher)       Thank you very much, Bill. I appreciate your kind words.       In order to be very brief today, I intend also to be very      direct. I do not mean to be brusque, but I do want to be      blunt. The good news is that I won't elongate your program      with a massive keynote address. The bad news is that I have      no time for good jokes.       Let me begin with a happy idea. We should be ashamed of      ourselves. Like evangelists caught in cheap motels with bad      magazines, we are where we ought not to be: Nearly two      decades into an epidemic that has killed hundreds of      thousands of Americans, we have gathered to discuss how many      more should die. I regret that we have come to this point      and, as an American, I am ashamed of it. And I want you to be      ashamed of it too. We should never have gotten ourselves to      the place we find ourselves. And we should get out of this as      soon as possible.       Pharmaceuticals represented here this noon have, by virtue      of hard work and well-principled research, produced drugs      that may prolong my life and the lives of others with AIDS.      They should take great pride in what they have achieved. I am      in their debt.       Members of Congress and their staff here this noon have,      through consensus-building and budget-brawling, protected      funds needed for AIDS research, AIDS-caregiving, and AIDS-     intervention. I am also in your debt.       And colleagues from the AIDS community are here who've      fought this epidemic with unimagined creativity and      unheralded courage, not out of a desire for national      recognition but out of a commitment to keep alive those who      are dying. I take enormous pride in being one of you, and in      the moral legacy written by pilgrims on the road to AIDS and      those who have cared for them.       In this afternoon's program, expert colleagues are going to      explain hard facts, large figures and complicated realities.      I am here not to give their speeches, but simply to set a      context. And the context I want to set is, in a word, shame.       For twenty years, this nation has treated persons with AIDS      as uniquely responsible for their own condition. Despite what      we know about smoking and cancer, we have not done to smokers      what we have done to persons with AIDS; despite what we know      about diet, we have not done to heart-attack sufferers what      we have done to persons with AIDS; despite what we know about      bucking horses and skydiving, we have not done to Christopher      Reeves what we have done to persons with AIDS. Senators      debating HIV-infected immigrants have used, as their point of      useful reference, ``infested fruits''--a double entendre' on      both ``infection'' and the word ``Fruit.''       And because we have labored against such stigma and      dsicrimination, such ignorance and evil, we have not reached      common agreement on the most basic of all understasndings:      That Americans with AIDS do not deserve their disease but do      deserve our assistance.       Failure to achieve consensus across moral and political      lines on that fundamental reality has done more to contribute      to the destruction of the AIDS community than the virus      itself. So deep has the stigma been, so controversial the      epidemic, that more than a hundred thousand Americans had      died of the disease before an American president dared say      the word ``AIDS'' in public. Tens of thousands of obituaries      have lied about the cause of death, out of families' fear of      shame. And those of us who are left are often mute. How do I      explain to my sons Max and Zachary their father's death and      my disease, on the one hand, and the nation's response on the      other, with anything less than shame?       Archbishop Desmond Tutu once said that the South African      Truth Commission was created to ``release our shame, to move      us from anger to healing, from futility to hope.'' It is      Tutu's sense of shame--an active shame, a useful shame; shame      that says ``for     crying outloud, it's enough already''--which should motivate      us to do what we've not done before.       The epidemic is nearly two decades long. Hundreds of      thousands of Americans have died. Hundreds of thousands more      are in danger of dying. What stands between these Americans      and death is drugs; what stands between these Americans and      drugs is money; and what stands between these Americans and      money is...us, the American people, the United States      government, and the AIDS Drug Assistance Program.       I've spoken in many settings, but I've never before stood      in public to argue for any single piece of legislation. I've      worked quietly, confidentially, off-the-record with countless      legislators and leaders, including some of you here today.      But the time has come for many of us to do what we've not      done before, including me. I need to say publicly that we, as      a nation, should be ashamed at how we have treated those with      AIDS. And I need to call all of us, you and me, to assure      that life-prolonging and death-deferring drugs are      available for every HIV-infected person in this nation,      not when we stand at death's door, but while we stand in      the public square. Politics and science make it possible,      economics and morality make it imperative. If we do not      embrace the opportunity now, we have consciously and      unconscionably prolonged the legacy of shame.       We have a new person filling the position popularly known      as ``AIDS czar.'' Sandy Thurman is a good and decent person,      committed and compassionate. She has no history in this      position and, therefore, no enemies' list. Democrats and      Republicans alike have every reason to work with Sandy. And      if she requires the assistance of people from both sides of      the aisle--whether we are homemakers or newsmakers--if we      understand the shame that our national response to date has      earned us, we will work with her.       The Vice President has argued, recently, for expanding      Medicaid coverage to provide interventions earlier in the      case of persons who are infected. This proposal makes      enormous sense scientifically, morally, and economically--it      will absolutely decrease, not increase, Medicaid spending. To      my knowledge, no Republicans have responded with assaults.      Therefore, the idea is still alive that common sense and      common decency would have a place in common policies.       We need not have another bureau or department to consume      funds, nor does ADAP propose one. We need not have another      study to justify funds, nor does ADAP require one. What we      need is consensus that those who are infected deserve an      opportunity to live. It is a proposition so simple, and so      morally compelling, that both AIDS Action and the Catholic      Archbishops can agree on it. It is, at its simplest root,      merely a pro-life argument.       Others here today will present the scientific data and the      economic numbers. I do not doubt how convincing the case will      be. What I wonder about, even worry about, is this: that      after two decades of death and dying, we will not yet have      the will to move toward hope, even when hope is staring us in      the face.       I spoke last week in Arthur Ashe's hometown. I admitted      that the AIDS community is no longer certain what to hope      for. My own care for my late husband Brian, in the days      before he died, is not uncommon--many of us with AIDS are      cared for by others with AIDS. But now we face an altogether      new situation, unimaginable the Sunday morning Brian died.       One of us will respond well to the new [drug] cocktail, and      one of us will not. How then will we live together as one      rises up from the grave and another sinks into it? Does      ``survivor guilt'' leave room for love?       ``One of us will be able to afford protease inhibitors,'' I      said in Richmond, ``and one of us will not. How, then, will      we live together in community? How will I love you, if I know      you are staying with your children while, for lack of money,      I am losing mine?'' The fragile bonds that hold together the      weakening, fragile AIDS commnity, cannot withstand such      division. Which is why I have come to argue for a legislative      action.       Make no mistake about it: the reason AIDS-related death      rates have gone down for American men and gone up for      American women \1\ is access to drugs--early access, complete      access, sustained access. In the AIDS community, the great      difference between men without children, and women with      children, is this: One group is living longer, and one is      not.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \1\The CDC recently released a morbidity report on American      AIDS-related deathrates, 1996, showing that such deathrates      had decreased 21% for Caucasians, decreased 10% for      Hispanics, and decreased 2% for African Americans; decreased      15% for males and increased 3% for heterosexual      transmissions.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       The power to change these deathrates is in this room. If      those of you who are Republican leaders will say to those who      are Democrats, ``We should be ashamed of these deaths,''      these statistics can be changed. We have no cure, but we have      within our power the ability to end the immoral discrepancy      between those who live and those who die for lack of access      to drugs.       If the AIDS organizations will work with the religious      community; if the pharmacies will work with the legislators;      if those on the Hill will work with those in the White House;      if staff members from both sides of the aisle will make      vulnerable lives more important than political ambitions--it      can be done. We can have the experience with AIDS that South      Africa has had with apartheid: we can put behind us the      darkest days.       When I imagine that goal being attainable, and I look at an      audience of such concentrated power, I cannot refrain from      asking, ``If not you, who? And if not now, my God, when?''       You must go explain your actions to your colleagues and      your constituents. I must go explain mine to two children      not-yet-ten years old. But both you and I must first explain      them to ourselves and to Our Maker. In that private chamber      of our own souls, surely we can agree that there's been dying      enough, and discrimination enough, and injustice enough.       What's offered us here, today, of science economics, of      policies and protocols, may not give us a cure. But it can      take us away from shame toward hope. If you would act on      that, then I and my fellow-pilgrims on the road to AIDS will      offer you more than our thanks, and more than our votes. We      will offer on your behalf this ancient prayer, ``Grace to      you, and peace.''                               ____________________
