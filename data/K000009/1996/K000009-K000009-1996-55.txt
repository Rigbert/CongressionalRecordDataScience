I want to compliment the First Lady, Hillary Clinton. I understand today she was in New York City somewhere sewing on a label, I hope it was a made in the USA label, to a garment in New York City. And we look forward to welcoming Secretary Reich to that very important hearing on sweatshops and what is happening to women workers in New York City who sew so many of the garments still made in this country that are worn by women across this country.  Thank you so very much for being a part of that and for the kind invitation.  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record the article to which I referred.                [From the New York Times, Feb. 21, 1996]                      Squeezing the Textile Worker                           (By John Holusha)       Pisgah, AL.--Martha Smith cried as she left the Dover Mills      plant of Andover Togs Inc. on a Wednesday afternoon late in      January. Along with approximately 100 other people, she had      lost her job sewing children's clothing.       Now she is enrolled in a state-sponsored program to learn      clerical skills. ``There's no more textile jobs around      here,'' she said. ``They are all going to Mexico and      overseas.''       Ms. Smith, who has lost three jobs due to plant closings,      seems to have the evidence on her side. Two other sewing      mills in this region of northern Alabama closed at about the      same time, sending 550 people, most of them women, into the      local labor market.       The layoffs are not just a regional phenomenon. After four      years of stability, employment in the apparel industry took a      sudden plunge last year, falling by more than 10 percent, to      846,000, from 945,000 at the end of 1994. An additional      42,000 jobs vanished in the fabrics industry, which produces      the raw material to make clothing, for a total shrinkage of      141,000 jobs--40 percent of all manufacturing jobs lost in      the United States last year.       Job losses like these provide grist to politicians with      protectionist messages, especially in an election year. So      while dismantling trade barriers benefits most consumers by      lowering prices, it also deepens blue-collar anxieties in      industries that are vulnerable to foreign competition.       The new wave of job losses in the apparel industry, coming      as they did soon after the passage of the North American Free      Trade Agreement and the latest global trade accord, benefits      candidates who say they want to save jobs and protect      workers. Four years ago it was Ross Perot railing against      free trade accords, and this year, the Republican populist,      Patrick J. Buchanan, has enjoyed a surge in the polls with      his attacks on free trade as a sellout of American labor.       And while textile-plant closings have been a fixture of the      economic scene in the small towns of the South and Northeast      for nearly a quarter-century, the recent hemorrhage of jobs,      though predicted by many economists, is devastating some      areas. It is driven by two forces--government policy, which      encourages free trade with low-cost apparel exporters like      Mexico and Malaysia, and high technology, which helps big,      profitable textile companies produce more cloth with fewer      workers.       ``We have lost on the order of 500,000 jobs in apparel in      the past 23 years and we will probably lose another 40,000 to      50,000 this year,'' said Carl Priestland, an economist with      the American Apparel Manufacturers Association.       Most of the pain will be felt in small towns like Pisgah,      named after the mountain that Moses climbed to get his first      glimpse of the Promised Land. Locals fear that Andover Togs,      Pisgah's biggest employer, will shut down its remaining      operations, including lithography and engineering, in      addition to the sewing plant it just closed. If that happens,      400 more jobs will disappear--and with them, the town's hopes      for an economic recovery.       ``I do a good business with people at the mill, so this is      going to slow down the economy big time,'' said R.D.      Mitchell, a former mayor who runs a Chevron service station      that is one of the town's unofficial gathering spots. ``There      are a lot of people being pushed out of jobs within a 20-mile      radius of here,'' he added. ``People can't spend money they      don't have.''       For all the financial turmoil in textile workers' lives      these days, the industry itself remains a huge and profitable      sector of the American economy. Output has grown steadily,      from $32.8 billion in 1974, to $56.3 billion in 1984 and to      $74.2 billion in 1994, the last year for which figures are      available. Even after adjusting for inflation, the increase      over the last two decades has been more than 33 percent.      Profits in 1994 totaled $1.74 billion, or 2.7 percent of      sales, half the 5.4 profit margin for all manufacturing.       Broadly speaking, the textile trade consists of three      sectors. Fiber manufacturers, the smallest of the three, spin      cotton and other raw materials into threads for the fabric      makers, which weave the threads into cloth for apparel      producers to make into clothing.       While it is profitable, the continued prosperity of the      industry hinges in large part on its ability to squeeze out      as many American jobs as possible from the production      process. The two main sectors--raw fabrics and finished      clothing--achieve that goal in two very different ways,      cutting labor costs and automation. And industry experts say      that outside attempts to stanch the bleeding may do more harm      than good.       Clothing manufacturers, swamped by a flood of cheap imports      from Asia and elsewhere that have grabbed 50 percent of the      American market, up from 20 percent two decades ago, stay      profitable by exporting jobs to low-wage Latin American      countries like Mexico and the Dominican Republic.       These companies have been unable to exploit America's      vaunted technological superiority to offset their foreign      rivals' wage advantage because no one has been able to      develop an economical alternative to the old-fashioned sewing      machine. Automated machines have a hard time handling soft,      floppy cloth, and the vision-recognition systems needed to      match patterns at seams, collars and cuffs are far too      expensive for the low-margin apparel business.       In an integrated apparel factory, one that converts raw      fabric to finished clothes, 50 percent of the jobs are sewing      machine operators, 86 percent of whom are women. ``You can      automate design, you can automate pattern setting and      cutting, but sooner or later you have to push fabric through      a sewing machine,'' Mr. Priestland said. ``That's still the      bottleneck.''       And that is where governmental policy comes in.      Congressional approval of the North American and world trade      accords in 1994 and 1995 made it much easier for American      corporations to bring in goods from factories in third world      countries, notably Mexico, by moving to eliminate quotas on      imported apparel.       The search for cheap labor is nothing new. Many of the      mills that are closing now migrated to impoverished regions      of the rural South decades ago from the relatively prosperous      Northeast. Even today, says David Thornell, director of the      economic development authority of Jackson County, an      economically depressed region that includes Pisgah, many of      the factory workers here till the fields part time to make      ends meet.       But with the factory idle, farming alone will not pay all      the bills, and residents are bitter. ``They pay those people      down there a dollar and a nickel an hour,'' said Jim      Mabry, another Pisgah resident. ``Then they ship the      clothes back here for finishing so they can call them      American-made.       Andover Togs, which is based in New York, says it had      little choice but to open its factory in the Dominican      Republic. ``I don't think we have ever seen a retail      environment this sour,'' said Alan Kanis, the company's chief      financial officer. He added that the company's major      customers, discount chains like Wal-Mart and Kmart, were      major importers, forcing the company to keep a tight rein on      its costs.       David Buchanan, associate dean of the college of textiles      at North Carolina State University, predicted more mills      would shut down. The trend could turn out-of-the-way places      like Pisgah into ghost towns, just as many farms villages in      the upper Midwest faded into history when farming became      mechanized.       ``Historically, the role of the textile and apparel      industry has been to provide employment for the otherwise      unemployable,'' Mr. Buchanan said. ``But that has been      changing. If there is no work, the sons and daughters will      move away, the way they did in farming. If there is no reason      for a town to exist, it will go away.''       If American apparel makers are surviving by hiring cheap      labor overseas, the other big component of the textile      industry, the companies that weave the cloth and fabric, is      thriving by applying the latest technology at home.       A visit to the Cone Mills Corporation plant in Greensboro,      N.C., shows the strides in productivity that American fabric      makers have made in recent years. In the weaving room, a      total of 416 looms pump out 12,000 square yards of denim      every hour, nearly 50 percent more than the 1,000 older      machines that they replaced. Yet they are so much easier to      operate that only about 20 workers are needed to tend them,      about one for every 21 looms and a tiny fraction of the      400 or so workers that handled the previous generation.       Not only that, but weaving technology is about to take a      major step forward. The projectile looms in use now can      insert 258 threads a minute; new air-jet machines just now      coming onto factory floors can process 745 a minute, nearly      three times as many.       Cone plans to replace its older machines with the more      advanced models but will not increase its production      capacity, since little growth is seen in the American market.      ``We'll just have fewer looms and fewer people,'' said      Patrick Danahy, Cone's president.       The combination of faster machines and fewer people      explains the decline in employment in the fabric industry      from more than 700,000 in the late 1980's to 625,700 in      January, even as fabric output increased.       Although the people in Pisgah are unhappy when their jobs      depart for Caribbean nations like the Dominican Republic, the      location is good news for the American fabric industry      because the new factories there are more likely to buy cloth      from them rather than their Asian competitors.       ``Eighty percent of clothing imports from Mexico and the      Caribbean are made of American fabric,'' Carlos Moore,      executive vice president of the American Textile      Manufacturers institute, said. ``That explains why we have      been able to supply a lot of fabric in the face of slow      growth and imports.''       And though the recent liberalization of world trade seems      to be accelerating the exodus of apparel jobs from the United      States, Mr. Moore said it might also provide an opportunity      to increase American raw-textile exports. ``Most countries      have traditionally protected their textile industries, but      now they may be forced to open up,'' he said.       Moreover, some people question whether the North American      Free Trade Agreement and other trade pacts should be blamed      for the flight of jobs abroad. Without the trade agreement,      Mr. Danahy of Cone Mills said, ``Both the apparel and textile      jobs would have gone to Bangladesh and elsewhere in the Far      East.       ``With Nafta in place,'' he added, ``the textile complex on      this continent is more competitive.''
