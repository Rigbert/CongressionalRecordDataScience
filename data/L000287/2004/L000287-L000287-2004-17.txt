Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity yesterday to visit the State of Mississippi and to visit the city of Philadelphia in Neshoba County.                              {time}  1500   Hundreds of black and white citizens gathered in Neshoba County in the city of Philadelphia. The mayor of the city of Philadelphia, the Governor, former Governor Winters, the former Secretary of State, Dick Molpus, and hundreds and hundreds of other citizens gathered to pay tribute to these three young men.  Forty years ago today, three courageous young Americans, Andy Goodman, James Chaney and Mickey Schwerner, paid the ultimate price for trying to secure voting rights for all of our citizens. These three young men, simply because they were black and white working together to expand democracy, were arrested by the sheriff and his deputy. Later that same evening, they were taken to jail and turned over to the Klan where they were beaten, shot, and killed.  As I said yesterday, and I will say it again today, it is unbelievable, it is unreal, but it did happen. These three young people did not die in Europe, they did not die in Africa, in Vietnam or the Middle East, but right here in our own country, in the heart of the South, in the State of Mississippi. As a Nation and as a people we must never, ever forget the sacrifice they made. Their blood helped to cultivate and grow the seeds of our democracy.  Forty years ago in the State of Mississippi, that State had a black voting age population of more than 450,000, but only about 16,000 blacks were registered to vote. People had to pass a so-called literacy test and interpret some section of the constitution of the State of Mississippi. On one occasion there was a man who had a graduate degree, a Ph.D. degree, and he flunked the so-called literacy test. On another occasion in an adjoining State, the State of Alabama, a man was asked to give the number of bubbles in a bar of soap.  These three brave and courageous citizens, young citizens of America, must be looked upon as the founding fathers of the new America. James Chaney, Mickey Schwerner, and Andy Goodman helped beat down one of the mightiest walls of resistance to equal justice in America. We must never, ever forget their sacrifice for the freedom of us all. They made it possible for many of us to stand here today in this Congress.  Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure and my delight to yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton), who came to Mississippi as a young lawyer, brave, courageous, to work during the summer of 1964 with those of us in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.
