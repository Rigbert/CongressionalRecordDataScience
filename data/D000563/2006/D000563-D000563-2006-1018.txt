I think we have had a very valuable dialogue, and the Senator from Oklahoma has made some important concessions. But I would like to make sure that, for the Record, I understand the intent and language of the amendment which he currently offers.  Has the Senator changed the version which referenced section 161: ``Declaration of official language,'' which shows on page 2 of the amendment?
