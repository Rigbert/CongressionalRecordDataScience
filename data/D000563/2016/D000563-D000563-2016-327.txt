President, if we ask most Americans: What is the difference between a for-profit college and university and a not-for-profit college and university, a private university, most of them would say: I am not sure I can tell you.  Well, certainly for-profit, by definition, is a business. It is primarily a business that generates a profit for the company if it is successful. It pays for the salaries and compensation of those who work for the company, and if there are shareholders, it tries to increase the value of shares and maybe even pay a dividend.  The others--the not-for-profits--by definition don't do that, and most private universities are not for profit. Examples: University of Illinois, a public university, the University of Maryland. Private universities: Georgetown University, George Washington University. For-profit universities: The University of Phoenix--people have probably heard of it--DeVry University out of Chicago, IL; ITT Tech; Kaplan, these are for-profit colleges and universities. Are they different? They are dramatically different.  Let me give my colleagues three numbers that define the difference between for-profit colleges and universities and all the others. Here are the numbers: Ten percent of all of college students in America go to for-profit colleges and universities, like the University of Phoenix. These, many times online, universities including Kaplan and DeVry, 10 percent of the students go to them.  Twenty percent of all of the Federal aid to education goes to for-profit colleges and universities. Why is it twice as much as the percentage of students? They are darned expensive. They have tuition that is usually much more costly than other colleges and universities.  So that is 10 percent of the students, 20 percent of the Federal aid to education, and the next number is 40. Forty percent of all the student loan defaults in the United States of America are students attending for-profit colleges and universities--10 percent of the students, 40 percent of the student loan defaults. Why? The answer is obvious. They are very expensive and the education they provide often isn't worth much.  Students who enroll and start courses at for-profit colleges and universities get in over their heads and drop out--the worst possible outcome. Now they are deep in debt with no degree, and they default on their loan. Some finish, and for many of them, it is even worse. After they have stacked up all of this debt, they graduate from a for-profit college and university and find out the diploma is worthless. That is the reality of higher education in America today.  For quite a long time I have come to the Senate floor and talked about these for-profit colleges and universities. I got into this by meeting a young woman from a southern suburb of Cook County. She went to a place called Westwood College, a for-profit college and university based out of Colorado. She had been watching all of these CSI shows and the rest of them. She was just caught up in law enforcement. She wanted to get into law enforcement. So she enrolled at this for-profit college--Westwood--and started attending classes. Well, it turned out to be expensive, and then it turned out to be a disaster.  Five years later, she graduated and received her diploma from Westwood. She took the diploma to police departments and sheriffs' offices all around the region and they looked at her and said: Sorry, but that is not a real university. You have gone to school there for 5 years, and I know you have the diploma, but we don't recognize Westwood. Westwood College is not a real university.  So she found out her diploma was worthless, she couldn't get a job, but here is the worst part: At that point, she had $95,000 in student debt--$95,000 in debt--and a worthless diploma. Where do you turn?  Well, let me tell you what happened to her. She moved back in with her parents, living in the basement. Her dad came out of retirement, took a job to try to help her pay off her student loans at Westwood, and she started to think about: How do I go to a real school now--a community college or something--so I can get an education. She wasted 5 years of her life, and her decisions from that point forward will reflect the fact that she had this terrible experience.  There are things which these for-profit colleges and universities do which other universities wouldn't do. I want to talk about one of them today. The abuses of this industry are clear. Hundreds of thousands of students have been deceived, misled, and harassed into enrolling in these schools where they end up with a mountain of debt and a worthless diploma. Every day seems to bring news about another for-profit college scam, and I have been giving these speeches for a while, and it keeps unfolding day after day. Here is the latest: the complaint the attorney general of Massachusetts filed recently against ITT Tech for abusive recruitment tactics. I know this ITT Tech because in my hometown of Springfield, IL, at White Oaks Mall, they have a big sign. They look like the real thing, but when Massachusetts took a look at their recruiting tactics, it turned out they were lying to the students. You see, they need to lure in students to sign up at ITT Tech, they make promises they can't keep, and many times they lure in students who are not ready for college. Why do they do that? Because the minute a low-income student signs up at ITT Tech, the Pell grant, which goes to low-income college students, flows through the student to ITT Tech. There is $5,800 just for being low income and signing up, not to mention what follows--the college student loans.  If a student is lucky--if they are lucky--the for-profit college will lead them to the college loans originated by the government. Those are more reasonable. If they are unlucky, they get steered by these for-profit colleges to private loans with dramatically higher interest rates and terms which are not the least bit forgiving.  We say to ourselves: These students ought to know better. Well, how smart were you when it came to the ways of the world when you were 19 years old?How much did you know about borrowing $10,000 when you were 19 or 20 years old, when they shoved across the desk a stack of papers and said: If you will sign these for your loan, you will be able to start classes Monday. You know what happens. The students sign up. They have been told their whole lives: This is what you need to do. When you finish high school, you go to college.  Here is another part of it that is very important. Right now, the Department of Education is working on new Federal regulations so that when the students go to these for-profit schools--or any school for that matter--and the school engages in unfair, deceptive, or abusive conduct, there is some protection. The Department has set up a rulemaking, but because the negotiations with outside stakeholders haven't reached a consensus, they are still working on the rule.  Let me talk about one issue that I think is critical that is under consideration by the Department of Education when it comes to these for-profit colleges: mandatory arbitration clauses. You are going to find at for-profit colleges--and at virtually no other college--a little paragraph stuck in that enrollment agreement, stuck in your enrollment contract, which says that if you have any grievance with that for-profit school, if you think they deceived you, defrauded you, lied to you, if you think that you got in debt for a promised degree that was going to lead to a job, you can't plead your case in court after you sign this agreement.  You have to go to mandatory arbitration. Mandatory arbitration, for those not familiar with it, is a closed-door process. The company or school, in this case, sets standards about who will decide your fate and about what of anything that happened to you ever becomes public. Why do the for-profit schools do this? They don't want to be taken to court--no company does. They certainly don't want to face a class action lawsuit by students who have been defrauded by these for-profit schools, and they certainly don't want the Department of Education to know that a certain number of students of for-profit schools have a grievance about the way they were treated. So they have come up with a mandatory arbitration clause in documents a student has to sign to go to class. Students by and large don't even see them. They are buried in the document. If they did see them, they would find it hard to even explain. These clauses require students to give up their right to a day in court. It means, for example, that if a student is misled or deceived by the school's advertising or Web site and the student goes into debt and then can't find a job or can't qualify for a job that they promised you could, the student doesn't get a day in court. Instead, the student is forced into the secret arbitration proceeding where the deck is stacked against them. It allows schools to avoid accountability for misconduct. It prevents prospective students from knowing that there were an awful lot of other students at the same school that had the same bad experience.  It is fine for schools to give students the choice of arbitration, but to say it is mandatory and that you have no other choice is wrong. Mandatory arbitration clauses are not used by legitimate not-for-profit colleges and universities. Not-for-profit colleges, public and private, are comfortable with being held accountable to the students. They don't require mandatory arbitration in order for the students to sign up for classes. The Association of Public Land Grant Universities, the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, the Association of Community College Trustees, and the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers all confirmed what I just said. Unfortunately, mandatory arbitration clauses are a hallmark of the for-profit industry, used by nearly all major companies--DeVry, the University of Phoenix, and ITT Tech, just to name a few.  These same clauses were used by a for-profit school called Corinthian, which went bankrupt. What happens when a for-profit college goes bankrupt? They have received the money through the student from the Federal Government. They have received all those Pell grants. They have received the money for government loans, and now they are officially out of business.  Where does that leave the student if the school closes? Well, we give them a pretty tough choice. The first choice is to keep the credit hours they earned at the for-profit school and transfer to another school--too often another for-profit. Is that worth the effort? Well, the student has to decide or drop those credit hours of the for-profit school and get what is called a closed school discharge. You don't have to pay it back. Who loses in that deal? The taxpayers. The taxpayers who have sent thousands of dollars to these worthless for-profit schools.  I am hoping the Department of Education will promulgate a rule that protects students and their families when it comes to these for-profit schools. There is one last thing I want to say about college loans, and it probably is the most important. If someone borrows money for a car or a home or a piece of property somewhere or to buy some goods and then they fall on hard times--somebody in the family gets sick, there are big medical bills, someone loses a job, or there is a divorce--and they are forced into bankruptcy court to clear their debts, they are going to find out if they have a student loan, they can't discharge a student loan in bankruptcy. It means, frankly, that it is with them for a lifetime. When grandma decides to cosign her granddaughter's college loan and her granddaughter defaults on the loan, the collection agency calls her grandmother. We have cases that have been reported where grandmothers have their Social Security checks basically garnished to pay off the granddaughter's student loan. It is a debt, frankly, that will be with them for a lifetime. That is why this conversation is so important.  A few years ago, the for-profit colleges and universities ended up with the same treatment as every other college and university, and they, too, when it comes to student debt, have their investment protected because the student cannot discharge it in bankruptcy.  This Senator thinks the Department of Education has the authority to clean this up.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a legal analysis put together by Public Citizen outlining the authority the Department of Education has to ban mandatory arbitration.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                               Public Citizen,                                Washington, DC, February 24, 2016.     Dr. John B. King, Jr.,     Acting Secretary of Education,     Washington, DC.                            CITIZEN PETITION       The federal government spends more than $128 billion      annually on student aid distributed under Title IV of the      Higher Education Act (HEA), 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1070 et seq. This      aid, which includes Stafford, PLUS, and Perkins loans, as      well as Pell grants, is the largest stream of federal      postsecondary education funding.       While profiting from U.S. taxpayers, some predatory      schools--particularly in the for-profit education sector--     target underserved populations of students, including people      of color, low-income individuals, and veterans, with      fraudulent recruitment practices. These schools provide      students with an education far inferior to what has been      promised. They offer low quality programs and faculty,      provide few if any student-support services, and have abysmal      graduation and job-placement rates. Many students drop out      once they realize the extent of a school's      misrepresentations. Those who do not may find themselves with      a worthless degree. In either case, the school's wrongdoing      leaves many students with a debt to the federal government      that they cannot repay.       Unfortunately, the courthouse doors are closed to many of      these students because they signed mandatory, pre-dispute      arbitration agreements at the time of their enrollment. Under      these agreements, students are required to use binding      arbitration to resolve any dispute they may later have with      the school; they are barred from the courts. As demonstrated      in this petition, these arbitration clauses are detrimental      to students, hamper efforts to uncover wrongdoing by      institutions receiving Title IV assistance, and place the      federal investment in Title IV programs at risk.       Public Citizen, Inc., a consumer organization with members      and supporters nationwide, submits this citizen petition      under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 553(e) to request that the Department of      Education issue a rule requiring institutions to agree, as a      condition on receipt of Title IV assistance under the HEA,      not to include pre-dispute arbitration clauses in enrollment      or other agreements with students. This rule would be      consistent with the Department's legal authority under the      HEA     and with the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. Sec. 1      et seq. It would also be in line with a call by members of      Congress for the Department to condition Title IV funding on      a school's commitment not to use forced arbitration clauses      or other contractual barriers to court access in student      enrollment agreements.                        I. STATEment OF INTEREST       Since its founding in 1973, Public Citizen has advocated on      behalf of its members and supporters for public access to the      civil justice system. As part of that work, it seeks to end      the use of forced arbitration clauses in consumer contracts      because these clauses are fundamentally unfair to consumers,      encourage unlawful corporate behavior, and weaken the utility      of enforcement efforts to protect the public. Public Citizen      is engaged in efforts to encourage the Consumer Financial      Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Securities and Exchange      Commission (SEC) to ban pre-dispute arbitration agreements in      consumer and investor agreements. Public Citizen's counsel      have represented parties in several major cases involving the      scope of the FAA and the enforceability of pre-dispute      arbitration agreements. Public Citizen also frequently      appears as amicus in cases involving these issues.       In addition to its arbitration work, Public Citizen      supports robust regulation of predatory educational      institutions and student lending practices that leave      students saddled with debt for overpriced educations. It      participated in the Department's Gainful Employment      rulemaking, and its attorneys represent twenty-eight      organizations as amici in support of that rule in Association      of Private Sector Colleges and Universities v. King, No. 15-     5190 (D.C. Cir.). Counsel for Public Citizen have also      represented parties and amici in numerous cases involving      misconduct by for-profit educational institutions.
