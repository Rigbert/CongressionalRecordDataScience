Chairman, I was to offer an amendment tonight that would require disclosure of paid lobbyists' contacts with Members. I thought it would be extraordinarily valuable to the public and the lobbyist community. But in the interests of getting this bill passed and getting some improvement in this situation here in Washington, I will withhold that amendment tonight and would urge everybody to oppose all amendments because it is a ruse to kill the bill.  We have got to get this bill, begin reform, and then we can come back with more significant reforms later in a second piece of legislation that we will bring up after the first of the year.
