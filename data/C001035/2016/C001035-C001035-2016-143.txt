President, we are working very hard on both sides of the aisle. Senator Reed and I have been discussing a package of amendments which we ultimately hope to approve by unanimous consent. We are making sure that it is a balanced package, reflecting both Republican and Democratic initiatives. These are amendments that are acceptable to both of us as managers of the bill, but we are waiting for the process to work its way through. My hope is that we might be able to do it this evening, but if not this evening, then perhaps we will be able to turn to it first thing in the morning.  I thank the Presiding Officer and suggest the absence of a quorum.
