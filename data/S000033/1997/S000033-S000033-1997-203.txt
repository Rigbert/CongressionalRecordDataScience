 Speaker, I rise today in support of a bill which I introduced today, with Mr. Lipinski of Illinois and Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts as original cosponsors. This bill would require the Export-Import Bank of the United States, when selecting among firms to provide financial assistance, to give preference to any firm which has shown a commitment to reinvestment and job creation in the United States.  Mr. Speaker, this bill gets at, I believe the heart of the issue of the relationship between the U.S. Government, the taxpayers of this country and corporate America.  Mr. Speaker, let me tell you a little bit about some of the companies which have received financial assistance from the Export-Import Bank in recent years--and you tell me whether these are really the best companies that the middle income people of this country should be subsidizing. According to information from Ex-IM, among the top 25 companies which receive assistance from Ex-Im are Boeing, General Electric, and AT Let's take a brief look at these companies and see whether these really are the types of companies that the American taxpayers should be rewarding.  In terms of employment, in 1990 Boeing had 155,900 employees. In 1996, it had 103,600 employees--a decline of 52,300 jobs during that period. In other words, it laid off \1/3\ of its workforce, despite being the top recipient of Ex-Im aid.  Mr. Speaker, General Electric is the number two recipient of Ex-Im aid. In 1975 GE had 667,000 American workers. Twenty years later, it had 398,000, a decline of 269,000 jobs. General Electric CEO Jack Welch, is well known for his ruthlessness in moving GE jobs to anyplace in the world where he can get cheap labor--Mexico, China, and other poor Third World countries. Is this really the type of company we want to be rewarding with taxpayer subsidies? Downsizing American workers has been at the core of the Jack Welch philosophy at GE, and Ex-Im is actually providing millions of dollars in support of this company.  As for AT, in 1995 AT laid off 40,000 workers. Interestingly enough, reports show that in that same year, AT provided its CEO, Robert Allen, with $15 million in options plus a $11 million grant.  My point, Mr. Speaker, is that the entire approach of Ex-Im in terms of job creation is too narrow. They approach the idea of ``jobs through exports'' on a project-by-project basis, and ignore the totality of what the company is doing.  My bill is quite simple. This bill would simply require the Export-Import Bank to look at the totality of the situation. And if there is a company that is showing a commitment to job creation and reinvestment in the United States, then that company should receive preference for assistance.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                          ____________________
