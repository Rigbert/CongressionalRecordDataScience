President, addressing the majority leader through the Chair, I would note that even Grover Norquist, who is sort of the guru of many of the Republicans, testified before the Judiciary Committee that passing this bill and putting it into law would add nearly $1 trillion or more to the economy. All sorts of business leaders came in and said this would add to our economy. It is one of those rare cases where the AFL-CIO and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce came together because it would dramatically improve the economy, dramatically improve the wages of people, and it would lower the deficit. It is a no-brainer. That is why we came together in the Senate. With the leadership of the distinguished Senator from Nevada and others, Republicans and Democrats, we came together and we passed it.  They should take it up. If they want to make some changes, do so. I am ready to go to conference on it at a moment's notice so we can get this bill passed and on the President's desk.  We have shown we could do it before. We did it with the Violence Against Women Act, which they at first refused to take up in the House. Even the White House was backing off some of the parts we added to it here because they were afraid it might not go through. But Senator Crapo and I stuck together. A bipartisan group in the House stuck together, and they passed it in the House. We passed it, and it went into law. We added sexual trafficking. It is a good bill.  We can do it, if people want to. But if we take the position that we cannot do anything, that we just want to be naysayers and nihilistic about government, then, of course, we don't do anything. But here is a way to get the economy going. Here is a way to improve our Nation.  Frankly, I just wanted to stand and compliment the distinguished majority leader for speaking of what we can do, and I hope we do.                          ____________________
