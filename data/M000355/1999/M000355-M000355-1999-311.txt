 President, I rise today to address the issue of Chemical Weapons Demilitarization. I do so in order to point out that the Department of Defense has consistently ignored Congressional directive and intent.  In 1996, I offered and the Senate accepted an amendment which directed the Army to identify and demonstrate technologies other than baseline incineration which could be utilized in the destruction of America's chemical weapons stockpile. This program, which came to be known as the Assembled Chemical Weapons Assessment, or ACWA, enjoyed tremendous inititial success. Through the involvement of the DoD, the Army, technology providers and citizens advocacy groups--disparate interests, indeed--agreement was reached on how the process should proceed as well as the criteria for success. It is also critical to point out that one area of consensus was that the timely destruction of the stockpiles remained a top priority. Nobody involved in this process advocates unnecessary delay in efforts to comply with the Chemical Weapons Convention 2007 deadline. Certainly, I never viewed my efforts as anything other than a safeguard to ensure that once the destruction of the stockpile located in Kentucky began, only the safest method available was utilized.  Unfortunately, this is where the good news ends.  After rigorous evaluation and discussions, the decision was announced that six separate methods met the technological criteria necessary in order to be tested as alternatives to baseline incineration. These six were the only proposals of the almost 20 originally submitted for consideration which were deemed capable of producing safer methods. Unfortunately the Army and the Department of Defense made the decision to move forward and evaluate only three of the qualified technologies, leaving three untested. Further, this decision was made not on the basis of what was technologically feasible, but solely on the basis on what was cost-efficient. Not in the interests of finding the safest manner available to destroy the weapons, but on satisfying the minimum requirements so that the incineration could continue regardless of the results of the testing.  To help ease this budget difficulty, I offered and the Senate accepted, an amendment to the FY99 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill which gave the Secretary of Defense the Authority to reprogram up to $25 million in order to fully test each of the technologies which met the criteria for selection as potential alternatives to incineration. This provision was included in the final version of the Defense bill, and was eventually signed into law.  Mr. President, despite this clear expression of Congressional intent, the Army, the Department and the Administration have consistently refused to allocate sufficient funds to complete the testing. As a result, the ACWA program is in danger of losing its credibility--the very quality that led to its initial successes. If the testing of the three technologies does not produce a viable alternative to incineration, then the legitimate question will be posed, ``What about the additional proposals which were viewed to have merit as alternatives to incineration?''  Not wishing to answer that question, I worked to encourage the administration to agree that further testing was cost effective and in the best interests of the country. Their responses, which I will submit for the Record, professed their strong support for the goals of the ACWA program, but claimed that the budget was simply too tight for the Department to reprogram funds for additional testing.  With all due respect, that contention is simply false. The truth is that the Department of Defense and the Army made a decision years ago that they would eliminate chemical weapons using incineration and have resisted considering other options since that time.  This year's report, Senate Report 105-53, states that ``the Committee is concerned with the lack of oversight afforded the Chemical Demilitarization Program within the executive branch.''  Further the Report states:       In a review of the program's funding, the Committee      discovered that funds had systematically been obligated      without being expended and in some instances funds were      unobligated. Rather than facing a shortfall in funding, the      program had over $200,000,000 of Operation and Maintenance      funds unexpended at the end of fiscal year 1998. In light of      the unobligated and unexpended balances available to the      Department, the program growth in the budget request is not      justified.  Mr. President, this language is a stinging indictment of the Department's mismanagement of the Chemical Demilitarization program. Further it demonstrates clearly that there is no truth to the assertion that there were not sufficient funds available to allow for the demonstration of all viable alternatives to baseline incineration.  I intend to continue to press the Army to test all six technologies so that the citizens who live near our stockpiles may be assured that only the safest methods available are employed to destroy chemical weapons.  I ask unanimous consent that the letters to which I referred be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                  Deputy Secretary of Defense,                                Washington, DC, December 22, 1998.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: This responds to your interest in      the Assembled Chemical Weapons Assessment (ACWA) Program. I      regret any misunderstanding we may have had about responding      to your concerns on this matter.       As you know, Congress has directed the Department to      demonstrate and evaluate at least two alternatives to      baseline incineration for the disposal of assembled chemical      munitions. The ACWA Program actually identified six      technologies, exceeding the original requirement, but was      able to fund only three--the three that were ranked as the      best value to the U.S. Government. We would like to go      further, but the entire amount appropriated for support of      ACWA in the Fiscal year 1999 Defense Appropriations Act will      be required to complete demonstration testing and conduct a      non-government independent evaluation of cost and schedule      with regard to implementing an alternative technology.       The Act also provided authority to use up to an additional      $25 million of the funds appropriated for the Chemical      Demilitarization program in order to complete ACWA      demonstrations. This language, however, addressed authority      only; no additional funds were appropriated. While we will      vigorously press for savings in the Chemical Demilitarization      program, at this point, we are unable to exercise      reprogramming authority without jeopardizing our ability to      meet the Chemical Weapons Convention mandate of April 2007      for destruction of our chemical weapons stockpile. If,      however, additional funding becomes available in the coming      fiscal year to support the ACWA Program, we plan to expand      the scope of demonstration testing beyond the three      technologies already programmed.       Successful disposal of the chemical munitions stockpile and      compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention are among our      highest national security priorities. The ACWA Program is a      critical component of this effort. I want to thank you for      your support of this important program. Again, I regret any      misunderstanding concerning my response to your interest in      this matter.           Sincerely,     John Hamre.                                  ____                                   Under Secretary of Defense,                               Washington, DC, September 18, 1998.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: This is in reply to your letter to      Secretary Cohen regarding the Assembled Chemical Weapons      Assessment (ACWA) program. In that letter you asked about the      Department's plans for testing of alternative technologies.       As you may be aware, the Department of Defense      Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1997 mandated that we      identify and demonstrate not less than two alternatives to      the baseline incineration process for the demilitarization of      assembled chemical munitions. In selecting three technologies      to proceed to final demonstration testing we have exceeded      that requirement. We recognize the intent of the Senate as      evidenced in Sec. 8143 of the Senate passed FY 1999 DoD      Appropriation Bill. If additional funding becomes available      in the coming fiscal year to support the ACWA program, we      plan to reexamine the scope of demonstration testing.       A similar letter has been sent to your colleagues who      joined you in writing to Secretary Cohen regarding this      issue.           Sincerely,     William J. Lynn.                                  ____                             Executive Office of the President                                    Washington DC, March 22, 1999.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: Thank you for your letter about the      Assembled Chemical Weapons Assessment (ACWA) program. The      President requested that I respond directly to your letter.      The Administration shares your goals of safely disposing of      our chemical weapons stockpile and has been supportive of      your efforts to find environmentally sound alternatives to      the baseline incineration system for destroying these      chemical weapons.       As you know, the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 1997 created      the ACWA program and provided $40 million ``to identify and      demonstrate not less than two alternatives to the baseline      incineration process for the demilitarization of assembled      chemical munitions.'' In time, the ACWA program identified      six alternatives. Due to limitations of funds, only three      alternative technologies were selected for further      development and testing, one more than required by the 1977      Act. To fund the third alternative, funds had to be      reprogrammed from the baseline Chemical Demilitarization      program, which supports a safe and effective disposal process      in order to fund research into an additional system that may      or may not be selected at a future date for implementation.       As you pointed out in your letter, the FY 1999 Defense      Appropriations Act provides authority to reprogram up to $25      million from the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction,      Defense account to fund the demonstration of alternatives to      baseline incineration. Unfortunately, the Act also reduced      the President's request for the account by $78 million. This      reduction will severely challenge the Army's ability to      successfully destroy this Nation's chemical stockpile by      April 29, 2007, as required by the Chemical Weapons      Convention. As a result of the $78 million reduction, to date      we have been unable to identify available funds in the      Chemical Demilitarization program to reprogram to ACWA for      additional demonstration projects.       The Administration's policy is to proceed as quickly as      possible with the safe destruction of the Nation's chemical      stockpile, while at the same time seeking even safer and more      effective methods. The National Academy of Sciences concluded      in its 1994 study that the baseline incineration system is a      safe and effective disposal process for the stockpile. The      Administration will continue to seek even safer methods. We      look forward to working with you to that end.           Sincerely,                                                     Jacob J. Lew,                                                         Director.
