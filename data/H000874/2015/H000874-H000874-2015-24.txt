 Can I ask the gentleman again in terms of the timing of the omnibus. The existing CR, which is funding the government at the present time, expires as of midnight on the 11th. Does the gentleman have any insight as to the scheduling of the omnibus?  Presumably, we will have to pass it and give enough time for the Senate to consider it and then for the President to sign it.  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  As the gentleman knows, wrapping up legislative business in December is always unpredictable. In knowing that the omni is a larger bill, we want to allow plenty of time for Members to be able to see it and read it, but it is our intention to get it done by the deadline.  If we have to move it a few days later, we shall. We are scheduled to be here until the 18th, but we will get our business done.
