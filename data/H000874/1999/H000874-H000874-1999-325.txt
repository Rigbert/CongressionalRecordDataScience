Speaker, on Thursday, November 11, 1999, as the work of this House paused while Americans honored our veterans, we in the congressional community lost a veteran of our own. Timothy Leo Donohoe, a former House doorman and virtual fixture for many years at the Speaker's Lobby East door before his retirement in 1997, died suddenly on Veteran's Day at his home on Capitol Hill. Tim was only 54 years old, and he is greatly missed by the friends he leaves behind.  And, Mr. Speaker, Tim Donohoe leaves many friends. Tim served the Congress for 25 years, most of them for the Doorkeeper and Sergeant-at-Arms, so he knew most everyone who worked on and around the House floor. It was Tim's job as a doorman to know every Member of Congress, including the Senators who often appeared at his door, and he did, whether a Member had been here for 20 years or 20 minutes. Tim also knew the many committee and support staff whose work brought them to the floor, as well as the many members of the Hill press corps who gathered in the Speaker's Lobby looking for news. All who worked with or around Tim appreciated his wit, his good humor, and his reliable information about what was really going on in the House. When the House was in legislative session, Tim was at that door--we could count on it. He always did his job diligently and magnificently, in the grandest traditions of the House.  Everyone who had the good fortune to know Tim Donohoe well agrees that he was one of the kindest, most selfless people one could ever meet. Though these traits may have resulted from a classical Catholic education, which for Tim culminated in a master's degree in theology from St. Paul's College in Washington, I suspect they were innate, simply a manifestation of Tim's character. He cared about others more than himself, and it showed.  Mr. Speaker, our world would be a far better place if there were more like Tim Donohoe. Our world is a better place for Tim's having been here. He is, and will continue to be, sorely missed.                          ____________________
