Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1314. Currently, not all 501(c) organizations are able to appeal decisions regarding the application for tax-exempt status; instead, the right to appeal depends on whether the application was processed inside the Internal Revenue Service.  This bill would give the right of an administrative appeal to all organizations that apply for tax-exempt status. It is a good, commonsense bill. I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1314, and I thank the chair of our full committee and the sponsor of this bill.  I reserve the balance of my time.
