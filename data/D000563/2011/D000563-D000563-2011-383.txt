His opinion of President Obama's stimulus is, it stopped a precipitous decline in our economy. Did it achieve all we had hoped for? No.  Mr. McCAIN.

The key adviser was Douglas Holtz-Akin, who is, as you know, former head of the CBO--the Senator knows him well--who had no brief whatsoever for that proposal.  Please go ahead.
