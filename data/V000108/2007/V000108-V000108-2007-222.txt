Both schools took 11th place in their divisions at the National Science Olympiad competition held in Wichita, KS. Valparaiso High School won medals in four events by finishing among the top six for that event while finishing in the top 10 in 10 of the tournament's 23 events.  The Science Olympiad began when Dr. Gerard J. Putz, Regional Science Consultant for Macomb County Intermediate School District in Michigan, decided to share the Science Olympiad program with Macomb County educators on March 29, 1982. The invitation was prompted by an article published in The Science Teacher in December 1977. After a few successful tournaments, Dr. Putz was convinced to share the program with the rest of the Nation, so the Science Olympiad program was presented to the Council of State Science Supervisors at the National Science Teachers Conference in Boston in 1984.  The mission of the Science Olympiad is ``to promote and improve student interest in science while improving the quality of K-12 science education throughout the nation.'' The purpose is to bring science to life and show how it works, to emphasize problem solving aspects, and to understand all of its concepts. The Science Olympiad teaches teamwork and cooperative learning strategies and promotes high levels of achievement and a commitment to excellence.  The 2007 Science Olympiad team from Valparaiso High School consists of: Lani Rush, Laurel Peterson, Sonia Phadke, Kristin Engerer, Katie Mika, Kate Sanders, Ruth Sanders, Rocio Rodea, Melissa Barrie Lehman, Ajay Major, Pat Skelton, Jon Gold, Mak Hozo, Schuyler DeArmond, Jeff Rinkenberger, Joe Kaminski, Ethan Kruse, Evan Gootee, and Gianni Galbiati. This team was under the outstanding guidance of coaches: Jim Young, Kristen Philipchuck and Kelly Woods. Several of these students received medals for their outstanding achievement. In Ecology, Jon Gold and Laurel Peterson received fourth place medals. Evan Gootee and Ruth Sanders received fourth place in Robot Ramble. The fifth place medal awarded for Entomology was given to Jon Gold and Lani Rush. Also taking fifth place medals in the subject of Write It, Do It were Ethan Kruse and Kate Sanders.  The Thomas Jefferson Middle School Science Olympiad team of 2007 consists of: Kati Manning, Jon Sherrick, Joe Galbiati, Julia Young, Matt Kerner, Kathryn Dalzotto, Josh Bartusch, Chris Haller, Karl Rinkenberger, Katalin Hartman, Alex Robinson-Norris, Maddie Woods, Katelyn Neis, Christian Briggs, and Jesse Bunchek, as well as student alternates: Brian Kingsbury, Adam Alamillo, Roshni Dhoot, Bennet Sanders, Cam Haskett, Nick Hartmann, and Daniel Karr. Guiding these exceptional students were coaches: Richard Bender, Carol Haller, Bill Dalzotto, Gwenn Rinkenberger, Mary Faith Dalzotto, Becky Juergens, Paul Huang, Lynda Galbiati, Diane Bernhardt, Molly JolI, Linda Cronk, and Mike Haller.  Several members of the Thomas Jefferson Middle School team were awarded medals for superior achievement. Kathryn Dalzotto and Katelyn Neis won third place in Anatomy. Kati Manning and Kathryn Dalzotto also took a third place medal for Wheeled Vehicle. A fourth place medal was awarded to Chris Haller and Karl Rinkenberger for their Balloon Launch Glider. For Mission Possible, Chris Haller, Kati Manning, and Katalin Hartman all took fifth place medals. Roads Scholar brought Jon Sherrick and Christian Briggs sixth place medals.  Madam Speaker, it is with great pride that I congratulate Valparaiso High School and Thomas Jefferson Middle School on their great achievement at the 23rd Annual Science Olympiad Tournament. I wish them continued success. These intelligent young students possess the work ethic and dedication that will make them successful leaders throughout their bright futures. I hope the rest of my colleagues will join with me in applauding the Science Olympiad teams for their commendable efforts.
