Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information. I share his view on that issue that whether or not we have a budget or not, the enforcement bill ought to come to the floor.  Can I ask him another question about that particular bill? Would the gentleman know or be inclined to assure us that we would have an alternative? As he knows, the dispute on the pay-as-you-go is whether it affects taxes as well as spending. We believe that is a very substantive issue that ought to be considered and voted upon by all the Members. Would the majority leader be inclined to ensure that that alternative will be in order for us to offer at the time, if it is not included in the bill that is reported out of committee, at the time it is considered on the floor?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?
