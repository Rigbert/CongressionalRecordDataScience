 President, I will pursue this more on Tuesday. I respectfully suggest that argument was based on a fallacy, and that is, the Stockpile Stewardship Program will not stay at zero until it is completed. We began this years ago. It is already working. We already use testing methods that do not require nuclear explosions.  The Senator will remember the chart James Schlesinger had with the arrows going up and down, and I quote from Dr. Sig Hecker, the Director of Los Alamos in 1997, whom everybody quotes these days, wrote a letter to the Senator from Arizona and said:       . . . there have been several instances since the cessation      of nuclear testing in September 1992, where we have found      problems . . . for which in the past we would have turned to      a nuclear test in the kiloton range to resolve. In the      absence of testing, we have used the methodology of      [Stockpile Stewardship] to evaluate the problem and suggest      fixes if required.       This has included more extensive calculations, non-nuclear      laboratory experiments, comparison to previous nuclear test      data, and the extensive experience of our designers and      engineers. Moreover, our assessment has been checked against      the rigors of peer review by the Lawrence Livermore National      Laboratory. We have examined several problems of this nature      during this year's certification cycle.       At this time, we have sufficient confidence in our      solutions to certify the stockpile without a resumption of      nuclear testing. If our confidence in the fixes were not      sufficiently high, we would not certify the stockpile.  He is no longer the lab Director, but I assume my colleagues all believe him to be an honorable man. When they say testing is not needed at this time--that is, the Directors--I ask my colleagues whether or not they agree with Jim Schlesinger, who said it is not needed at this time and he doubts it will be needed in the future.  Let me explain. We are using data from 1,000 past nuclear tests--as my friend says, from nonnuclear subcritical experiments and from high-tech simulations to understand what is happening and what may happen in the weapons stockpile.  Four facilities that will not be ready until 2005 are--they are called the National Ignition Facilities--a contained firing facility, dual-access radiographic hydrodynamics test facility, and the Atlas Plus power facilities. These facilities--and this is important--are all logical successors to older, less capable facilities. Our scientists are pushing the envelope but are not engaging in flights of fancy. That is why our labs and the Department of Energy are confident the National Ignition Facility will work, even though it has cost overruns. These facilities will serve several purposes and increase knowledge of basic physics of nuclear weapons. That new knowledge will lead to more accurate and precise computer simulations. The facilities can also be used to test the particular weapons problems. That is why I say our weapons will still be tested, even without full-scale nuclear weapons testing.  Another key tool we are developing is this advanced supercomputing accelerated strategic computing initiative, another generation of supercomputers that will be able to synthesize test data from the past, and all of the testing done on weapons components, to provide three-dimensional simulations of all aspects of nuclear weapons and how they react. Already, our scientists and engineers are working with industry and several universities to developcomputers that are capable of running more than 3 trillion operations per second. That is a new record level of computing power, and it gives us new safety.  Our goal, admittedly, over the next 5 years is for those supercomputers to be able to do 100 trillion operations per second. That is not something we need in our stockpile today. In fact, it represents a 100,000-fold increase in today's computational ability, and everybody says today's computational ability is sufficient to guarantee the stockpile. But when our weapons reach their so-called shelf life, then it is going to be needed, and we anticipate needing that sophisticated modeling. No one thinks that sophisticated modeling is needed now.  Finally, I have real questions about my colleagues' concern that the stockpile stewardship cannot work. Our scientists are the best in the world. They know what they are doing. They define scientific challenges that must meet the military performance and reliability standards. After defining these challenges, they believe they can meet them. I believe they know what they are talking about. But I see one problem. The one problem the Stockpile Stewardship Program faces now and in the future is that some may not fund it. That is what our colleagues at the laboratories are talking about.  Let me quote and conclude from a news release released today by the Department of Energy. I will submit it for the Record. It is ``For Immediate Release,'' dated October 8, 1999, and is a joint statement by Directors of three nuclear weapons laboratories--I note parenthetically that my guess is they probably read the New York Times article--C. Paul Robinson, Sandia; John C. Browne, Los Alamos; C. Bruce Tarter, Lawrence Livermore National Lab.  I will read only from the fourth paragraph:       While there can never be a guarantee that the stockpile      will remain safe and reliable indefinitely without nuclear      testing, we have stated that we are confident that a fully      supported and sustained stockpile stewardship program will      enable us to continue to maintain America's nuclear deterrent      without nuclear testing.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire statement be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  [From the DOE News, October 8, 1999]     Joint Statement by Three Nuclear Weapons Laboratory Directors (C. Paul Robinson, Sandia National Laboratories; John C. Browne, Los   Alamos National Laboratory; and C. Bruce Tarter, Lawrence Livermore                           National Laboratory)       ``We, the three nuclear weapons laboratory directors, have      been consistent in our view that the stockpile remains safe      and reliable today.       ``For the last three year, we have advised the Secretaries      of Energy and Defense through the formal annual certification      process that the stockpile remains safe and reliable and that      there is no need to return to nuclear testing at this time.       ``We have just forwarded our fourth set of certification      letters to the Energy and Defense Secretaries confirming our      judgment that once again the stockpile is safe and reliable      without nuclear testing.       ``While there can never be a guarantee that the stockpile      will remain safe and reliable indefinitely without nuclear      testing, we have stated that we are confident that a fully      supported and sustained stockpile stewardship program will      enable us to continue to maintain America's nuclear deterrent      without nuclear testing.       ``If that turns out not to be the case, Safeguard F--which      is a condition for entry into the Test Ban Treaty by the      U.S.--provides for the President, in consultation with the      Congress, to withdraw from the Treaty under the standard      ``supreme national interest'' clause in order to conduct      whatever testing might be required.''
