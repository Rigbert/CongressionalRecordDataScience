President, today Senator Brownback and I are introducing legislation that uses a simple, scientifically sound and entirely voluntary approach to combat global warming. It's not regulatory, and it's not revolutionary, except for the fact that this approach could account for and solve up to 50 percent of the United States' atmospheric carbon problem. The Carbon Sequestration and Reporting Act will expand the Nation's forested lands, protect watersheds, conserve agricultural lands and put forests and farms on the frontlines in the battle against global warming. The legislation is entirely voluntary and incentive-based. It makes new resources available to private landowners through State-operated revolving loan programs and USDA conservation programs to provide assistance for tree planting, other forest management actions, and soil conservation for the purposes of carbon sequestration. Both of these programs will lead to better water quality, less runoff pollution, better wildlife habitat and an additional revenue source for farmers and forest land owners.  Thirty-eight industrialized countries account for one-half of the carbon released into the atmosphere. The U.S., all alone, accounts for one-quarter of the total carbon released into the atmosphere. This country cannot afford to be a bystander on the climate change issue, and yet two days ago the headlines read: ``Climate Agreement Leaves U.S. Out in the Cold;'' ``Isolated on Global Warming;'' ``178 Nations Reach Climate Accord; U.S. Only Looks On.'' I am convinced that it is possible to put together a bipartisan alternative to inaction. I started that process with the Forest Resources for the Environment and Economy Act. Today, I continue that process with Senator Brownback as we introduce The Carbon Sequestration and Reporting Act.  We cannot afford to sit out this debate as it goes on around us. It costs between $2 and $20 per ton to store carbon in trees and soil but alternative strategies such as emissions reductions can cost up to $100 per ton. Sequestering carbon in forests and soil is a scientifically sound and cost-effective strategy that can reduce carbon dioxide levels by up to 50 percent. My approach has been to use trees for carbon sequestration; Senator Brownback's approach has been to sequester carbon in agricultural soil. Our legislation joins the best of both these approaches.  I am not saying that carbon sequestration should be the only tool in our toolbox. We need all the tools available to address the enormous issue of global climate change. But we believe this approach, this bill, will provide a jump start to a stalled political process. Carbon sequestration is a technology that can begin working right now, today, to reduce the negative effects of climate change.  Investing in healthy forests today is an investment in the well-being of ourplanet for decades to come. In the Pacific Northwest, forests are more than critical environmental resources, they are also a cornerstone of our economy. The same is true for agriculture. Last year, in Oregon alone, agriculture accounted for over $3 billion in trade and business revenues. Investing in improved land management and conservation to offset greenhouse gases is a win for the environment, a win for agriculture and a win for local economies.  According to the Pacific Forest Trust, our forest lands in the United States are only storing one-quarter of the carbon they can ultimately store. Just tapping a portion of this potential by expanding and increasing the productivity of the Nation's 737 million acres of forests is an important part of a win-win strategy to slow global warming. The forestry component of this bill works through a revolving loan fund for private, non-industrial landowners to be used to plant trees for carbon sequestration and conservation purposes. The forestry loans are not limited by time, but can be forgiven if the landowner decides to institute a permanent easement on his or her land for the purposes of conservation and carbon sequestration. This bill also takes an important first step toward sequestering greenhouse gases on Federal lands: it directs the Forest Service to report to Congress on options to increase carbon storage in our national forests.  The agriculture portion of the bill will encourage landowners to offer the best plans detailing practices they would be willing to undertake to store additional carbon in the soil. The program is limited to 5 million acres, and is not a set aside. Rather, this bill encourages conservation practices like no-till, buffer strips and biomass production, to name a few, which are known to enhance soils' ability to store carbon. Using funding similar to current CRP payments, the agricultural contracts under this bill would be for a minimum of 10 years and USDA would be required--in conjunction with other agencies--to finalize criteria for measuring the carbon-storing ability of various conservation practices.  We know these types of approaches work because of the leadership of our home states in carbon sequestration practice and research: Oregon for forestry and agriculture and Kansas for agriculture. The objectives of this bill will be greatly aided by institutions like Oregon State University and Kansas State University, who are already conducting significant research on various carbon-storing practices.  This bill also makes important changes to the Energy Policy Act of 1992: it would strengthen the voluntary accounting and verification of greenhouse gas reductions from forestry and agricultural activities. The bill directs the Secretary of Energy to develop new guidelines on accurate and cost-effective methods to account for and report real and credible greenhouse gas reductions. These guidelines are absolutely necessary because without them we could be doing all the environmental good in the world, but we have no record of it and, therefore, no concept of the progress we would have made. The guidelines will be developed with the input of a new Advisory Council representing agriculture, industry, foresters, States, and environmental groups.  As in the last Congress, the forestry portion of the bill will pay for itself by using money that polluters pay when they are caught violating the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act as there are currently no guarantees that these penalties, which revert to the General Fund, are used to improve our environment, but our bill would put the penalties toward this goal. We would use these fines to expand our forests, protect streams and rivers and help remove greenhouse gases from the air. The agricultural portion of this bill will be paid for by conservation appropriations to the USDA.  This bill is about taking advantage of a clear win-win opportunity. It's a win for the global environment. It's a win for sustainable forestry. It's a win for local water protection. And it's a win for rural communities. For these reasons, the forestry portion of this bill has already received positive reactions from timber companies and environmental organizations alike, including the National Association of State Foresters and the Society of American Foresters, American Forest and Paper Association, American Forests, Environmental Defense, Governor John A. Kitzhaber of Oregon, PacifiCorp, The Nature Conservancy, and The Pacific Forest Trust. The agricultural portion of this bill has received positive reactions from many of these same groups.  I look forward to pursuing this common-sense step toward protecting the environment and supporting our forest workers and agricultural interests.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a summary of the Carbon Sequestration and Reporting Act be printed in the Record.

This bill is a combination of two previously      introduced bills, S. 820 and S. 785, introduced by Senators      Wyden and Brownback respectively.       Title I: Carbon Advisory Council: Guidelines for Accurate      Carbon Accounting for Forests. The bill directs the Secretary      of Energy and the Secretary of Agriculture, through the      Forest Service, to establish scientifically-based guidelines      for accurate reporting, monitoring, and verification of      carbon storage from forest management actions. The bill      establishes a multi-stakeholder Carbon and Forestry Advisory      Council to assist USDA in developing the guidelines.       Title II: Forest Carbon Management: State Revolving Loan      Programs/Cooperative Agreements. The bill provides assistance      to plant and manage underproducing or understocked forests to      increase carbon sequestration by authorizing a state-run      revolving loan program. Assistance is provided through      Cooperative Agreements with State or local governments,      American Indian Tribes, Alaska natives, native Hawaiians, and      private-nonprofit entities; or through loans to nonindustrial      private forest landowners. The Federal share of funding for      Cooperative Agreements and the loan program will come from      penalties that are being assessed against violators of the      Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act (civil penalties      assessed in FY 1998 totaled $45 million).       Title III: Carbon Sequestration Program: Agriculture      Conservation Program. The bill authorizes USDA contracts for      a minimum of 10 years for farmers who wish to conserve land,      improve water quality and sequester carbon by employing      conservation practices, like no-till farming and the use of      buffer strips to enhance carbon sequestration. The USDA would      be required--in conjunction with other agencies--to finalize      criteria for measuring the carbon-storing ability of various      conservation practices. This bill allows farmers to submit      plans on how they would store carbon on their land.      Landowners already employing carbon-conservation practices      would also be eligible. Participation in this program is      completely voluntary, and is limited to 20 million total      acres at a maximum $20 per acre.       Title IV Reports: Report on Options to Increase Carbon      Storage on Federal Lands: The bill directs the Secretary of      Agriculture, through the Forest Service, to report to      Congress on forestry options to increase carbon storage in      the National Forest System. Forestry and Agriculture      Reporting: This bill will provide for a documented carbon      database reported by participants to the Administrator of      Energy Information Administration. The Administrator shall      develop forms to keep track of both domestic and      international sequestration gains. This data will provide a      road map for dealing with climate change through independent      carbon market offsets in the future.                                 ______                                       By
