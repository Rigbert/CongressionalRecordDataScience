 The last figure that I saw was that at a time when the CEO's are seeing tremendous increases in their incomes and workers incomes are declining, the gap is now 150 to one. I do not think, you used the words economic democracy a moment ago, I do not think that is what this country is supposed to be. It is not supposed to be an oligarchy. It is supposed to be a country in which we have a solid middle class where people who are working for a living are able to earn enough money to pay the bills and to raise their kids with a little bit of dignity.  I think we should also point out, because the media does not do this terribly often, that one of the reasons that European and Scandinavian companies are coming to the United States today is that they find in America today the opportunity, unbelievable as it may sound, to hire cheap labor. For the same reason that American companies go to Mexico and China, some of the European companies are coming to America where you can get skilled, hard-working people who will work for 7 bucks an hour, $8 an hour, with very limited benefits. And clearly in Europe, workers earn a lot more than that.  I think another point that I want to make, there was an article in, I think it was Newsweek recently, maybe it was Time, where they talked about the stress that the average American family is under. People are working longer and longer hours, having less vacation time. I think that is an issue that we should address as well.
