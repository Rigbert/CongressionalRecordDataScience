Chairman, I would inquire of the Chair, I stood up before to ask for additional time as the ranking member of the subcommittee and could not get additional time. I wish to personally speak in favor of the Sanders amendment. Do I understand the procedures here to disallow me, as ranking member, the highest member of my party on this committee, from being allowed to speak on behalf of this amendment? Is there no procedure available to me to use today because of this unrealistic time limitation?
