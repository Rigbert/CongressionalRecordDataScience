Speaker, it is pretty simple. They are talking about destroying the system to save it; moving toward a privatized, sink-or-swim, on-your-own system, but there is one simple fact. If we just lifted the cap and said every American will pay the same amount of Social Security tax on all of their wages, that sounds pretty fair to me. It is not progressive, even. It is not. We are not saying low income people will pay less, we are saying everybody would pay the same amount on every dollar, and that would provide more than enough money to make Social Security solvent beyond the 75-year window.  But I went a step further in my bill. I said okay, I like that, that is pretty good. We do not have to cut benefits, raise the retirement age or do things that hurt working people, and we do not have to roll the dice on some sort of individualized accounts, which have not worked out real well in Great Britain and in Chili, but what we could do also is exempt the first $4,000 of income. I would like to give a little tax relief.  So the plan I have would lift the cap and use some of that money to provide tax relief by exempting the first $4,000 of income for self-employed and for wage-earning Americans who pay FICA taxes.  Now, guess what that means? That means 95 percent of the people in the United States of America who work for wages would get a tax cut, and they would still collect their full Social Security. But 5 percent, those who earn over $76,600 a year, would pay the same amount as the other people who earn less than them.  Now, would that not be a fairer way to fix Social Security?
