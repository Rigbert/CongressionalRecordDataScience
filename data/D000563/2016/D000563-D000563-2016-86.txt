President, I was necessarily absent from this afternoon's vote on confirmation of the nomination of Peter Michael McKinley to be Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the United States of America to the Federative Republic of Brazil.  On vote No. 137, had I been present, I would have voted yea on the McKinley nomination. I hope the Senate will continue to confirm President Obama's highly qualified nominees in the weeks ahead.                          ____________________
