 President, let me be very clear and say that this fight--what some of us see on our TV screens and what we hear from some politicians--the simple truth is that Social Security is not going broke. Social Security is not going broke. Today, Social Security has a $2.8 trillion surplus in its trust fund and can pay out all benefits to all beneficiaries, the elderly and the disabled, for the next 18 years.  This is not the opinion of Senator Bernie Sanders. This is the opinion of the Social Security Administration in their latest report. There is and can be no debate about these simple facts. If we rebalance funds, as President Obama and many others have proposed, all benefits--retiree benefits for our older Americans and disabled benefits for disabled Americans--would be paid out for the next 18 years--the next 18 years.  So people who come before you and say Social Security is going broke, they are simply not telling the truth. While this 18-year period makes it clear that we do not have an imminent crisis with regard to Social Security, I do agree with those who want to make sure Social Security is solvent for a lot longer than 18 years, for our kids and for our grandchildren.  Frankly, when we talk about the long-term solvency of Social Security, and that of course includes disability insurance as well, there are two basic approaches we can take for those who want to extend Social Security for many decades. One approach is what many of my Republican colleagues are talking about. What they are saying, in essence, is that in order to save Social Security we have to cut Social Security. Some are talking about a so-called chained CPI, which would mean a cut in cost-of-living adjustments, some are talking about raising the retirement age, at which point seniors will be able to get benefits, and some in fact are talking about privatizing Social Security and giving that program over to Wall Street. That is one approach. That is one way we could deal with Social Security and the future of the program. Needless to say that is an approach I very strongly disagree with.  The other approach, an approach which is widely supported in poll after poll by the American people, extends Social Security and protects Social Security in a very different way than many Republicans are proposing; that is, it addresses the issue that right now, as most Americans know, there is a cap on the income that is subject to the Social Security payroll tax.  That cap is now at $118,500; in other words, one individual makes $11.8 million a year but only pays 6.2 percent on the first $118,500 he earns. The second individual makes $118,500 and pays Social Security taxes on all of that income. That, I think most Americans believe, is patently unfair.  I have introduced legislation in the past, and I am now working with other Senators who have introduced similar types of legislation which eliminates the cap on income subject to the Social Security payroll tax. My own view is we should apply the Social Security payroll tax to income above $250,000.  If we do that, if we go down that very simple and fair route of asking very wealthy individuals--the top 1 percent, the top 1\1/2\ percent--to contribute more into the Social Security trust fund, the fact is we could extend Social Security for decades, disability benefits for decades, and in fact we would have enough money to expand benefits, not cut them.  On March 19, 2013, in response to a letter I wrote to the Social Security Chief Actuary, he wrote back and he told us that taking the approach my legislation lays out, raising the cap on taxable income starting at $250,000, would extend the life of Social Security past the year 2060.  So for anybody to come on this floor and say in order to save Social Security we have to cut benefits, at a time when millions of senior citizens in this country are struggling to pay for the medicine they need, to keep warm in the winter, to buy the food they need, people out there living on $13,000, $14,000 a year--and there are some who say we have to cut Social Security--let me go on record and say I strongly disagree.  The far better and far fairer approach is to lift the cap on taxable income and start at $250,000. So if we are serious about extending the life of Social Security, if we are serious about not cutting disability benefits, there is a path forward. Yes, it does ask the people on top to contribute a little bit more. I know that with all of the lobbyists and all the campaign contributions coming in here that sometimes becomes tough, but it is the right thing to do.  Let's stand with the millions of seniors who are struggling to stay alive economically in these tough times, rather than wealthy campaign contributors.  I ask unanimous consent that the March 19, 2013, letter from the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   Social Security Administration,                                  Office of the Chief Actuary,                                    Baltimore, MD, March 19, 2013.     Hon. Bernie Sanders,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Sanders: I am writing in response to your      request for estimates of the financial effects on Social      Security of a proposal to apply the Social Security payroll      tax to earned income over $250,000 beginning in 2014. The      estimates and analysis provided in this letter reflect the      intent, as discussed with Warren Gunnels of your staff, of S.      500, ``Keeping Our Social Security Promises Act,'' which you      introduced on March 7, 2013.       We estimate that enactment of this Bill would extend full      solvency of the OASDI program for an additional 28 years,      with the projected depletion of combined OASI and DI Trust      Fund reserves moving from 2033 under current law to 2061      under the proposal. All estimates are based on the      intermediate assumptions of the 2012 Trustees Report. The      estimates presented reflect the combined efforts of many in      our office, but particularly Alice Wade, Christopher      Chaplain, Dan Nickerson, Kyle Burkhalter, Katie Sutton, and      William Piet. A detailed description of our understanding of      the intent of the Bill is included immediately below.       The intent of this proposal is identical to the Bill you      introduced in September 2011 and H.R. 797 introduced in the      House of Representatives in February 2011 by Mr. DeFazio. Our      earlier estimates for both of these Bills, reflecting      baseline assumptions from the 2011 and 2010 Trustees Reports,      respectively, are available at http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/solvency/index.html.       S. 500 would modify the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to      subject a worker's OASDI covered earnings in excess of      $250,000 in any calendar year after 2013 to the combined      OASDI payroll tax rate of 12.4 percent. This is the same tax      rate that is applied, under current law, to OASDI covered      earnings up to the contribution and benefit base ($113,700      for 2013). Under present law, the contribution and benefit      base is scheduled to increase in the future based on      increases in the average wage in the U.S. economy. However,      the threshold of $250,000 would be constant after 2014 until      the contribution and benefit base exceeds this level (in the      year 2033), at which point the threshold would be set equal      to the contribution and benefit base for that and all      subsequent years. Earnings subject to tax above the threshold      would not be included in earnings credited for the purpose of      OASDI benefit computation.       All wages and self-employment earnings in OASDI covered      employment during a given year would be reflected in the      determination of earnings above the threshold. For workers      with more than one employer (including self employment) for a      given year, total tax liability for the year would be      computed as if all earnings had been received from a single      employer for the year, but in no case would any employee or      employer pay less tax than they would under current law. To      the extent adjustments of payroll tax liability are needed      for a given year, employees would make such adjustments on      their income tax filing forms. SSA would contact employers      regarding any additional tax liability due to multiple jobs      for employees during the year.       The balance of this letter provides summary and detailed      estimates of the effects of enactment of the proposal.                 summary of effects on actuarial status       Figure 1 illustrates the expected change in the combined      Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) and Disability      Insurance (DI) Trust Fund reserves, expressed as a percent of      annual program cost, assuming enactment of this Bill.      Assuming enactment, the OASDI program would be expected to be      fully solvent for an additional 28 years, under the      intermediate assumptions of the 2012 Trustees Report.       The level of reserves for the theoretical combined OASI and      DI Trust Funds would decline from 340 percent of annual      program cost at the beginning of 2012 until these reserves      would become depleted in 2061 (28 years later than projected      depletion under current law). At the time of reserve      depletion in 2061, the program would be able to pay about 91      percent of then scheduled benefits with continuing taxes      (under current law, 75 percent of scheduled benefits are      projected to be payable in 2033 after depletion). By 2086, 88      percent of benefits scheduled under the proposal would be      payable compared to 73 percent of scheduled benefits payable      under present law.       Enactment of this Bill would eliminate about 80 percent of      the long-range OASDI actuarial deficit of 2.67 percent of      taxable payroll under current law, lowering the OASDI      actuarial deficit to 0.55 percent of payroll for the long-     range period.       Figure 2 illustrates annual projected levels of cost,      expenditures, and non-interest income as a percent of the      current-law taxable payroll. The projected levels of cost      reflect the full cost of scheduled benefits under both      present law and the proposal. After trust fund reserve      depletion, projected expenditures under current law and under      the proposal include only amounts payable from projected tax      revenues (non-interest income), which are less than projected      cost.       Figure 2 shows that the estimated cost of the OASDI program      would be very slightly reduced under this proposal. A slight      decrease in benefits is projected to follow from a small      decrease in the proportion of employee compensation that      would be paid in the form of wages under the current-law      contribution and benefit base. This small reduction in wages      as a percentage of employee compensation reflects the assumed      behavioral response of employees and employers to the      additional payroll taxes under the proposal.       It is also useful to consider the projected cost and income      for the OASDI program expressed as a percentage of Gross      Domestic Product (GDP). The graph illustrates these levels      under both present law and this proposal.                       detailed financial results                         Benefit Illustrations       Benefit illustrations are not provided for the proposal      because benefit levels would not be materially changed from      the scheduled benefit levels under current law.                         Trust Fund Operations       Table 1 shows the annual cost and income rates, annual      balances, and trust fund ratios (reserves as percent of      annual program cost) for OASDI assuming enactment of the      proposal. This table also shows the change from present law      in these cost rates, income rates, and balances. Included at      the bottom of this table are summarized rates for the 75-year      (long-range) period.       Table 1 indicates that the OASDI program is projected to be      solvent for an additional 28 years assuming enactment of the      proposal. The year in which the combined reserves of the OASI      and DI Trust Funds are projected to deplete would change from      2033 under current law to 2061 under the proposal. Even after      depletion of the trust fund reserves, however, the actuarial      status of the program is improved as continuing income would      be sufficient to pay a higher percentage of scheduled      benefits than under current law. Under current law, 75      percent of benefits are projected to be payable at trust fund      reserve depletion in 2033, declining to 73 percent payable by      2086. Under this proposal, 100 percent of the scheduled      benefits would be fully payable through 2060, and 91 percent      would be payable at trust fund reserve depletion in 2061,      declining to 88 percent payable by 2086.       The actuarial deficit for the OASDI program over the 75-     year projection period is reduced by 2.12 percent of taxable      payroll, from an actuarial deficit of 2.67 percent of payroll      under current law to an actuarial deficit estimated at 0.55      percent of taxable payroll under the proposal.       We project annual balances (annual income rate minus annual      cost rate) to become positive for years 2014 through 2021      under the proposal and to be negative thereafter. Annual      deficits (negative annual balances) after 2028 are projected      to be smaller than the deficits projected under current law      by more than 2 percentage points through 2086.                  Program Transfers and Asset Reserves       Column 4 of Table 1a provides a projection of the level of      reserves for the theoretical combined OASI and DI Trust Funds      under the proposal, expressed in present value dollars      discounted to January 1, 2012. The table indicates that the      proposal includes no new specified transfers of general      revenue to the trust funds. For purpose of comparison, the      OASDI Trust Fund reserves, expressed in present value      dollars, are also shown for the current-law Social Security      program both without the added general fund transfers (if      any) provided under the proposal (column 6) and with the      proposal added transfers (column 7). Note that negative      values in columns 4, 6, and 7 represent the ``unfunded      obligation'' for the program through the year. The unfunded      obligation is the present value of the shortfall of revenue      needed to pay full scheduled benefits on a timely basis from      the date of trust fund reserve depletion to the end of the      indicated year. Gross Domestic Product (GDP), expressed in      present value dollars, is shown in column 5 for comparison      with other values in the table.                      Effect on the Federal Budget       Table 1b shows the projected effect, in present value      discounted dollars, on the Federal budget (unified-budget and      on-budget) cash flows and balances, assuming enactment of      proposal. Table 1b.n provides the estimated nominal dollar      effect of enactment of the proposal on the annual budget      balances for years 2012 through 2022. All values in these      tables represent the amount of the change from the level      projected under current law.       The effect of the proposal on unified budget cash flow      (column 3) is expected to be positive starting for 2014,      reflecting the application of the payroll tax to earnings      above the current-law taxable maximum amount.       Column 4 of Table 1b indicates that the projected effect of      implementing this Bill is a reduction, starting in 2014, of      the Federal debt held by the public, reaching about $7.2      trillion in present value by 2086. Column 5 provides the      projected effect of the proposal on the annual unified budget      balances, including both the cash flow effect in column 3 and      the additional interest on the accumulated debt indicated in      column 4. Columns 6 and 7 indicate that the proposal would      have no expected direct effects on the on-budget cash flow,      or on the total Federal debt, in the future.       It is important to note that these estimates are based on      the intermediate assumptions of the 2012 Trustees Report and      thus are not consistent with estimates made by the Office of      Budget and Management or the Congressional Budget Office      based on their assumptions.          Annual Trust Fund Operations as a Percentage of GDP       Table 1c provides annual cost, annual expenditures (on a      payable basis), and annual tax income for the OASDI program      expressed as a percentage of GDP. These values are shown for      both present law and assuming enactment of the Bill. Showing      the annual trust fund flows as a percent of GDP provides an      additional perspective on these trust fund operations in      relation to the total value of goods and services produced in      the United States. The relationship between income and cost      is similar when expressed as a percent of GDP to that when      expressed as a percent of taxable payroll (see Table 1).        Effects on Trust Fund Reserves and Unfunded Obligations       Table 1d provides estimates of the changes due to the      proposal in the level of projected trust fund reserves under      present law and, for years after trust fund exhaustion, the      level of unfunded obligations under present law. All values      in the table are expressed in present-value discounted      dollars. For the 75-year long-range period as a whole, the      present-law unfunded obligation of $8.6 trillion in present      value is reduced to an unfunded obligation of $1.4 trillion      in present value. This change is the combination of the      following:       A $7.1 trillion increase in revenue from applying the      payroll tax to covered earnings above the present-law      contribution and benefit base (column 2), less       A $0.1 trillion reduction in cost from the behavioral      response to additional payroll tax, causing a small decrease      in the share of employee compensation that is received in      wages, and thus a small decrease in total benefits (column      3).       We hope these estimates will be helpful. Please let me know      if we may provide further assistance.           Sincerely,                                                  Stephen C. Goss,                                                    Chief Actuary.
