Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate and express my thanks to the National Environmental Education Foundation, and the more than 180,000 volunteers lending their time and talent to the 18th annual National Public Lands Day. Mr. Speaker, this will be the largest, single-day volunteer effort for public lands in the United States. Eight federal agencies will participate along with more than 250 state, county, and city partners and a host of nonprofit groups. At parks, beaches, wildlife preserves and forests around the country, dedicated citizens will work to improve and restore the places that we all use for recreation, education, exercise and relaxation.  One such site, Mr. Speaker, is very dear to me. The Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site will see at least 300 volunteers weed, paint and place mulch around Dr. King's first home and the adjacent properties. I am so proud and grateful for the work they do in my district and in our country.  I am sorry I can't be with them on this special day, but I think it is appropriate that we recognize them from this great Chamber of public service. National Public Lands Day celebrates volunteerism and the importance of recreation and public lands to community health, so I think it is appropriate that we celebrate them. I hope all my colleagues will join with me in wishing the volunteers good health and a blessed event.                          ____________________
