Chairman, my good friend the gentleman from Texas has just spoken very actively, strongly. Our substitute does exactly what hewants done. It precludes, as does the gentleman's amendment from Kentucky, the expenditure of any funds from either the Social Security trust fund or the Medicare fund. What it does not do is say Employees, tough luck, get out of town. We're not going to let you organize, we're not going to let you follow the Federal law, which precludes, by the way, any official time being used to conduct internal union matters, organizing workers, soliciting members for conducting union elections or for any partisan political activities. That is precluded by Federal law right now.  What is not precluded is activity that is funded in the private sector, as the gentleman from Massachusetts indicated, but allows employees to represent their fellow employees and to work with management on official time to make their jobs better, more efficient and more productive.  The concern that has been raised, that is, of spending money out of the trust fund, is agreed to on this side by our substitute. What is not agreed to is the obvious underlying intent, and that is to undermine the workers' ability to have effective representation, period.  For that reason, I would ask Members on both sides of the aisle, particularly those who voted for the TEAM Act on the theory that management could include employees for the purpose of sitting down, discussing and negotiating working conditions and objectives and ways and means. That was the issue in the TEAM Act.  If you believed that, if it was not just a subterfuge to undermine the ability of workers to organize, then you ought to support this substitute, and I urge all the Members of the House to do so.
