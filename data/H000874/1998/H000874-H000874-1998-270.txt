I want to, first of all, say that I have the highest respect for the gentlemen from Michigan and Florida and congratulate them on this effort. I will support this bill. I toyed with frankly opposing the bill, but after discussing it with the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin) and knowing of the concerns of the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Shaw), I am going to support this bill. I think it is a reasonable, rational thing probably to do.  I think that we are sincere in doing this, and we are trying to do something that will not harm children while at the same time continuing incentives in place.  Madam Chairman, the States have had 10 years to get their computer systems together. Yet here they are asking Congress not only for an extension, but while we are at it, could we throw in reduced penalties, too. In talking to my very distinguished friend and colleague, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cardin) who sits on this committee, I think we are correct in reducing these penalties. My own State very frankly, Madam Chairman, is concerned about this bill and perhaps would not like to see it passed, and do not want any penalties. I do not share the view of my State on this issue.  I have practiced law for over a quarter of a century. I practiced in the courts of Prince George's County in Maryland. I handled a lot of domestic cases in that process and sat in the courtroom not only with my own clients, but watched other nonsupport cases come before the courts. I saw time after time after time a wink and a nod at parents who did not meet their responsibilities, who did not support their children, who had children, thought it was a spectator sport and thought they would pass the cost on to the rest of us.                              {time}  1230  That was despicable and is despicable. God gives us a great blessing when he gives us children and we ought to take the responsibility to ensure that they are fed and housed and clothed properly. There are too many Americans who do not do that. This ought to be a priority item for every State and for every administrator to make sure that child support is collected. Far too little of it is collected now. It is not that I resent sharing in the costs to help those children in need. None of us begrudge them the help. But all of us, I think, ought to be and are angry at those parents who can but do not support their children. In an age of computers and information technology, we ought to be capable of identifying and going after those who owe their children, not just society but their children the responsibility that parenthood places upon them.  Again, Madam Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Shaw) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin) for their leadership on this issue. It is obvious that we have a practical problem, it is obvious that we want to go ahead, and it is obvious that we continue to keep in effect incentives to get on line so that we will get at deadbeat parents.  I thank the Chair for her not tapping the gavel as soon as she might otherwise have done. This is an important issue, not just this bill, but we need to as a Congress and as a Nation focus on enforcing and expecting responsibility of parents towards their children.
