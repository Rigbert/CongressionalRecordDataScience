 He has been nominated to fill the vacancy left by Judge O'Scannlain. Mr. Bounds once served as a law clerk to Ninth Circuit Judge O'Scannlain.  Mr. Bounds is highly qualified to serve on the Ninth Circuit. A native of Oregon, he attended Stanford University and Yale Law School. He has dedicated his career to public service and has served in government for the past 14 years. The last 8 years were as an assistant U.S. attorney in Oregon.  I have listened to my colleagues on the other side voice their opposition to Mr. Bounds. Interestingly, none of them cite anything Mr. Bounds has done in his legal career as a reason for opposing his nomination. Instead, they focus on two things. First, they say we shouldn't confirm Mr. Bounds because his home State Senators didn't return their blue slips. Second, they say some of Mr. Bounds' college writings were insensitive. So I am going to start with point No. 1 on which they base their opposition to him.  As I have explained so many times on the floor of the U.S. Senate and in the Senate Judiciary Committee--and I don't know how many times to the multitudes of journalists who are on the Hill--my blue-slip policy is the same as all but 2 of my 18 predecessors who were chairmen of the Judiciary Committee over the 100-year history of blue slips. Like Chairmen Ted Kennedy, Joe Biden, and Orrin Hatch, I will hold hearings for circuit court nominees who have negative or unreported blue slips if the White House has consulted with the home State Senators, and I will not allow Senators to abuse the blue-slip courtesy for political or ideological reasons.  In the case of Mr. Bounds, the White House sought the Oregon Senators' input, seriously considered the one candidate suggested by the Oregon Senators, and waited several months for the Senators from Oregon to establish their judicial selection committee, which is quite a tradition in that State. The selection committee itself even recommended Mr. Bounds. Yet the Oregon Senators still didn't return their blue slips.  They say it was because Mr. Bounds didn't disclose some of his college writings to the selection committee. There is a very good reason he didn't--the selection committee never asked for his college writings. In fact, Senator Wyden's staff instructed Mr. Bounds not to disclose them. Moreover, the Oregon Senators refused to ever meet with Mr. Bounds during this whole process.  It has been misleadingly said this will be the first time in modern history we will have confirmed a judge without there having been at least one positive blue slip from the two State Senators. My Democratic colleagues have only themselves to blame. The way the blue slip used to be enforced was through the 60-vote filibuster, and that was done away with in November 2013, led by the then-Democratic majority and Senator Reid.  For example, Chairman Hatch held hearings for five nominees in 2003 and 2004, despite there being the lack of a positive blue slip from either home State Senator. These nominees were voted out of committee. Then Senate Democrats blocked these nominees on the floor by using the 60-vote filibuster. But my Democratic colleagues abolished that filibuster, as I said, in 2013 for the reason that they needed the votes and the freedom to pack the DC Circuit with liberal judges who would uphold Obama's regulatory schemes.  Leading this effort was none other than Senator Merkley of Oregon, who argued that 41 Senators shouldn't be able to block a Senate majority from confirming judges. Now they have a different point of view. Now he argues that he alone should have the right to block Mr. Bounds from even getting a hearing in the Judiciary Committee.  In November of 2013, I told my Democratic colleagues that they would regret abolishing the filibuster just to stack the DC Circuit Court of Appeals with their friends. Now, obviously, today, as they consider the Bounds nomination, they know they made a mistake.  Turning to the only other criticism my colleagues have made about Mr. Bounds, which is in regard to his college writings, I don't believe that misguided statements made in a college newspaper 25 years ago should disqualify Mr. Bounds. I hope we don't live in a world where controversial things that we write in college end our careers forever. This is especially true with our kids and grandkids now in the era of social media.  For example, a few years ago, just when the same thing came up on Justice Wright going to the MinnesotaDistrict Court, I voted and supported her despite very controversial writings she had in law school. We shouldn't assume that views expressed years ago during college and law school represent the nominee today.  Mr. Bounds testified that he regretted much of what he wrote in those op-eds.  We received numerous letters in support of Mr. Bounds' nomination from people who have known him personally throughout his life. We received a letter from some of his classmates at Stanford. And before I quote, it is kind of like--these sound like they were his friends in the dormitories. I never was a dormitory student, but I imagine you really get acquainted with people there. This is what they had to say about Mr. Bounds:       We have become aware of a handful of controversial op-eds      and articles Ryan wrote for The Stanford Review during that      time. None of us believes that these writings reflect Ryan's      character, either then or now. All of us remember our dorm-     mate fondly.       We are a diverse bunch. Yet Ryan never failed to treat all      of us with courtesy, respect, and civility, regardless of our      respective genders, sexual orientations, skin colors,      religions, ethnicity, or any other characteristics.       There is not, and never has been, a racist, sexist,      homophobic, or bigoted bone in Ryan Bounds's body.  Mr. Bounds has also been a community leader, promoting diversity and equality. As a member of the Multnomah Bar Association's Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Committee, Mr. Bounds spearheaded programs to expose underprivileged young people to the legal profession. He mentored young scholarship recipients and helped those same people navigate law school admissions and law school. He expanded low-cost CLE offerings and organized anti-harassment and anti-discrimination training.  Mr. Bounds is imminently qualified to serve on the Ninth Circuit. His college writings do not represent who he is today. His professional accomplishments and exemplary public service speak much more loudly to his character and integrity.  I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support Mr. Bounds' confirmation today.                     Nomination of Brett Kavanaugh  Madam President, I would like to say one thing about another nomination issue. I understand that so far, no Senate Democrat has met with Judge Kavanaugh. They are apparently awaiting their marching orders from the minority leader. Well, the American people elected each one of those Democratic Senators to represent them, not the minority leader. And when Senate Democrats have largely already made up their minds to vote against Judge Kavanaugh and none of them have even met with him, their demand for a paper chase beyond relevant material sounds more and more like a demand for a taxpayer-funded fishing expedition.                      Remembering Governor Bob Ray  Now, Madam President, I would like to address my colleagues in the U.S. Senate on the life and death of Governor Bob Ray, a wonderful Governor for the State of Iowa over a long period of time. I wish to honor him in this way.  I wish to pay tribute to my good friend and an exceptional Iowan whose life and legacy will be remembered in my home State for generations to come. As the people of Iowa mourn the loss of our 38th Governor, I would like to share about a few ways that Robert D. Ray made Iowa a better place to grow. Looking back at his lifetime of service, it seems nearly impossible that one person could wear so many hats and reach the highest rungs of distinguished service in both his private life and in the public sector.  After graduating from high school in 1946, Bob enlisted in the U.S. Army to serve his country that way. He returned from service and earned undergraduate and law degrees at Drake University in Des Moines, IA. He married the love of his life, Billie, and together they raised three daughters.  In addition to serving 14 years as our State's chief executive from 1969 to 1983, Governor Ray also served as our State party chairman at the age of 35, chairman of the National Governors Association, interim mayor of Des Moines, 11th president of Drake University, U.S. delegate to the United Nations Conference on Refugees, and CEO and board member to a number of nonprofit and for-profit corporations.  Reading such an outstanding resume, one might come to the conclusion that this Iowan must have an outsized ego to match. To that, I can personally affirm that Bob Ray was a humble leader driven by a servant's heart. He brought honesty, dignity, and integrity to the campaign trail and, in turn, to State government.  His policy achievements as our 38th Governor made government work better for the people by reorganizing State government, such as the creation of the department of transportation, and modernizing the National Guard. Those are just a few of the reorganizations. But through doing this, he strengthened rock-solid Iowa values in education, conservation, good government, and fiscal stewardship. It was Governor Ray who signed Iowa's--we call it the bottle bill. You get a redemption for a can you return instead of throwing it in the dump. He signed it into law to keep our roadways clean and our State looking beautiful.  Arguably, the lasting measure of his governorship is defined by moral leadership, and particularly as evidenced after the fall of Saigon in 1975.  As a result of the ending of the Vietnam war, Governor Ray's actions transcended the riverbanks of America's heartland to reach thousands of refugees across the world. Those refugees were fleeing communism in Southeast Asia. Governor Ray persuaded President Ford to allow Iowa to welcome the Tai Dam to Iowa, allowing this close-knit ethnic group to stay intact and to resettle in Iowa.  In 1978, we had another wave of Southeast Asians who were desperate to escape communism in South Vietnam. They became known as the boat people who put their lives in peril for the pearl of freedom that we offer in America. Bob Ray put his political life on the line to open Iowa's homes and hearts to rescue them from suffering and death. In so doing, he saved the lives of thousands of people, including generations of new Iowans yet to be born.  Yet again, Governor Ray responded in 1979 to another humanitarian crisis going on in Southeast Asia by launching the Iowa SHARES Program. The acronym ``SHARES'' stands for Iowa ``Sends Help to Aid Refugees and End Starvation.'' That very first year, the program raised more than $600,000 in less than 1 month--small donations to send food and medicine to starving people on the Cambodian border. Volunteer nurses and doctors from Iowa also went to save these people, who suffered under the harsh Khmer Rouge regime of Pol Pot.  When one of those members of the boat people first learned of Governor Ray's passing, she was moved to tears. Now a wife and mother of five children, she prayed for Governor Ray, in fact referring to him as ``Saint Bob Ray.'' She attributed his courage and generosity to saving thousands of people just like her.  At his funeral, Senator Ernst and I saw a whole part of the church filled with these Southeast Asians who very much wanted to express their appreciation for Governor Ray's leadership by being there at that funeral.  In 2005, Governor Ray received Iowa's highest civilian honor, the Iowan Award. It is a well-deserved honor for this legendary man of honor. He is a statesman, a humanitarian hero, and, of course, to those who loved him the most, he was a husband, dad, and grandpa.  Years after Governor Ray left the Governor's mansion, called Terrace Hill, he launched the Robert D. and Billie Ray Center at Drake University. That center's mission is dedicated to improving civility and developing ethical leaders at home and throughout the world. And for all of us, we know that in a society less civil now than it has been throughout most of the history of our country, that center is going to serve a very needed purpose. For those who know the story of Bob Ray, his ray of light connected with the center will inspire generations of leaders for years to come.  Barbara and I join our fellow Iowans in extending our condolences to Billie and the entire Ray family. We will miss this extraordinary Iowan. Our State benefited in countless ways because he shared his gift so generously to make Iowa an even better place to grow for generations to come.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that three eulogies that highlight Governor Ray's life as a Governor, political humanitarian, and a man with strong family values be printed in the Record.  These eulogies are from David Oman, who served as chief of staff to Governor Ray; Ken Quinn, a former U.S. Ambassador to Cambodia who worked on the refugee resettlement as a member of the Ray administration and today serves as president of the World Food Prize Foundation in Des Moines; and the third is from Scott Raecker, who serves as director of the Robert D. and Billie Ray Center at Drake University. I hope my colleagues will read these eulogies because there is no way that anything I say today can do justice to what they said in their separate eulogies.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                          Robert D. Ray Eulogy                               David Oman        One more time, for the last time, Bob Ray has done what he      did so often in life--bring people together, in this church,      at the Capitol last evening, on social media, and in      conversations.        Lessons from his life have been learned and re-learned      this week, none better than the simple reminder that a keen      mind, warm heart, and a bias for action--by one person--can      cause great change, and uncork goodwill among so many.        Gov. Ray's life ended without regrets and remorse.      Embracing his example, we're better able to live our lives      with renewal and resolve.        Yesterday, a motorcade brought the Ray family past many      touchpoints in Bob's and Billie's lives--Terrace Hill, Drake      University, and Theodore Roosevelt High School.        President Roosevelt, in 1910, a year after leaving the      White House, spoke in Paris about leadership, and making a      difference.        He said, `above all stands character, a man's force and      courage, his good faith and sense of honor . . . self-     restraint, common sense, the power of individual      responsibility, and acting in conjunction with others.'        TR didn't know it, but he previewed the life of Robert D.      Ray, or as we called him, RDR.        Another President Roosevelt, Franklin, died at the end of      World War II. FDR and RDR had something in common--a very      real human touch. During FDR's funeral, an aging African      American man wept inconsolably on a Pennsylvania Ave.      sidewalk.        A reporter approached timidly and asked, `Did you know the      President?' The man said, `No . . . but he knew me.'        Good leaders, good people, know, in a broad sense--and in      the moment--what other people feel and need.        Bob Ray had that quality. He knew Iowans, or as he liked      to say `our Iowans.'        People who had a two-minute phone call or 20 minute      meeting, or just a handshake at the Fair, felt they mattered      and were the most important person to Gov. Ray at the time .      . . and they were.        Sometimes, Bob Ray wasn't aware of his impact.        Two years ago, at Wesley Acres, Gov. Ray wasn't in room      146, nor physical therapy or the lunch room. A nurse and I      couldn't find him. It turned out he was in P.T.; he told us      we'd been lost.        Then the nurse said to me `Gov. Ray changed my life . . .'      I asked her to tell me more.        It seems her late teen life was not good in 1969; she      doubted herself. Then she listened to Gov. Ray's first      Inaugural Address on the radio. She added, `He talked about      the future. He said the future was going to better and      brighter. I felt he was talking about me and my life. He gave      me hope. My life turned out alright, and now, I get to help      him.'        Gov. Ray spoke with thousands of Iowans through four of      his campaigns in seven years, ending the two-year term era.      Iowans quickly got to know his openness and decency . . .      civility and sincerity . . . humanity and humor.        And who didn't love his smile?        That genuine persona stood in stark contrast to the      erosion of trust in a Washington awash in Watergate. In '74,      Bob Ray stood against the tide. He won 59% of the vote when      nine other GOP governors were swept away. He acquired more      momentum, if not a mandate.        Governor Ray knew how to campaign. He knew how to govern.      And, he knew the difference.        The late Lt. Gov. Arthur Neu said, `Ray would take his      time making decisions, but when his mind was made up, he was      a tough as nails.'        The other evening, I wrote down Ray policy initiatives and      stopped at 30. Some were ahead of their time, some were      copied by other states. They covered tax policy, streamlined      government, education, conservation, human services, human      rights, public safety, agriculture and transportation.       I can't list them all today. As they say about baseball      stats . . . `you can look `em up.'        The Gov. would at times borrow or co-opt good ideas from      Democrats. They didn't know whether to laugh or cry, but he      always gave them credit.        Gov. Ray looked beyond the next year or cycle. He paired      with Gov. Culver's father, Sen. Culver, to set up the Iowa      2000 project. In his first term, Gov. Vilsack cloned it with      Iowa 2010.       In 1978, Gov. Ray came up with a new theme `progress with      stability' as part of a larger effort throughout his      administration to better connect Iowa's cities and towns with      rural Iowa.       In small towns he would nudge with nuance `stability with      progress.' Bob Ray communicated deftly. He was transparent      with and respected the press. He helped define modern Iowa      and did define the modern Iowa governorship.        With Billie Ray and three active daughters, the five      defined the modern Iowa First Family.        We thank you for supporting him, and for your sacrifice.        A governor's work is never easy. Gov. Ray's four      successors, all with us today, have said privately and      publicly, over time and this week, how much they respected      him and his leadership.        Bill Clinton was the 32 year-old Gov.-elect of Arkansas      when he met Bob Ray, then 50, at the NGA `new governors      school' in November '78.        The two hit it off. It was Ray `charisma' and Clinton      `charisma on steroids.'        Clinton credited Ray with mentoring him on how to be a      good governor. When he would come to Des Moines as President      in the 90s; he would often ask about Bob Ray and word would      get back to us. Wednesday, President Clinton tweeted a      heartfelt remembrance of his mentor and friend.        Ray met one Pope . . . but worked with seven Presidents.      There is apparently no public record of what Richard Nixon      thought of him. The tape recorders must have been turned off.        President Ford said, `I relied heavily on Bob's good      advice.'        President Reagan: `The success you experienced was the      product of good ideas, hard work, a whole lot of follow      through--just what you'd expect to find in Iowa.'        President George H. W. Bush said this well, `He never      turned his back on the Party, but somehow transcended Party      and made public service better.'        Like Bush 41 and Jimmy Carter with their post-     Presidencies, Bob Ray also defined the role of `former'      governor.        His ongoing service as CEO, mayor, and Drake president was      exemplary. Ray backed countless charities and good works.      Once I told him `you've supported about everything except      `Iowans for Term Limits.'        To close, in the years ahead, governors and perhaps      Presidents like Ronald Reagan was, will be in Room 9 of the      Capitol. Gov. Branstad fittingly designated it the `Robert D.      Ray Conference Room.'        Governors have made many important decisions in that room,      including Ray's to re-locate and welcome legal political      refugees to Iowa.        Future governors will see a large, wonderful oil painting      of Gov. Ray. That portrait is behind me. It returns to the      Governor's Office today.        Next year, or 2028, or 2046 (Iowa's Bicentennial year) or      any year, governors will sit in the Ray Conference Room--     coping with complicated, controversial, even morality laden      decisions.        Our Iowans and future Iowans can hope those governors      pause, in deliberative, decisive moments, look up at the      portrait, and think . . .        What would Robert D. Ray do?        How would he lead?                                  ____                   Eulogy for Governor Robert D. Ray                      Ambassador Kenneth M. Quinn        One of the first refugees Governor Ray rescued and      resettled in Iowa was a young man who was trapped in one of      the most treacherous and threatening environments on earth--     Washington, D.C. That person he rescued was me.        He brought me and my wife Le Son and our children home to      Iowa where we became part of Governor Ray's extended family.      For 4 years, I worked closely with the Governor on many of      his humanitarian endeavors.        A few weeks ago, I was with Governor and Mrs. Ray      recalling many of these experiences--and a flood of memories      came back about when we were together, including:        --In the winter of 1975, at the celebration for the Tai      Dam refugees from Laos, whom he had rescued and resettled      together in Iowa in order to preserve their culture, language      and kinship. The Tai Dam had written to every Governor in      America, but Robert Ray was the only Governor to answer their      plea. He convinced President Ford to permit all of the Tai      Dam to come to Iowa. They have been here ever since.        --Or, on a cold January night in 1979, while he and I      watched the video of a boat filled with Vietnamese ``boat      people'' refugees, who had escaped from Communist oppression      only to be pushed back out to sea by local officials fearful      of being inundated because no country in the world, including      the United States, was accepting any more refugees from      Indochina. We watched in horror as their boat broke up in the      waves, with the refugees drowning before our eyes.        This so impacted Governor Ray that he wrote late that very      night to the President, saying that Iowa would double the      number of refugees it had resettled if only the President      would reopen America's doors.        His letter and lobbying in Washington worked! America's      doors were reopened.        --Six months later, in June 1979 we were together in      Geneva, Switzerland, at the UN conference on the Boat People,      where Vice President Walter Mondale announced that America      would accept 168,000 new refugees each year. This led to over      1,000,000 refugees from Indochina eventually being resettled      in the United States.        The assembled diplomatic delegations gave a spontaneous      standing ovation to America's humanitarian leadership, a      leadership that began when Robert D. Ray became the first      governing official anywhere in the world to say he would      accept the Boat People refugees.        --A few months later in October 1979, I was with Governor      Ray at Living History Farm in Des Moines, as Pope John Paul      II appeared before 350,000 people. Among those bringing the      gifts to the Pope to celebrate Mass were Vietnamese Catholic      refugees in their colorful native dress.        --Two weeks later the Governor and Mrs. Ray and I were at      a place called Sa Kaew in Thailand where 30,000 victims of      the Cambodian genocide were lying strewn across a field.      Emaciated, starving and beset with disease, they were dying      at the rate of 50-100 a day, with their bodies being      bulldozed into mass graves.        --This scene of incredible human suffering led Governor      Ray to create Iowa SHARES. Iowa Sends Help to Aid Refugees      and End Starvation. With contributions by Iowans across the      state, we rushed food and medicine that arrived on Christmas      Day, to feed people who had been eating insects to survive.      This was followed by volunteer Iowa doctors and nurses.      Together this saved thousands of lives.        --On that same trip, we were in Nong Khai in Thailand,      where the Tai Dam, Lao and Hmong refugees were waiting      uncertain about their fate. These refugees said they wanted      to show us their ``symbol of hope.'' They took us across a      muddy field to a thatched hut. Beckoning us to look inside,      they said ``there is our symbol.'' Tacked on the wall was the      Iowa Department of Transportation highway map. Governor      Robert Ray had made the shape of our state a symbol of hope      for people languishing in a refugee camp 12,000 miles from      Iowa.        --There was one other event where neither the Governor nor      I were present but which has great meaning for today. In      2004, the Catholic Bishop of Des Moines visited a very ill      Pope John Paul II. When the Bishop reminded the Pontiff of      his visit to Living History Farms, the Pope heard ``Iowa''--     in a halting voice the frail Pope said--``Iowa . . . Farms .      . . Refugees.'' The man who put the words Iowa and Refugees      on the lips of a dying Pope, and who made the shape of Iowa a      symbol of hope around the world, was Governor Robert D. Ray.        The common thread in all of these experiences was that      Governor Ray was driven by moral impulses planted deep inside      him by his parents, the educational institutions he attended,      and his religion, and nurtured by his wife Billie and his      children.        When confronted by scenes of human suffering, Robert Ray      responded, not as a political candidate doing an electoral      calculation, but as a Christian following a moral imperative      from the parable of the Good Samaritan.        --Robert D. Ray saw that his obligation was to his fellow      human beings who were suffering and dying, even if the color      of their skin, the language they spoke, and the religion they      followed were all different from his own;        --Or, even if they were thousands and thousands of miles      away on the other side of our planet, or adrift in the ocean.        Through his actions, Governor Robert Ray answered the      eternal question--``Am I my brother's keeper?''        Even though the impact of Robert Ray's leadership would      often occur far from Iowa; The one story that most poignantly      captures Robert Ray's humanitarian legacy and his place in      the pantheon of Iowa's greatest heroes took place about 10      years ago, not in the Governor's office or far from Iowa, but      in a supermarket in West Des Moines.        As Governor Ray described it to me, he and Mrs. Ray were      shopping for groceries, pushing their cart down the aisle,      when, as can happen, they almost bumped into a cart being      pushed by another shopper--in this case, an Asian man.        When he saw it was Governor Ray, the man stopped; walked      over to the Governor and extending his hand, said ``you saved      my life. I just want to say thank you.''        Today thousands of Tai Dam, Lao, Hmong, Cambodians and      Vietnamese who live in Iowa just want to say thank you. In a      very real sense, Governor Robert Ray saved them all.        And all of us, whom he made so proud to say we are      Iowans--we just want to say thank you.        Governor Ray uplifted my life. He uplifted all of our      lives. And his legacy will uplift countless, thousands and      thousands of others far into the future.                                  ____                 Governor Robert D. Ray--Family Eulogy                            J.

You met through this church and church camp where      you were elected King and Queen. You became high school      sweethearts--you the smart looking girl with the car and      Governor Ray the shy school-boy athlete.       Together we've looked at the pictures of the two of you in      those early years--you and Governor Ray had a youthful      twinkle in your eyes and a shining smile that said--`I'm in      love'--and that's one thing that did not change over all      these years.       Recently you told me that in the last several months it was      just nice to sit and hold hands and tell each other `I love      you'--and as I observed these moments, I saw that same      twinkle and shining smile in both of you--and, oh my heavens,      it still radiated--`I'm so in love.'       You also shared that you never had a fight--and I believe      you. However, with all due respect, it has come to my      attention through an un-named grandchild that there were a      few disagreements--mostly over ice cream at McDonalds, and      they were resolved with another Diet Coke and a loving      grandpa slipping a dollar under the table to a very happy      granddaughter.       In your understated way you told me he was a `special      person'--which he was--and together you were spectacular . .      . you were always his beloved Billie Lee--and you most      certainly were his beloved soul mate.       Mrs. Ray, here is the message for the rest of us today--if      there is an aspect of Governor Ray's life that should inspire      us, and we should seek to emulate, it should be this--his      excellence as a man devoted to his family--and that passion      was rooted deeply in his faith, his love for you and his      desire to serve others in love.       It's no secret that Governor Ray's favorite titles in life      were husband, father and grandfather--and he took them      seriously--and with good humor.       It has been said that you can tell what kind of parent you      are by how your grandchildren turn out--and how your children      care for you as you age. And by all measures Mrs. Ray--you      and the Governor were an extreme success.       Randi, Lu Ann and Vicki, he loved you girls--     unconditionally. And, a gift he gave you . . . is that you      all know that fact.       Whether singing out to you as his `Miss America' or,      telling you at a time you needed to hear it the most, that      `you are always beautiful in my eyes'--he loved you in      actions that reflected his words.       And even when some boundaries needed to be set (you know      what I'm talking about), that was also done in love,      sometimes frustratingly so for you as he always wanted to      talk things out and think through the best resolutions and      consequences.       He was your hero, he was patient and calm, and even in the      darkest moments he looked for the positive. He was inclusive      as reflected best in his love for you son-in-laws.       And one of the things I have heard, and seen from you as      daughters, and the grandchildren as well, is this--his      admonition to ``Do more, speak less--and if you have to      speak, think before you speak.''       Now for you grandchildren, Robert, Jeffrey, Billie Ray,      John, Michael, Emma, Leah and Sadie--he absolutely adored and      cherished you--he was so proud of each of you. He talked more      about you than anything else. And, he loved taking pictures      of you.       I've watched you grow up directly, or through his stories,      and see so many traits of him in each of you. In fact, you      shared with me the traits you possess that you saw in your      grandpa. And here they are, listen closely . . .       Empathy, kindness, humor, humility, honesty, sense of      justice, respect, compassion, considerate, loyalty, self-     confident, attention to detail, positive, caring, adventurous      spirit, modest, selfless, charisma, perseverance,      appreciation for other cultures, a good and sometimes slow      decision-maker, a genuine and good hearted person, never mad,      peace-seeking and relationship centered.       And of course, love of ice cream and chocolate chip      cookies.       You also shared that one of the qualities you admired most      about him was that he was always `more interested in your      opinion than telling you his opinion.' A good lesson for all      of us.       And I loved this trait you shared--`he adored my grandma--     and so do I.'       Think of this list for a minute--these are the traits that      emanate from you--that is what a lasting legacy looks like.      And each of you grandchildren will continue to make your      lives, and the world, a better place because of these traits.       And, for the rest of us, these are qualities we also saw in      your grandpa that continue to shape our lives.       When you unpack the list and look deeply into the character      qualities you share with your grandpa--there is something      that resonates clearly--and for your grandpa it was developed      in this church early in his life.       They are called `fruits of the Spirit'--they are found in      Galatians 5 and they define your grandfather's life--they are      ``love, joy, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,      gentleness, and self-control.''       Of these fruits of Governor Ray's spirit, love was first      and foremost--and the fruits of his spirit were these words .      . . in action.       Mrs. Ray, Randi, Lu Ann, Vicki, grandchildren, and the      entire family--Governor Ray's family legacy lives on in you      and is a lesson for all of us.       His faith driven love served us all--and while most      directly to you the family--he     also served those of us who were blessed to call him a      friend.       Governor Ray loved quotes and we shared many over the      years. One that I gave him that he liked was from Richard      Bach who said:       ``The bond that links your true family is not one of blood,      but of respect and joy in each other's life. Rarely do      members of one family grow up under the same roof.''       I thought of this quote as I spoke with Tai Dam refugee and      family friend, Som Baccam, this week when she referred to      Governor Ray as her `savior'--and he literally was.       Savior is a strong and powerful word, and when I reflect on      times Governor Ray used that word in our discussions about      faith--he talked about how his Savior demonstrated      unconditional love--sacrificial love--service love--so that      we could love others and know our eternal home.       Governor Ray has left our earthly home and created a void      in our lives . . . and that hurts, however, I would challenge      us to think that the real void would be if we had never had      his presence in our lives.       Governor Ray set the standard for how to treat people . . .      and we can all be better people if we look to Governor Ray as      a model.       For me, and I hope for each of you, I want to be a better      person each day because of Governor Ray and his presence in      my life. I've felt that way since the day I met him . . . and      I will for the rest of my life.       The inspiration of Governor Ray's life is that we shine our      light in the lives of others when we demonstrate love--and we      must remember to shine that light first and foremost with our      family and friends.       I challenge us all to honor his legacy by aspiring to be      better people--by shining our light in our homes, with our      family--and with our friends.       Letting our light shine may be his most important lesson.       One more time--Governor Ray leading the way.                        Remembering Eugene Sukup
