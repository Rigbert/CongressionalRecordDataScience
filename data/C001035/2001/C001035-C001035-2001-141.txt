President, I commend the chairman of the committee for drafting this very important amendment to the bill.  I have been concerned that we could be imposing an expensive new mandate on State and local governments through the testing requirements of this bill. Testing is very important, but I think we need to provide support. The chairman's amendment will ensure that the funding is provided to help States and local school districts develop the very best possible tests in order to assess the performance of their students and that we will be providing a good chunk of the money to do so.  I commend the Senator for his amendment and for understanding that we need an assurance that that funding will be forthcoming before imposing this requirement.  Again, I thank the Senator from Vermont for coming forth with this important amendment.
