Chairman, I would like to include in the Record an exchange of letters between the Energy and Commerce Committee, and the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.         House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space,            and Technology,                               Washington, DC, September 10, 2012.     Hon. Fred Upton,     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Rayburn House          Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Upton: I am writing to you regarding H.R.      6213, the No More Solyndras Act. This legislation was      referred initially to both the Committee on Energy and      Commerce and the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.      H.R. 6213 was marked up by the Committee on Energy and      Commerce on July 31, 2012.       I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this      legislation before the House of Representatives in an      expeditious manner, and accordingly, I will waive further      consideration of this bill in Committee. This, of course,      being conditional on our mutual understanding that language      negotiated with the Science, Space, and Technology Committee      will be included in this or any similar legislation      considered on the House floor. However, agreeing to waive      consideration of this bill should not be construed as      waiving, reducing, or affecting the jurisdiction of the      Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.       Additionally, the Committee on Science, Space, and      Technology expressly reserves its authority to seek the      appointment of conferees during any House-Senate conference      that may be convened on this, or any similar legislation. I      ask for your commitment to support any request by the      Committee for conferees on H.R. 6213 as well as any similar      or related legislation.       I ask that a copy of this letter and your response be      included in the report on H.R. 6213 and also be placed in the      Congressional Record during consideration of the bill on the      House floor.       I look forward to working with you as we prepare to pass      this important legislation.           Sincerely,     Ralph M. Hall,       Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.       Enclosure.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                             Committee on Energy and Commerce,                               Washington, DC, September 10, 2012.     Hon. Ralph M. Hall,     Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,          Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Hall: Thank you for your letter regarding      H.R. 6213, the ``No More Solyndras Act.'' As you noted, there      are provisions of the bill that fall within the Rule X      jurisdiction of the Committee on Science, Space, and      Technology.       I appreciate your willingness to forgo action on H.R. 6213,      and I agree that your decision should not prejudice the      Committee on Science, Space, and Technology with respect to      the appointment of conferees or its jurisdictional      prerogatives on this or similar legislation, for which you      will have my support.       I will include a copy of your letter and this response in      the report on H.R. 6213 and the Congressional Record during      consideration of H.R. 6213 on the House floor.           Sincerely,                                                       Fred Upton,                                                         Chairman.  With that, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia, Dr. Gingrey.
