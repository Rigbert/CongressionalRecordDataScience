 For one thing, the bill before us does not change the Kemp-Kasten amendment. You can find it on page 763 of the bill. It is in the bill. In fact, let me read what it says:       Provided further, That none of the funds made available in      this Act nor any unobligated balances from prior      appropriations Acts may be made available to any organization      or program which, as determined by the     President of the United States, supports or participates in      the management of a program of coercive abortion or      involuntary sterilization.  So there is no need to pass the amendment of the Senator from Mississippi to put that language in--I suppose we could just print it twice--it is already in there.
