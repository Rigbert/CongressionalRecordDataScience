Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to pay tribute to my good friend, the late Philip Merrill, who passed away earlier this month. And I rise as well to celebrate the life of a colorful and accomplished man and to say to his grieving family, his wife Eleanor, known to all of us as Ellie, his son Doug, his daughters Cathy and Nancy, his sister Suzanne and his four grandchildren, and to his other loved ones as well as his countless friends, that he will never be forgotten by Marylanders and by all those whose lives he touched.  He was a man of immense and innumerable talents. Phil worked literally all over the world. He served as counselor to the Under Secretary of Defense as a member of the Defense Policy Board at the Defense Department from 1983 to 1990, as Assistant Secretary General to NATO from 1990 to 1992, and most recently, as president and chairman of the Export-Import Bank of the United States from 2002 until last year.  In all, Phil served in six administrations. That impressive resume alone would be enough for most people to hang their hat on. Yet for Phil Merrill it is only half of his story. It was in his beloved home State of Maryland, particularly in southern Maryland, where he left his greatest mark and improved and enriched the lives of all of us who live in the region. Indeed, he was a presence in the Washington metropolitan area and in Washington itself.  Mr. Speaker, I trust that you are familiar with the Washingtonian magazine, a publication owned by the Merrills. The Washingtonian was only a part of his vast publication business. Yet, I think that in this magazine we can truly see an imprint of Phil's spirit and the way that he approached life.  Washington is a diverse city, a place where many, maybe even most, of those who live here come from other parts of the country. And because of that, the Washington area is extraordinarily diverse in background and experience and taste and opinion and in world views. Yet, those of us who spend so much time in this city, Mr. Speaker, usually end up too often becoming too consumed by the work that we are doing and the issues that we care about to fully appreciate and to truly enjoy the unique culture that exists here.  That is where the Washingtonian magazine steps in. It was designed to encourage people to step back for just a moment and to take in the immense natural beauty and cultural offerings of this historic city. That is just what Phil Merrill did for the people around him. He inspired others to see that there actually is time in a busy life to do things like enjoy the outdoors. In his case, it was sailing and skiing and spending time with his beloved family that he so dearly loved for so long.  The other facet of Phil's publishing business was Capitol Gazette Communications, comprised of five local papers and the Capitol, Annapolis' hometown paper. As the New York Times recently reported, Mr. Merrill bought the paper as a moribund afternoon daily in 1968 and built its circulation from 13,000 to 47,000. It goes without saying, Mr. Speaker, that the Capitol and the other newspapers in the Capitol Gazette Communications chain are a vital part of the daily lives of many of us and of my own constituents. They help unite our community.                              {time}  1945  Finally, Mr. Speaker, let me say that Phil Merrill, publisher, successful businessman, diplomat, also will long be remembered as one of the most generous philanthropists of the Washington metropolitan area. During his life, Phil contributed tens of millions of dollars to his favorite causes, including the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, designed to restore and keep clean his beloved Chesapeake Bay, and the University of Maryland, for whom we shared a great love and commitment. He committed many dollars to the College of Journalism, one of the best now in the Nation. In addition, he contributed generously to the Johns Hopkins University's Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies.  Mr. Speaker, Phil Merrill was a giant. I attended his memorial service, and there were clearly well over 1,000 people in attendance. He was a man who thrived on living each hour of each day to the fullest. His pioneering spirit, his dedication to this country, and, above all, his unwavering love of family and loyalty to friends serve as a model for all of us to live by.  Phil Merrill will be missed, but he will not be forgotten.                          ____________________
