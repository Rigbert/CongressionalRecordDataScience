Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce a bill to amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 at the request of Cook Inlet Region, Inc. [CIRI].  Congress enacted the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [ANCSA] in 1971 to address claims to lands in Alaska by its Eskimo, Indian, and Aleut native people. Lands and other benefits transferred to Alaska Natives under the act were conveyed to corporations formed under the act. Alaska Natives enrolled to these corporations were issued shares in the corporation. CIRI is one of the corporations formed under ANCSA and has approximately 6,262 Alaska Natives enrolled, each of whom were issued 100 shares of stock in CIRI, as required under ANCSA.  ANCSA stock, unlike most corporate stock, cannot be sold, transferred, or pledged by the owners of the shares. Rather, transfers can only happen through inheritance, or in limited case, by court decree. The ANCSA provisions restricting the sale of stock were put in place to protect Native shareholders from knowledgeable or unscrupulous transactions, and to allow the corporation to grow and mature in order to provide long-lasting benefits to its shareholder.  The drafters of ANCSA initially believed that a period of 20 years would be a sufficient amount of time for the restrictions on sale to remain in place. Therefore, the restrictions were to expire 20 years after passage of ANCSA on December 31, 1991.  As 1991 approached, bringing with it the impending change in the alienability of Native stock, the Alaska Native community grew concerned about the effect of the potential sale of Native stock. The Alaska Federation of Natives, a statewide organization representing the State's 90,000 natives, spearheaded a legislative initiative to address the 1991 stock sale issue. Many of the Native corporations, including CIRI, actively solicited their shareholders' view on this critical matter, through meetings, questionnaires, polling, and formal votes. In 1987, 3 years prior to the 1991 restriction-lifting date, Congress enacted legislation which reformed the mechanism governing stock sale restrictions in a fundamental way under the 1987 amendments, instead of expiring automatically in 1991, the restrictions on alienability continue automatically unless and until the shareholders of a Native corporation [[Page E3]] vote to remove them. The 1987 amendments provide several procedural mechanisms to bring such a vote, including action by the board of directors and petitions by shareholder.  To date, no Native corporation has sought to life the alienability restrictions. Fundamentally, this is because Native shareholders continue to value Native ownership of the corporations and Native control of the lands and other assets held by them.  CIRI has conducted a number of continuing surveys, focus groups, and special shareholder meetings to ascertain the views of its shareholders regarding the alienation restrictions on CIRI stock. Two results have consistently stood out in these assessments.  First, the majority of CIRI shareholders favor maintaining Native ownership and control of CIRI. These shareholders, whose numbers consistently register at the 70 to 80 percent level, see economic benefits in the continuation of Native ownership, and also value the important cultural goals, values and activities of their ANCSA corporation.  Second, a significant percentage, albeit a minority of shareholders, favor assessing some, or all, of the value of their CIRI stock through the sale of that stock. These shareholders include, but, are not limited to elderly shareholders who have real current needs, yet doubt that sale of stock will be available to them in their lifetime: holders of small, fractional shares received through one or more cycles of inheritance; non-Natives who have acquired stock through inheritance but without attendant voting privileges; and shareholders who have few ties to the corporation or to Alaska, 25 percent of CIRI shareholders live outside of Alaska.  Under current law, these two legitimate but conflicting concerns cannot be addressed, because lifting restrictions on the sale of stock is an all or nothing proposition. In order to allow the minority of shareholders to exercise their desire to sell some or all of their stock, the majority of shareholders would have to sacrifice their important desire to maintain Native control and ownership to CIRI.  CIRI believes this conflict will eventually leave the interests of the majority of its shareholders vulnerable to political instability. In addition, CIRI recognizes that responding to the desire of those shareholders who wish to sell CIRI stock is a legitimate corporate responsibility. More importantly, CIRI believes that there is a way to address the needs and desires of both groups of shareholders, those who wish to sell stock and those who desire to maintain Native ownership of CIRI, so that the sale of stock will not compromise the ``nativeness'' of the company, and will not jeopardize the economic future of the company for those who choose not to sell. The method embodied in this legislation is one that other companies routinely use: the buying back of its own stock. The newly acquired stock would then be canceled.  Mr. Speaker, I have discussed this bill at length with CIRI and I am convinced this is the best and only option available for their shareholders to voluntarily sell their stock back to CIRI. It is identical to that which passed the House last session and I hope it will move as expeditiously as possible.                          ____________________
