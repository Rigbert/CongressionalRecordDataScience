 President, I rise today to congratulate Steve Sinton of Shandon, CA, on winning the American Farmland Trust's 2005 Steward of the Land Award. This award recognizes Steve for his lifelong commitment to conservation and sound stewardship practices. He is the ninth American farmer to win this award, and I am pleased to praise his efforts and achievements today.  Created in 1997 in honor of farmer and conservationist Peggy McGrath Rockefeller, the American Farmland Trust gives the Steward of the Land Award each year to a farmer or farm family in the United States who has shown outstanding leadership at the national, State, and local levels in protecting farmland and caring for the environment. This award recognizes ranchers such as Steve and helps raise awareness about the public benefits of good stewardship and the importance of conserving land for future generations.  Through his work on his own land and throughout the State of California, Steve Sinton has epitomized the spirit of this award through his dedication to protecting our country's farmlands and ranchlands, understanding how critical they are to supporting our local communities, sustaining our Nation's food supply, and preserving clean water and wildlife habitat.  A fourth generation California rancher, Steve and his wife Jane manage 18,000 acres of ranchland and 125 acres of vineyards where they utilize a variety of innovative practices to promote sustainability and protect the environment. He effectively works with local governments to protect ranch and farmlands, and Steve and his family have also played an important role in providing habitat for the reintroduction of the California condor on their land, including essential nesting grounds.  But Steve's efforts go far beyond his own family's farm. Steve helped form the California Rangeland Trust in 1998 where he was elected to serve as the founding chairman. With his leadership, the Rangeland Trust has protected over 170,000 acres of ranchland. Steve has also served as vice-chairman of the California Cattlemen's Association Land Use Committee, where his dedication and leadership galvanized support among the ranching community for agricultural conservation and conservation practices.  A look at Steve's family history makes clear why he works so hard for farmland preservation and takes these efforts so seriously. Steve's family came to San Luis Obispo County in 1874 and bought the family farm the following year, meaning that Steve's family has been ranching in the county for 130 years. Steve grew up on the family ranch and attended my alma mater, Stanford University, before heading to the University of Colorado School of Law. After five years with the California Department of Water Resources in Sacramento, CA, Steve returned to San Luis Obispo County to help manage the family's ranches and continue his private water law practice. In addition to all this, Steve also has been active in his community, working with numerous organizations, coaching sports, and serving on the Shandon School Board for fifteen years.  As a U.S. Senator representing the State of California, I congratulate Steve on winning this award and thank him for his many years of service to our State. I wish to send my very best to Steve, his wife Jane, and their two children Julie and Daniel.                          ____________________
