Speaker, these CRs carry forward the spending in 2018, the CRs the gentleman voted against. They have $1.6 billion in them. He voted ``no.''  And would the gentleman tell me why he didn't bring a bill to the floor for 11 months and 20 days that would have done what he says is such important work to be done? Can he tell me why he waited 11 months and 20 days to bring a bill to the floor?
