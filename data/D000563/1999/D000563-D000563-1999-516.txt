Is it not true that at 5:45--in 45 minutes--there will be a motion by the Republicans to table the Democratic version of the Patients' Bill of Rights without further debate, without further amendment, and to bring to an end this debate about whether families across America will have the stronger voice in terms of their health insurance protection?  I ask the Senator from Massachusetts, who has been here for a few months, to respond, if he will. Why is it that the Republican majority is so concerned about or afraid of the idea of actually debating or deliberating something which is so important to American families, their health care?
