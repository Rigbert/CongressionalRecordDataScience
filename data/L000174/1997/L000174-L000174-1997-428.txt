President, the Senator from West Virginia has stood stalwartly like the giant rock maple trees of Vermont, those trees, which have such great strength but are also the source of Vermont's sweetest product, maple syrup. I say this because we know of the kindness and gentleness toward his colleagues of the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, but we know that like the rock maple trees of Vermont, he does not bend to the attacks on the Constitution.
