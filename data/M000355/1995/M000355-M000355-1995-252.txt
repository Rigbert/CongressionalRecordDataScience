 President, I just want to make clear that any Member of the Senate who chose to take multiple gifts under $50, the hypothetical that my friends from Wisconsin and Minnesota could very legitimately claim is possible under a plain reading of the Lott amendment, would necessarily be in serious trouble before the Ethics Committee.  There is no question that under section 2(A)(1) of the rules of the Select Committee on Ethics that that would be considered improper conduct. Under the Senate Code of Conduct, subsection (A), I think it would clearly constitute misconduct.  I just want to assure my friend, reasonable people can differ about the propriety of this amendment, but I did not want it left unrebutted that one could engage in the kind of conduct that a plain reading of the Lott amendment might seem to permit when, in fact, it would be a clear violation of the kind of standards that we all know apply in the Senate.  I strongly recommend, as chairman of the committee, that whether the limit is put at $20 or whether it is put at $50, below which there is no aggregation, anybody who engages in that kind of blatant effort to circumvent the rule is going to have a very, very serious case before the Ethics Committee.  I suggest they get themselves a good lawyer because the chances are they are likely to get censured.  I thank the Chair very much. I thank my friend from Minnesota. I think it is important that we clear this up, that one could engage in this kind of conduct with impunity and expect not to be in deep, deep trouble.
