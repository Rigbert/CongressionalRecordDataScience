 President, I joined 56 of my Senate colleagues and over 200 in the House of Representatives in writing the President asking that he work with the Congress toward a policy that will enable important medical research to proceed utilizing stem cells from frozen embryos that were created to treat infertility problems and which are now slated to be discarded. Continued studies using stem cell technology offer hope for a better future for millions of people afflicted with a wide range of illnesses and conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, cancer and others.  Presently there are estimated to be more than 400,000 in vitro fertilized embryos that were developed to enable couples to have children, but that are now not needed for that purpose. These frozen embryos are likely to be destroyed. The President could hasten the progress of this important research by modifying his present policy to permit these embryos to be donated, with the consent of the couple, for stem cell research. I look forward to working with the President toward this goal.                          ____________________
