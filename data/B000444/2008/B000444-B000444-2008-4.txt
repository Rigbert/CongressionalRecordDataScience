 President, today I am submitting a resolution designating October 17, 2008, as ``National Mammography Day.'' This is the 16th straight year I have introduced such legislation, and I am proud to say that on each occasion the Senate has shown its support for the fight against breast cancer by approving the resolution.  Each year, as I prepare to introduce this resolution, I review the latest information from the American Cancer Society about breast cancer. For 2008, it is estimated that nearly 182,460 women will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and 40,480 women will die of this disease.  The first several times I introduced this resolution, I commented on how gloomy the statistics surrounding breast cancer were. While we still must address the unfortunate trend of a higher mortality rate in African American women when compared to that of White women and women from other minority groups, there are some numbers that give us hope in our struggle to defeat this disease. As I mentioned last year, the trend over time is that the number of deaths from breast cancer is fairly stable and falling from year to year. According to the American Cancer Society, the death rate from breast cancer in women has decreased since 1990: between 1975-1990, the death rate increased by 0.4 percent; between 1990-2004, the death rate decreased by 2.2 percent annually.  This decline in the breast cancer mortality rate has been attributed to improvements in breast cancer treatment, as well as early detection from mammograms and other screening methods. New digital techniques make the process of mammography more rapid and precise than before. In addition, early detection of breast cancercontinues to result in extremely favorable outcomes: 98 percent of women with localized breast cancer and 84 percent of those with regional disease will survive 5 years or longer. Government programs will provide free mammograms to those who can't afford them, as well as Medicaid eligibility for treatment if breast cancer is diagnosed. Information about treatment of breast cancer with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy has exploded, reflecting enormous research developments with regards to this disease. Thanks to the advances in research, screening, and treatment, a diagnosis of breast cancer is not a death sentence, all of us encounter long-term survivors of this disease almost daily, whether we realize it or not.  Recently, there has been discussion among scientists regarding the best and most appropriate screening tool for breast cancer, traditional mammography or more advanced technology like magnetic resonance imaging, MRI. In addition, newspapers have been filled with discussions over whether the scientific evidence actually supports the conclusion that periodic screening mammography saves lives. For those of us who are neither physicians nor scientists in this highly technical area, we look to the experts. The American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force all continue to recommend periodic screening mammography. However, it is also of note, that in 2007, an expert panel convened by the American Cancer Society released new recommendations for the use of MRIs for women at increased risk. The Society recommended annual screening, including an MRI in addition to mammography for high risk women, lifetime risk of greater than 20 percent, of developing the disease. Women with moderately increased risk of developing the disease, lifetime risk of 15 to 20 percent, should discuss with their physician the option of an MRI in addition to their annual mammogram. Women that do not fall into the high or moderate risk categories have no need to supplement their mammogram with an MRI.  I know that some women don't get annual mammograms due to fear or forgetfulness. It is only human nature for some to avoid mammograms because they are afraid of what the tests will reveal. To those who are fearful, I would say that if you get periodic routine mammograms, and the latest one indicates a possible cancer, even before any symptoms or before detection of a lump through a self-exam, you have great reason to be optimistic. Such early detected breast cancers are highly treatable.  Then there is forgetfulness. I understand how difficult it is to remember to schedule an annual appointment. This is where National Mammography Day comes in. On that day, let's make sure that each woman we know picks a specific date on which to get a mammogram each year, a date that she won't forget: a child's birthday, an anniversary, perhaps even the day her taxes are due. On National Mammography Day, let's ask our loved ones: pick one of these dates, fix it in your mind along with a picture of your child, your wedding, or another symbol of that date, and promise yourself to get a mammogram on that day. Once you pick a date, call your health care provider and make the appointment. If you have access to the internet, go to the American Cancer Society's website and sign up for the mammogram reminder service they'll send you an e-mail to remind you about the date you picked. Do it for yourself and your loved ones who want you to be part of their lives for as long as possible.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in the ongoing fight against breast cancer by supporting this resolution to designate October 17, 2008, as ``National Mammography Day.''                          ____________________
