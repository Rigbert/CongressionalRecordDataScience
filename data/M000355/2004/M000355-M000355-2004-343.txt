 President, I am concerned by reports from Mongolia of alleged election irregularities following a July 17th revote at a certain polling station in the capital city of Ulaan Baatar.  According to observers on the ground, the revote occurred less than 12 hours after it was announced at 8 p.m. on July 16th. While I do not know the nocturnal habits of the Mongolian people, I doubt that voters in Ulaan Baatar--or anywhere else in Mongolia, for that matter--can be fully and adequately informed of the revote in such a short time.  Field reports seem to bear this out. According to the International Republican Institute, turnout at that polling station in the June 27th elections exceeded 70 percent; on the July 17th revote, it totaled some 46 percent. Nearly one-quarter of those who voted in June did not cast a ballot in July.  Further troubling are allegations of a systematic pattern of denying supporters of the Motherland Democracy Coalition, MDC, the right to vote, refusal to permit MDC observers inside the polling station, the use of Mongolian law enforcement officials to prohibit access to the polling station, and vote buying in favor of the ruling Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, MPRP.  If proven true, these irregularities would mark a major departure from Mongolia's previous election experiences, where voting was generally orderly and according to applicable laws and regulations.  My colleagues might find it interesting that the seat in question was won in the first round of balloting by MDC candidate and businessman Otganbayer by a 222 vote margin. The revote found MPRP Defense Minister Gurragchaa winning the seat by 1,239 votes.  There is no question that reports of irregularities and chicanery must be fully and impartially investigated by the relevant election authorities, and that any and all violators of election laws and regulations be prosecuted and punished to the fullest extent of Mongolian law. It is my hope that this process is more transparent than the counting of ballots at that particular polling station. It is outrageous that MPRP officials prohibited independent election observers to witness the opening of ballot boxes and the counting of ballots--in violation, I understand, of Mongolian law.  Mongolia's leadership would be wise to consider that the country's reputation--and inclusion as an eligible recipient for increased foreign assistance under the Millennium Challenge Corporation--is at stake. Any government that is formed that does not reflect the real will of the Mongolian people will lack credibility and the respect of the international community.  Ulaan Baatar should take note that Washington--and the world--is watching.                          ____________________
