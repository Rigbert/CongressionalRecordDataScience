In fact, as the gentleman probably knows, hopefully, the polling data indicates that the support for the public option has risen since August--has risen, I tell my friend. And there are a number of different ways to get there.  The Senate has one that's on public display, has been on the Internet. The House Education and Labor Committee has one option with Ways and Means that has been on the Internet. It's been on the Internet since July. Energy and Commerce has one--a different correlation of that--and it's been on the Internet since July. There have been a lot of discussions, and I would refer my friend to the Internet, and I am sure he has copies of all of those bills.  Nothing is secret, nothing is behind closed doors.  Now, are we having discussions with ourselves about how we want to get there and with people who will vote for the bill?  The gentleman has made it very clear, I don't think your side is for a public option. We disagree on that. That is a fair disagreement. You're not for a public option, and I haven't talked to anybody on your side that's for a public option.  We disagree. We believe that the public option is an option that the public ought to have and not simply be in the sights of insurance companies who may or may not give them the price or the coverage that they could either afford or need. That's the difference. But I haven't talked to anybody on your side who wants a public option no matter how it is configured.  So very frankly, I will tell my friend that discussions with your side on a public option seem somewhat pointless.
