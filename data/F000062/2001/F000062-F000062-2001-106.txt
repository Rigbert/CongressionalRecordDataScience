 President, I rise, along with Senator Thompson, to introduce legislation to restore pay equity for our Federal judges. This legislation would guarantee judges automatic and annual cost-of-living adjustments, COLAs, just like other rank-and-file Federal employees.  In addition, the legislation would end a decade of Federal judicial salary neglect by giving judges a one-time salary increase of 9.6 percent. In the past decade, Congress has denied COLAs for judges in four separate years, in 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1998. This bill would restore to Federal justices the four COLAs they have lost.  In his year-end report on the state of the Federal Judiciary, Chief Justice William Rehnquist called the ``the need to increase judicial salaries'' the most pressing issue facing the Federal judiciary.  Simply put, while government service offers its own rewards, we should not create financial disincentives to service on the Federal bench.  Federal judges bear enormous responsibility as they preside over the most pressing legal issues. Often, they must render life-or-death decisions or preside over cases with millions of dollars at stake. For this vitally important work, they deserve appropriate compensation.  Recently, Congress took some action to restore equity in Federal salaries by doubling the salary of the President of the United States from $200,000 to $400,000.  Congress should now consider an appropriate pay adjustment for the Federal judiciary. As of January 2001, Federal district judges receive an annual salary of $145,000. If judges had received the COLAs to which they were entitled, a Federal District judge's salary would actually be $164,700, nearly $20,000 higher.  Now, $145,000 is a lot more money than the salary of a typical worker but it is not so high when you compare it to equivalent positions of authority in the private sector. For example, the average partner in a major national law firm earns well over $500,000 per year.  It is even more striking to note that major national law firms are offering first-year associates salaries topping $125,000 a year. With bonuses, some of these newly minted lawyers are earning more than appellate judges.  The bottom line is that we cannot expect to keep our country's best lawyers interested in serving on the Federal bench if we continue to denigrate the salary of the post. Just since 1993, the salary of Federal judges, adjusted for inflation, has declined by 13 percent.  Not surprisingly, more and more judges are leaving the Federal bench. Between 1991 and 2000, 52 Federal judges resigned their seats, many of them for the purposes of returning to private practice. These 52 judges represent 40 percent of the 125 Federal judges who have left the bench since 1965.  Attorneys should not expect to become wealthy through an appointment as a Federal judge. Neither should judges expect to have their salaries eroded by Congress' failure to give them Cost-of-Living Adjustments.  Preserving judicial salaries is vital to maintaining the high quality of our Federal judiciary. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to restore fairness to judicial compensation.                                 ______                                       By
