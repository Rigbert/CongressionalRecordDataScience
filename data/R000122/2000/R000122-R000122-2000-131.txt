President, I rise today to introduce legislation with my distinguished colleague, Senator Bingaman, that we hope will mark the beginning of a dialogue on an issue that has tremendous implications for our nation's public health, and more specifically, the health and well-being of our children. Today, we are introducing the ``Tobacco Regulatory Fairness Act of 2000''.  The goal of this legislation is quite simple--to grant the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the authority it needs to regulate the manufacture, labeling, advertising, distribution and sale of tobacco products.  A week ago, the Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 that the FDA does not have the authority to regulate tobacco products, thus nullifying regulations promulgated by the agency in August 1996. While a slim majority of the court found that the agency lacked the jurisdiction necessary to act on this class of products, the Justices in the majority and minority both opinions acknowledged the clear threat unregulated tobacco products poses to public health. In the majority opinion, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor stated that tobacco was ``perhaps the single most significant threat to public health in the United States.'' Similarly, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, a former professor of mine at Harvard University School of Law, pointed out in the dissenting opinion that FDA's ability to regulate tobacco products clearly fit into its basic authority, ``the overall protection of the public health.''  Although the court upheld the 1998 ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the decision does not dispute, and, in fact, it reaffirms that the FDA is the most appropriate agency to regulate tobacco products, given the general scope of its authority and its emphasis on protecting the public health. Now, it is a matter of Congress taking action to clearly give the FDA the long overdue authority it requires.  So today, I introduce this legislation as a challenge to my colleagues to do what is right--to debate and pass legislation that will once and for all give FDA the tools it needs to enact regulations that will help to protect children and others from the dangers of tobacco.  After the long and protracted debate in the Senate two years ago on the McCain tobacco bill, I am sure that most of my colleagues are familiar with the numerous statistics that are often cited in relation to the dangers of smoking and its devastating impact on society in terms of health care costs, lost productivity, disability, and loss of life. However, I believe these figures bear repeating. It is estimated that today, some 50 million Americans are addicted to tobacco, and one out of every three long-term users will die from a disease related to their tobacco use.  The cost of tobacco use not only results in lives lost, but also has a considerable toll on health care expenses. It is estimated that the health care costs associated with treating tobacco-related disease totals over $80 billion a year--with almost half being paid for by taxpayer financed health care programs.  We also know that tobacco addiction is clearly a problem that starts with children: almost 90 percent of adult smokers started using tobacco at or before age 18. Each year, one million children become regular smokers--and one-third of them will die prematurely of lung cancer, emphysema, and similar tobacco caused diseases. Unless current trends are reversed, five million kids under 18 alive today will die from tobacco related diseases.  In Rhode Island, while overall cigarette use is declining slightly, it has increased by more than 25 percent among high-schoolers. Currently, over one-third of New England high school students under age 18 use tobacco products. In Rhode Island, over one third of high school students smoke.  Indeed, tobacco use continues to permeate the ranks of the young. For decades, the tobacco industry has ingeniously promoted its products. It has done so with total disregard for the health of its customers. It has relied upon cool, youthful images to sell its products. The tobacco industry has taken an addiction that prematurely kills and dressed it up as a glamorous symbol of success and sex appeal.  By providing the FDA with the appropriate and unambiguous authority, we can be assured that these products comply with minimum health and safety standards. Tobacco should be regulated in the same way every other product we consume is regulated.  I will concede that there are some formidable challenges ahead--but these challenges are not insurmountable. During the 1998 debate on the McCain tobacco bill, a majority of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle agreed our country needed a national tobacco control policy. While we may not have succeeded then, we cannot and must not allow the progress the FDA has made in limiting minors' access to tobacco be lost.  We all know that tobacco is a substance that not only reduces the quality of one's life in the short term, but with lifelong use results in untimely death. We have an opportunity this year to make a real difference. Through the legislation I am introducing today, I call my colleagues to action in the ongoing fight to protect the long term health of the children of this country.  I urge my colleagues to join me in this commitment to enacting legislation granting FDA the authority to regulate tobacco products.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2333       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Tobacco Regulatory Fairness      Act of 2000''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Cigarette smoking and tobacco use cause approximately      450,000 deaths each year in the United States.       (2) Cigarette smoking accounts for approximately      $65,000,000,000 in lost productivity and health care costs.       (3) In spite of the well-established dangers of cigarette      smoking and tobacco use, there is no Federal agency that has      any authority to regulate the manufacture, sale,      distribution, and use of tobacco products.       (4) The tobacco industry spends approximately      $4,000,000,000 each year to promote tobacco products.       (5) Each day 3,000 children try cigarettes for the first      time, many of whom become lifelong addicted smokers.       (6) There is no minimum age requirement in Federal law that      an individual must reach to legally buy cigarettes and other      tobacco products.       (7) The Food and Drug Administration is the most qualified      Federal agency to regulate tobacco products.       (8) It is inconsistent for the Food and Drug Administration      to regulate the manufacture, sale, and distribution of other      nicotine-containing products used as substitutes for      cigarette smoking and tobacco use and not be able to regulate      tobacco products in a comparable manner.     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.       Section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21      U.S.C. 321) is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``(kk) The term `tobacco product' means cigarettes, cigars,      little cigars, pipe tobacco, smokeless tobacco, snuff, and      chewing tobacco.       ``(ll) The term `tobacco additive' means any substance the      intended use of which results or may reasonably be expected      to result, directly or indirectly, in its becoming a      component or otherwise affecting the characteristics of any      tobacco product.       ``(mm) The term `constituent' means any element of      cigarette mainstream or sidestream smoke which is present in      quantities which represent a potential health hazard or where      the health effect is unknown.       ``(nn) The term `tar' means mainstream total articulate      matter minus nicotine and water.''.     SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT.       Section 301 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21      U.S.C. 331) is amended--       (1) in subsections (a), (b), (c), (g), and (k), by striking      ``or cosmetic'' and inserting ``cosmetic, or tobacco      product''; and       (2) by adding at the end the following:       ``(u) The manufacture, sale, distribution, and advertising      of tobacco products in violation of regulations promulgated      by the Secretary pursuant to chapter X.''.     SEC. 5. REGULATION OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS.       The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et      seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:                     ``CHAPTER X--TOBACCO PRODUCTS     ``SEC. 1000.
