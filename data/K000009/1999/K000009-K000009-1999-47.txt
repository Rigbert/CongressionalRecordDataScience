Chairman, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Walsh) for his cooperation on this matter.  Mr. Chairman, in the bill, we have granted some additional funding to the National Credit Union Administration for its revolving loan fund for low income credit unions, and I thank the chairman for his leadership and consideration.  The purpose of the revolving loan fund is to make low interest loans to credit unions that serve primarily low income populations, and the earnings from the fund are used for technical assistance grants to low income credit unions so we really can help people become bankable.
