I do not disagree with the Senator from Georgia in his intent on helping families pay for education. That, too, is a concern of my colleague, Senator Schumer from New York, who supports the President's plan of deductibility of college expenses on your tax returns. I think that is an excellent way of increasing opportunity in education.  I do believe, if we are going to take our money and our surplus and invest it in education, we should look to those who, frankly, need the most help. I think it would be the working families. I am afraid the Senator's approach, according to the Treasury Department analysis, gives 70 percent of the benefits to families in the upper 20 percent of America. It tips the scales heavily to the wealthiest families. I agree with the Senator's comments, and I hope hisbill will reflect we should direct more help to working families struggling to put their kids through college. I am afraid, as I see it, his bill does not do that.
