 Madam Speaker, the national security letters were not one of the additional law enforcement powers that were passed as a part of the PATRIOT Act. They were passed in 1986, 15 years before 9/11 and the PATRIOT Act was passed.  The gentleman is correct in saying that national security letters were held unconstitutional, and what we did in this reauthorization bill is to provide a procedure to challenge them and make them constitutional, even though they weren't in the original PATRIOT Act.
