President, the risks and health effects of mercury contamination continue to be serious and immediate. We have known about mercury pollution for many years. It remains one of, if not the last of, themajor toxic pollutants without a comprehensive plan to control its spread. We know where the sources contributing to mercury contamination are, we have a pretty good idea where it goes, and we definitely know what harm it causes to people and to wildlife. Yet, serious contamination continues. That is why I am reintroducing important legislation today to confront this problem directly.  The most serious threat of mercury pollution is to our children. Just this week, the Environmental Protection Agency finally released their report, ``American's Children and the Environment: Measures of Contaminants, Body Burdens and Illnesses.'' The report should alarm all of us. It highlights the neurological harm that can come to children exposed to elevated mercury levels while in the womb and during the first years of their lives. As more mercury is dumped into our environment, more children will be at risk. Today, according to the Centers for Disease Control, 1 in 12 women of childbearing age has mercury levels above the safe health threshold established by EPA.  Although the report comes nine months late, it does highlight a serious gap between the Administration's ``Clear Skies'' proposal and the Leahy/Snowe bill when it comes to reducing mercury levels. The only thing clear about the Administration's proposal is that it won't protect Vermont's children from the pollution spewing out of power plants in the Midwest. The Administration's Clear Skies proposal will actually relax current mercury emissions law.  Our bill will reduce mercury emission from coal-fired power plants by 90 percent. The Clear Skies proposal would only reduce emissions by 50 percent in the near future and 70 percent over the next 15 years. Not only does this fall far short of our proposal, but it also falls short of current law and the Administration's previous position. In 2001, EPA Administrator Christie Todd Whitman said the EPA had initiated strict ``maximum achievable control technology'' MACT, standards for oil- and coal-fired electric utility units as required under section 112 of the Clean Air Act. At that time, Whitman said that mercury reductions are ``necessary now, not decades from now.''  Administrator Whitman was right then and wrong now. With industry's vigorous opposition to tighter mercury controls and the Bush administration's record to date rolling back environmental legislation regulation, especially the Clean Air Act, I worry that more children will be put at risk as the Administration continues to delay the MACT standards and other policies. The delays and rollbacks make you ask whose interests the Administration is putting first--children, or the big powerplant companies?  I ask for unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the summary of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:     Summary of the Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 2003   What will the Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 2003 do?       The Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 2003      mandates substantial reductions in mercury emissions from all      major sources in the United States. It is the only      comprehensive legislation to control mercury emissions from      all major sources. It directs EPA to issue new standards for      unregulated sources and to monitor and report on the progress      of currently regulated sources. It sets an aggressive      timetable for these reductions so that mercury emissions are      reduced as soon as possible.       With these emissions reductions, the bill requires the safe      disposal of mercury recovered from pollution control systems,      so that the hazards of mercury are not merely transferred      from one environmental medium to another. It requires annual      public reporting--in both paper and electronic form--of      facility-specific mercury emissions. It phases out mercury      use in consumer products, requires product labeling, and      mandates international cooperation. It supports research into      the retirement of excess mercury, the handling of mercury      waste, the effectiveness of fish consumption advisories, and      the magnitude of previously uninventoried sources. Section 3. Mercury emission standards for fossil fuel-fired electric                      utility steam generating units       The EPA's ``Mercury Study Report to Congress'' estimated 52      tons of mercury emissions per year from coal- and oil-fired      electric utility steam generating units. More recently, an      EPA inventory estimated 43 tons of mercury from coal-fired      power plants. Collectively, these power plants constitute the      largest source of mercury emissions in the United States. In      December 2000, the EPA issued a positive determination to      regulate these mercury emissions. But these rules will take      years to write and implement, and there is already vigorous      industry opposition. It is uncertain what form these rules      will take or how long they may be delayed. This section      requires EPA to set a ``maximum achievable control      technology'' (MACT) standard for these emissions, such that      nationwide emissions decrease by at least 90 percent.     Section 4. Mercury emission standards for coal- and oil-fired                  commercial and industrial boiler units       The EPA's report on its study estimates that 29 tons of      mercury emissions are released per year from coal- and oil-     fired commercial and industrial boiler units. The EPA has not      yet decided to regulate these emissions. This section      requires EPA to set a MACT standard for these mercury      emissions, such that nationwide emissions decrease by at      least 90 percent.section 5. reduction of mercury emissions from solid waste incineration                                  units       The EPA study estimates that 30 tons of mercury emissions      are released each year from municipal waste combustors. These      emissions result from the presence of mercury-containing      items such as fluorescent lamps, fever thermometers,      thermostats and switches, in municipal solid waste streams.      In 1995 EPA promulgated final rules for these emissions, and      these rules took effect in 2000. This section reaffirms those      rules and requires stricter rules for units that do not      comply. The most effective way to reduce mercury emissions      from incinerators is to reduce the volume of mercury-     containing items before they reach the incinerator. That is      why this section also requires the separation of mercury-     containing items from the waste stream, the labeling of      mercury-containing items to facilitate this separation, and      the phaseout of mercury in consumer products within three      years, allowing for the possibility of exceptions for      essential uses.     section 6. mercury emission standards for chlor-alkali plants       The EPA study estimates that 7 tons of mercury emissions      are released per year from chlor-alkali plants that use the      mercury cell process to produce chlorine. EPA has not issued      rules to regulate these emissions. This section requires each      chlor-alkali plant that uses the mercury cell process to      reduce its mercury emissions by 95 percent. The most      effective way to meet this standard would be to switch to the      more energy efficient membrane cell process, which many      plants already use.    section 7. mercury emission standards for portland cement plants       The EPA study estimates that 5 tons of mercury emissions      are released each year from Portland cement plants. In 1999      EPA promulgated final rules for emissions from cement plants,      but these rules did not include mercury. This section      requires each Portland cement plant to reduce its mercury      emissions by 95 percent. section 8. report on implementation of mercury emission standards for                        medical waste incinerators       The EPA study estimates that 16 tons of mercury emissions      are released per year from medical waste incinerators. In      1997 EPA issued final rules for emissions from hospital/     medical/infectious waste incinerators. This section requires      EPA to report on the success of these rules in reducing these      mercury emissions. section 9. report on implementation of mercury emission standards for                        hazardous waste combustors       The EPA study estimates that 7 tons of mercury emissions      are released each year form hazardous waste incinerators. In      1999 EPA promulgated final rules for these emissions. This      section requires EPA to report on the success of these rules      in reducing these mercury emissions.                     section 10. defense activities       This section requires the Department of Defense to report      on its use of mercury, including the steps it is taking to      reduce mercury emissions and to stabilize and recycle      discarded mercury. This section also prohibits the Department      of Defense from returning the nearly 5,000 tons of mercury in      the National Defense Stockpile to the global market.                  section 11. international activities       This section directs EPA to work with Canada and Mexico to      study mercury pollution in North America, including the      sources of mercury pollution, the pathways of the pollution,      and options for reducing the pollution.                      section 12. mercury research       This section supports a variety of mercury research      projects. First, it promotes accountability by mandating an      interagency report on the effectiveness of this act in      reducing mercury pollution. Second, it mandates an EPA study      on mercury sedimentation trends in major bodies of water.      Third, it directs EPA to evaluate and improve state-level      mercury data and fish consumption advisories. Fourth, it      mandates a National Academy of Sciences report on the      reatirement of excess mercury, such as     stockpiled industrial mercury that is no longer needed due to      plant closures or process changes. Fifth, it mandates an EPA      study of mercury emissions from electric arc furnaces, a      source not studied in the EPA's study report. Finally, it      authorizes $2,000,000 for modernization and expansion of the      Mercury Deposition Network, plus $10,000,000 over ten years      for operational support of that network.
