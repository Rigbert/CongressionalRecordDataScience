 President, I have had a number of things to say lately about leadership and moral posture. I have mentioned these issues several times on this floor in the past few days. I wish to draw the attention of my colleagues to an example of what a void in clear leadership and guidance means. It illustrates what we might call the trickle down defect.  When there is uncertain leadership, when leaders are unclear on their true intent, their irresoluteness trickles down. Nowhere is this effect easier to detect than in this administration's drug policy. From almost the first day of this administration there have been mixed signals and muddled directions about our drug policy. While the words have pointed in one direction, actions have gone off in every direction. The only thing that has been constant has been inconsistency.  One of the best examples of that was the President's move to fire most of the people in the drug czar's office just after his inauguration. That office was then not supported. The drug issue fell off the agenda. The President called ``time out'' in the war on drugs.  Lately, the administration is moving to restore personnel to the drug czar's office. I am sure there is no connection between that move and the fact that this is an election year. Miraculously and suddenly, the President has learned what the American people have known all along. One of the most important tools in fighting drug abuse among kids is to provide consistent leadership--to have a consistent message. At one time, we had that. The most remembered phrase from the years before Mr. Clinton was ``Just say no.'' Unfortunately, we lost that message.  The most remembered phrase of this administration is, ``I didn't inhale.''  Today, a mixed and muddled message has trickled down through the bureaucracy. We have seen a falling off in effort. We have seen confused priorities. We have seen a decline in interagency coordination. We have not seen much in the way of leadership. What we have seen is rising drug abuse.  And, this lack of consistency has consequences. The latest example comes from just the past few days. The Centers for Disease Control, a Federal agency based in Atlanta and paid for by the taxpayers, cosponsored a conference this past weekend. The conference was held under the innocent enough title of ``harm reduction.'' Unfortunately, that mild phrase conceals a bleak reality. Things are not always what they seem.  Many of the other cosponsors of the conference, such as the Drug Policy Foundation and the Lindesmith Center, are among the largest drug legalization lobbies in this country. The press release announcing the conference put out by the Drug Policy Foundation ends with a call, and I quote, ``End the Drug War''. The stated goal of these organizations is to get drugs legalized. The CDC, perhaps unknowingly, have associated themselves with this position. A position that is supposedly directly opposite of the administration's stated policy. What you have is a Government agency charged with dealing with controlling epidemics collaborating with those who want to legalize drugs, which would cause a major epidemic. This is a masquerade. But, it is clear that the CDC is confused about what our policyis. Confused about their role in supporting that policy. But it should not come as a surprise.  Mixed up and muddled. Confused signals and uncertain direction. Actions that belie statements. This has been the recent legacy. No wonder people are confused.  When these things happen, who is responsible? Who do we look to? You have to look to the people who set the course. Remember that the CDC comes under the Public Health Service, which works for the Surgeon General. And who was our last Surgeon General? Joycelyn Elders. Recall that she was the one who sounded the call for legalization in the first days of the Clinton administration. There was never any meaningful response. Certainly the decimated Drug Czar's office could mount no convincing reply. Unfortunately, Dr. Elders' remarks remain fixed in public memory. Everyone remembers her, who remembers anything said by the Drug Czar? Or the President?  We have seen lately a born-again drug policy from the administration, the message is still unclear. Evidently, the CDC is still confused. But their confusion is no orphan.  When the message broadcast from the top is contradictory. When it is hedged with qualifiers. When the guidance is unclear, it should come as no surprise to find bungling at the bottom.  Here we have the Centers for Disease Control, part of our national effort to fight the war on drugs, lending its name and prestige against the war of drugs. The right hand of this administration does not know what the left hand is up to. Lack of leadership trickles down. Is it any wonder that teenage drug use is on the rise? Is it any wonder that kids are unclear on why it is both harmful and wrong to use drugs? When you do not know where you are going, is it any wonder that you get lost? The failure of leadership demands a high price.                          ____________________
