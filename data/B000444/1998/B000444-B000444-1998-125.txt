  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the situation is this. We are just about out of time, but I have one more Senator on our side of the aisle who would like a couple of minutes.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Thompson have 2 minutes and Senator Harkin have 2 minutes, and Senator Biden and I have 2 minutes each for a close.
