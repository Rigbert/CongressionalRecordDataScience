 President, I rise today to introduce a bill that is based on the simple fairness principle that you should pay for what you get, no more and no less. In this case California water districts have been paying for years for conveyance capacity on the Folsom South Canal that they do not use.  This bill would direct the Secretary of the Interior to exclude and defer from the pooled, reimbursable costs of California's Central Valley Project, CVP, the capital costs of the unused capacity of the Folsom South Canal. Congressman Lungren has introduced similar legislation in the House of Representatives.  In 1970, two CVP contractors signed contracts with the Bureau of Reclamation to take water from the Folsom South Canal, which had yet to be built. The canal diverts water out of Lake Natomas, a regulating reservoir immediately downstream of Reclamation's Folsom Reservoir, to areas in southern Sacramento County.  The canal was originally designed to incorporate five ``reaches''--or sections--and deliver water to southern Sacramento County, San Joaquin County, and to the San Francisco Bay area. Because the planned East Side Division irrigation project was never constructed, the anticipated deliveries through the Folsom South Canal never materialized. Only two reaches of the canal were constructed, and those are dramatically overbuilt. In a departure from normal reclamation policy, which dictates that signed contracts are required prior to construction of projects, signed contracts were not obtained.  The canal was built with the capacity to deliver 2.5 million acre-feet of water per year, but the only entity currently diverting water through the canal--the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, SMUD--has only diverted a maximum of 20,000 acre-feet per year. In short, a significantly oversized canal has been used to deliver a very small quantity of water.  Under reclamation policy, the agency allocates the capital costs of the canal to the pool of all CVP municipal and industrial water--M&I--users regardless of whether they divert water through the Folsom South Canal. There are 32 M&I customers that are paying for the canal, including SMUD, Sacramento County Water District, East Bay MUD, Santa Clara Valley Water District and Contra Costa Water District. Today, only SMUD diverts any water through the canal, albeit only about 8 percent of the canal's capacity; the other customers have little or no benefit to the project that they fund. This inequity is difficult to explain to ratepayers that are already burdened with replacing aging infrastructure and upgrading water treatment technologies.  My legislation would direct the Secretary of the Interior to exclude and defer from those pooled reimbursable costs of the CVP, the costs of the unused capacity of the Folsom South Canal. While final deferral calculations will be performed by reclamation as directed by this bill, it is estimated that this bill will result in a deferral of approximately $35 million excess capacity costs.  The concept of deferring costs is not unique to the Folsom South Canal. Congress has authorized deferrals for other elements of the CVP and in other reclamation projects. Even though there are many instances where customers pay for unused capacity, there are no instances that come close to approaching the absurd inequity of being forced to pay for a canal that is producing 8 percent of what reclamation promised it would deliver.  Should the amount of CVP water conveyed through the Folsom South Canal change in the future, this bill includes a provision directing Interior to review the change and adjust the deferred costs accordingly for unused capacity.  I strongly believe this deferral is the correct approach to this issue. Reclamation made the decision to oversize this canal based on future planned expansions--expansions that did not materialize. The water districts that use the existing canal for limited conveyances should not pay for the consequences of public policy decisions that resulted in a significantly oversized canal. Water districts should pay for the canal conveyance capacity that they use--I think this is a fairness principle that we can all accept.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3798       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. CERTAIN AMOUNTS EXCLUDE AND DEFER FROM THE POOLED                    REIMBURSABLE COSTS RELATED TO THE CENTRAL                    VALLEY PROJECT.       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Interior (referred to      in this section as the ``Secretary'') shall exclude and defer      from the pooled reimbursable costs of the Central Valley      Project the reimbursable capital costs of the unused capacity      of the Folsom South Canal, Auburn-Folsom South Unit, Central      Valley Project.       (b) Calculation of Amount of Deferred Use.--The Secretary      shall calculate the amount to be assigned to deferred use as      soon as practical and such shall be reflected in future      years' water rates.       (c) Calculation of Capital Costs.--For the purpose of      calculating the excluded reimbursable cost for the Folsom      South Canal facility, the Secretary shall multiply the      existing total reimbursable cost for the facility by a      factor, to be determined by dividing the current minimum      unused conveyance capacity of the canal by the original      design conveyance capacity of the canal. The minimum unused      conveyance capacity of the canal shall--       (1) be determined by the Secretary;       (2) be based upon actual historic measured flows in the      canal and planned future flows; and       (3) include the amount of Central Valley Project water that      was originally conveyed or was historically projected to be      conveyed through the Folsom South Canal which may have been      contractually assigned to another entity.       (d) Review and Adjustment.--The Secretary shall review and      adjust--       (1) the amount described in subsection (b)(3) as      appropriate and recalculate the amount of such unused      capacity of the Folsom South Canal; and       (2) the amount of reimbursable capital costs of the Folsom      South Canal.       (e) Conveyance of Certain Water.--So long as an entity that      is allocated and that pays capital, interest, and operation      and maintenance costs associated with an amount of Central      Valley Project water historically assigned to the Folsom      South Canal does not use the Folsom South Canal for the      conveyance of Central Valley Project water, that entity shall      be entitled, without additional cost, to convey up to an      equivalent amount of non-Central Valley Project water through      the Folsom South Canal.                                 ______                                       By
