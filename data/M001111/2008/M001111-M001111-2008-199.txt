 President, today I honor Marc Hershman, a professor and former director of the University of Washington School of Marine Affairs and adjunct professor at the school of law, for his exceptional public service to our country. Since 1972, Professor Hershman has been a valued leader, colleague, and mentor in the fields of marine policy, coastal zone management, marine ports and transportation, and law.  Mr. President, it is my sad duty today to report that Professor Hershman passed away on Monday, February 18. Today, I want to extend my condolences to his entire family, including his wife Carol, his daughter Carla, his son Jordan, and his sister Susan.  Professor Hershman led faculty and students engaged in teaching and research on integrated coastal zone management, ports and transportation, living marine resource management, marine protected areas, impacts of climate change, and other ocean issues. He had more than 30 years of experience in the study of ocean and coastal law and policy. In 1972, he founded the Coastal Management Journal and served as its editor in chief. He served as president of The Coastal Society, was a cofounder of the Marine Affairs and Policy Association, and was an active member of the nationwide Ocean Governance Study Group. He was the founder and a board member of Odyssey Maritime Discovery Center on Seattle's central waterfront.  Over the years, Professor Hershman was the recipient of several awards in the marine policy field. As voted by his peers, he was the first to receive the biennial Orville T. Magoon Service Award, which recognized his long-time Achievement Award and was twice presented with the Distinguished Service Award from the Coastal Society. In 2001, at the recommendation of U.S. House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, Professor Hershman was selected by President George W. Bush to serve on the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy.  Recently, Professor Hershman was working on ocean policy in Washington State. He led 25 students in preparing ocean policy recommendations to the Governor's Ocean Policy Working Group. In collaboration with NOAA's Sea Grant Program and various State agencies, Professor Hershman developed the groundwork for a marine policy fellowship program in the State government, to be called the Hershman Fellowship.  I extend my condolences to Professor Hershman's family and friends. His passing is a loss not only to his family and those who knew him but to academia and the entire field of marine policy.                          ____________________
