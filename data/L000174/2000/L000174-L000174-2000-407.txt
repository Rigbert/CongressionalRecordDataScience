 Mr. President, I notice that the adjournment order has already been adopted. Respectfully, I do not believe that there is any intention of completing this matter today, tomorrow, or even next week. We have just barely filed a committee report.  This is a constitutional amendment. I think we ought, at least, to make sure Senators know that this is going to be the next matter coming up and that they have a chance to consider the report and the proposal. A constitutional amendment should not be rushed through this way, with all due respect. So I will object.  I will be happy to work with the distinguished majority leader, who has the added problems of having to make sure that the Senate does its work at the appropriate time. I will be happy to work with him on schedules and everything else on this, but because it is a constitutional amendment, I think we should treat it with more care and not just zing it off like this. We should have a real debate. I am not going to stop it from coming forward. I only want to make sure that everyone knows about it, that everyone has a chance to debate it and that everyone has the opportunity to offer amendments.
