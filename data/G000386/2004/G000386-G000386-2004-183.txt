 President, I would like to thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for his commitment to the Section 29 extension to new coke facilities. Although I am supportive of the provision, the most appropriate time to address it is during the conference. I look forward to working with Senator Santorum and the two Senators from Ohio to include this amendment in the conference report.                                privacy
