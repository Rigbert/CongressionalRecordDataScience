 They were disclosed to the FTC. What they show are competitors in the ethanol industry sharing bidding information to rig bids. One memo describes bringing European ethanol and laundering it through the Caribbean to avoid the tariff. These are hearings that are now going on in the House. I cannot, in the 5 minutes I have had these documents, have an opportunity to really confirm to anybody what they do or what they don't do. There are a number of suggestive comments in them, such as one company saying to the other: We are prepared to stop bidding should the price drop below $1.38 a gallon.  Interestingly enough, this all concerns ethanol going into your State, Washington, Madam President, a few years ago.  Whether this shows price manipulation or not, I don't know. But because these documents have just been made public this afternoon in the House, I ask unanimous consent to print them in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                  Western Ethanol Company LLC,                                               September 29, 2000.     To: Herbert Wolf     From: Doug Vind     Re: Sales Opportunity--Requires Immediate Attention/Response       Further to our telephone conversation of today, I am      writing to inform you of the details of a sales opportunity      for LAICA's anhydrous alcohol. In order to participate in      this opportunity, I must hear back from you by no later than      close of business on Tuesday October 2.       British Petroleum (``BP'') has scheduled an on-line reverse      auction to be conducted via the internet next week. They are      requesting pre-qualified ethanol suppliers to bid on      supplying product into the Ohio and Washington State markets      beginning November 2000 and running through January 2001. We      are interested in bidding to supply a portion of the volume      requested into Washington State. This Lot is broken into      partial supply percentages of 10,25,50 and 100%. The total      volume requested for Washington State is 9,600,000 gallons      over the 3 month period.       I am specifically recommending that LAICA consider      committing to this reverse auction the 38,000 HL it has      scheduled to receive from Europe. I believe this feedstock      will arrive Costa Rica sometime during the month of November      and be available for delivery into the US in December.       The delivery of denatured ethanol of BP into Washington      State can only be made by either Railcar or Barge. Direct      deliveries of undenatured ethanol cannot be accepted. For      this reason, WEC is prepared to source railcars of domestic      ethanol in order to supplement the volume coming from LAICA.      This would allow us to bid on up to 25% of the requested      volume, for a total of 2,400,000 gallons. We are also in      discussion with Man with regard to their participation for a      small piece of this business.       I expect that the winning bid for the 25% volume will be      somewhere in the upper $1.30's to low $1.40's. We are      prepared to stop bidding should the price drop below $1.38      per gallon. As I mentioned above, the delivery mode into      Washington State allows for only barge or railcar. In view of      this, it will be necessary to first discharge and denature      the imported ethanol. We then will schedule a barge to      transport the denatured ethanol to BP's terminal in Seattle.      I am in the process of verifying the barging, terminaling and      denaturing costs but I have been given a range of $.03--$0.4      per gallon. I should have this information on Monday.       I believe that the BP ``Request for Quotation'' presents a      very good sales opportunity for LAICA's anhydrous alcohol.      However, in order to participate in the on-line auction, WEC      needs to receive LAICA's commitment to supply the 38,000 HL.      We must obtain LAICA's commitment to this program by no later      than close of business next Tuesday.       For your guidance, I have enclosed a listing of the Lots to      be included in the Reverse Auction. As you will notice, we      will be required to participate in a ``Qualifying Round'' of      bidding on Wednesday September 3. This will enable us to move      on to the competitive bidding event scheduled for Friday      September 5.       I greatly appreciate your presenting this proposal to your      Board of Directors on Monday. I will be in my office and be      prepared to answer any further questions regarding this      matter.           Best regards,     Douglas Vind.                                  ____                                         Regent International,                                      Brea, CA, November 20, 1995.     To: Dick Bok, ADM Ingredients     From: Dick Vind       Finally received a phone call from Tuite at 3:30 PM PDT      USA. Jeff stated he had at last been successful in talking to      the Kriete's and they have agreed to split the tender with      us.       Jeff's only reservation was that Kriete insisted that Man      be the purchaser of the tender. In order to avoid a ``show      down'' or bidding contest, I agreed to this request.       Therefore, Man will be bidding on the 75,000 hl out of      France at a price of 5.02. I would suggest that ADM underbid      at a price of 4.85. This will serve as a safety net in the      event Man's bid is rejected for any reason. As a reminder,      bids are due in this Thursday, November 23.       With regards to the sharing, I made it explicitly clear to      Jeff that we (ADM & Western) would be purchasing the product      FOB Port-la-Nouvelle from Man on a totally transparent basis.      We would then assume responsibility for our own shipping      which presumably we would be able to coordinate jointly in      the future.       I would suggest you contact Tuite tomorrow at your      convenience to confirm and request a signed agreement between      both parties in order to assure compliance with this accord.           Best regards,     Dick.                                  ____                                                    June 17, 1996.     To: Dick Bok     From: Dick Vind     Subject: EU Wine Alcohol Tender--Due date: June 24       This will confirm that Archer Daniels Midland will be      bidding 5.9 ecu on Spanish tender (194-96) and somewhat less,      (say 5.75) on Italian tender (195-96).       I assume you have discussed with Man, and that all is OK.      Please call if this is not the case.       Hope all is well.           Best regards,     Dick.                                  ____                                         Regent International,                                                   March 18, 1992.     To: Ed Harjehausen, Archer Daniels Midland Co.     From: Doug Vind       Per our previous discussion, I have prepared a price and      cost comparison demonstrating the sensitivity of the proposed      bid price options and the resulting ``out turned'' finished      ethanol costs FOB Acajulta, El Salvador.                          FOB COST CALCULATION Bid Price (ECUs) Per Hectoliter.................     4.2     4.3     4.4Bid Price ($ per gallon)........................   .2336   .2392   .2448Fobbing.........................................   .1700   .1700   .1700Ocean Freight (in)..............................   .1350   .1350   .1350Inland Truck Freight (in).......................   .0147   .0147   .0147Raw Material Cost...............................   .5533   .5589   .5645Processing Costs................................   .3800   .3825   .3850FOB Value Plant.................................   .9333   .9414   .9495Inland Truck Freight (out)......................   .0147   .0147   .0147FOB Cost Port (Acajulta)........................   .9480   .9561   .9642                          VALUE ADDED CALCULATION Direct Costs....................................   .3450   .3475   .3500Divided by FOB Val.

For      purposes of this analysis, I have targeted a value added      percentage of 36.9%. This percentage should be adjusted to      reflect our mutual comfort level in order not to jeopardize      duty free qualifications. As one further observation, please      note the difference between ``processing costs'' and ``direct      costs''. This difference results from customs guidelines      limiting only certain types of costs as ``direct'' and      applicable to the Value Added calculation.       Recommendation: In reviewing the three lots being offered      by the EC for this tender, I suggest we bid ``competitively''      on lot number 77 and submit lower priced bids on lots 75 and      76 as ``back up'' bids in the event other potential      purchasers fail in their attempt to secure these two lots.       I recommend our bid price on lot number 77 should be 4.15      ECUs per hectoliter. I recommend our bid price on lots number      75 and 76 should be 4.10 ECUs per hectoliter each.       As you are aware, our bids must be formally submitted by      Friday, March 20, 1992. It will, therefore, be necessary to      communicate this pricing information to your office in London      by our close of business on Thursday.       Please give me a call with your recommendation after you      have reviewed this memo.           Regards.                                  ____                                           ED & F Man Alcohols                                    London, England, May 13, 1993.     To: Dick Vind,     From: Jeffrey Tuite     Regent International, Brea     El Salvador       On Tuesday evening I talked to the Kriets and here is what      was said.       They were still keen to make a bid on these tenders. I      cautioned once more against this. I said that Man would be      able to offer a compromise wherein Man offered 1 million      gallons when their plant was up and running. This would come      from these tenders and they would buy from Man and the      alcohol would be supplied equally by Vind and Hogan. Ideally      it would be swap deal with them returning the ethanol next      time around. In return it was expected that they did not      interfere with these tenders.       The Kriete response was that they were still very nervous      about being outmaneuvered and that we would block any alcohol      for them from the next round of June/July tenders. I said      that this was not the case and that if they could persuade      the Commission to call five lots next time we would support      them.       In summary Kriete is prepared to stay away from these      tenders if Man can guarantee that they will get 1.4 million      gallons from these tenders on a straight sale basis. I said      that 1 million gallons was more realistic. Tony Hogan is      prepared to make a straight sale and feels that this commits      him less to Krite and there is the point that Kriet may not      get any alcohol to return for one reason or another. My      recommendation to you is to make available a straight 500,000      gallons sale (preferrably 750,000!) without strings and I      feel this will mend things.       Can I please have your agreement to do this. I already have      Tony's agreement. Naturally Man will secure ADMs P Bond risk      for this sale.       I talked to George Fitch in Brussels today who is suffering      the usual frustration one gets in Brussels. He had little to      add to your fax of yesterday.       I will call you latter when I get home.

To: Dick Bok     From: Richard Vind     Subject: CBI Tenders                               MEMORANDUM       I appreciate your quick response. Given the politics in the      EU, I agree we should prepare ``bids as usual''.       As mentioned in our conversation this AM, I will have price      information for you on or before April 14.       My travel plans now are to go to Europe the week of April      18. Meetings in Brussels, probably 19/20.       I will not know my exact travel plans until probably April      12 so I will communicate my itinerary along with pricing      information prior to April 14 to your office.           Best regards,     Dick.                                  ____                             Western Petroleum Importers Inc.,                                                    July 13, 1998.     To: Jeff Tuite     From: Doug Vind       I had hoped to hear from you today regarding the situation      that has developed in the Northwest. You can imagine my      surprise and disappointment today to learn that the ``deal''      I have been discussing with you for the past several weeks      involving the shipment out of Costa Rica and El Salvador had      already been concluded last week. You can also imagine my      embarrassment with my customer when I called them today to      firm up the transaction only to learn that they had been      offered product which I had been previously told was not      available.       My current frustration with the recent sequence of events      is matched only by the humiliation of relying on what was      indicated as timely and accurate information, representing      that information as fact, and having my credibility at risk      when the ``facts'' changed.       As you are aware, I have been actively working with your      office in seeking a vessel to accommodate the delivery of      both parcels. Because the sale was to involve a direct      contract between Man and the customer, I revealed the      targeted value for the product to you for your concurrence,      which you provided. Late last week I attempted to reach you      several times to discuss this matter but did not receive the      benefit of a return call. As it turns out, you had already      concluded this transaction but elected not to inform me. A      simple call would have saved me from looking foolish today.       At this point I need to reconfirm your commitment to      providing the 900,000 gallons out of El Salvador in a joint      shipment sometime on or after mid August. As I have already      actively represented this volume as available for delivery, I      would prefer to avoid a repeat of today's confusion in the      event you have made other unilateral arrangements.       Additionally, I wish to discuss this entire situation with      you in greater detail in order to try and understand exactly      how things got off track. Please call me at your soonest      opportunity.                                                November 13, 1995.      To: George Fitch     From: Dick Vind     Subject: DGVI ``Doublespeak''       Please review the enclosed articles from a recent [October      20, 1995] issue of Agra Europe Magazine.       This article seems to completely refute Alex's comments      made to us at our meeting of last week. Although the lead      paragraph is not easily readable because the fax machine      ``ate'' it, what it says is that The Commission is increasing      the amount of compulsory distillation for this coming year      [1995-96] versus last year [1994-95] by 137,000 HL. Although      small, it nonetheless is a definite increase, and shows that      the total amount of alcohol to be distilled via compulsory      distillation for the three primary countries of Italy, Spain      and France for this coming year will be a total of 5,400,000      HL.       It must further noted that this year's total wine      production for these three countries is estimated to be      131,900,000 HL versus last year's 130,927,000 HL. With      compulsory distillation being 4% of the total, if you take      the total EU wine production of 155,400,000, this means that      a total of 6,216,000 HL will be available for EUstocks this      coming year.       It is apparent that there will continue to be significant      overproduction in the EU for years to come, in that the      Commission's efforts to reduce production have failed.       On a related matter, I have reviewed your memo to the CBI      group. Your suggestion on opening up future tenders to avoid      the GATT limits are troubling unless we couple it with some      type of end-use restriction. This is because, as you can also      see from the second article, notwithstanding what Tuite said      at the meeting, it appears that the Brazilians will be back      into the market in a big way next year. Unless we place some      type of restriction on end-use, they'll easily outbid us for      the entire EU output.       What happened to our end-use language we discussed with      Olsen last year?       I would appreciate your investigating these matters as soon      as possible and giving me the benefit of your thoughts. Also,      I want to report the results of my meeting with the SENPA      folks.     Dick.                                  ____                                         Regent International,                                      Brea, CA, November 20, 1995.
