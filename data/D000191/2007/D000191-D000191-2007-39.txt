Chairman, I offer an amendment.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:       Amendment No. 14 offered by Mr. DeFazio:       At the appropriate place in title XII of the bill (relating      to matters relating to foreign nations), insert the following      new section:     SEC. 12_. REQUIREMENTS CONCERNING THE USE OF MILITARY FORCE                    AGAINST IRAN.       (a) Rule of Construction.--No provision of law enacted      before the date of the enactment of this Act shall be      construed to authorize the use of military force by the      United States against Iran.       (b) Requirements.--Absent a national emergency created by      attack by Iran upon the United States, its territories or      possessions, or its armed forces, no funds appropriated      pursuant to an authorization of appropriations in this Act or      any other Act may be obligated or expended to initiate the      use of military force against Iran unless the President      receives authorization from Congress prior to initiating the      use of military force against Iran.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to House Resolution 403, the gentleman from Oregon and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.  Mr. Chairman, to address criticisms raised on the first amendment, this would not prevent retaliation for an attack upon U.S. troops. It would not prevent going into Iran to retrieve captured troops. But what it would do is say that we have not authorized, as some in this administration allege, a preemptive war against Iran because of the Iraq resolution or the 9/11 resolution. That simply is not true. They were not that all encompassing.  Further, it would also challenge a letter I had on April 18, 2002, from then-White House counsel, the esteemed Mr. Gonzales, who claims that the President has unilateral war-making authority under the Constitution.  No. This simply restates the Constitution of the United States and the War Powers Act. It is law, 93-148, and article I, section 8, of the Constitution.  This is not about whether or not military action against Iran is wise or necessary. Regardless of how you come down on that question, I urge you to support the amendment. It is not about binding the President's hands so he couldn't retaliate if they are involved in attacking our troops or capturing our troops in the area. It allows, as does the War Powers Act, in the event of any attack by Iran on the United States, its territories or possessions or Armed Forces, it is fully within the President's purview to respond.  There are many who are concerned about the growing nuclear capability of Iran, and I share those concerns. But the question that some day possibly in the future they might have a missile that could work, they might have nuclear weapons, does not dictate that we should have a preemptive war now; and if the President wants to make the case that that warrants a preemptive war, he should come to the war-making body, the Congress of the United States, make that case, present his evidence and have a lawful vote.  Plain and simple, that is all this amendment does, although I am certain other allegations will be made.
