 President, I rise today to commend Terry Meiners, a fellow Louisvillian and well-known radio personality. Mr. Meiners is not just a local institution on Kentucky's airwaves, but also a loving father.  This fall, for the first time both of Terry's two sons will leave home for college: eldest son Max, 20, will return to Western Kentucky University, and younger son Simon, 17, will enroll at the University of Kentucky. Terry has a great relationship with both of his sons and he has done an excellent job of preparing them for adulthood.  As we have just celebrated Father's Day, I thought it appropriate to share with my colleagues the story of Terry Meiners and his two sons. On June 18 of this year, the Louisville Courier-Journal published an article highlighting Terry's family life, career, and accomplishments, as well as his importance in the Louisville community. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Courier-Journal, June 18, 2006]                   What Kind of Dad is Terry Meiners?                           (By Angie Fenton)       It's 8:30 a.m., and Terry Meiners sits solemnly on a high-     backed metal chair looking out over the lush greenery      surrounding his pool.       He doesn't utter any of the quick-witted comebacks and zany      ramblings that are his trademark on his afternoon drive-time      show on WHAS radio. Instead, on this morning, he soaks up the      silence, broken only by the soft sound of a manmade waterfall      that cascades nearby and the sharp chirps from a pair of      cardinals flitting among the trees.       Soon, Meiners knows, the silence will reach painful      proportions when his eldest son, Max, 20, returns to Western      Kentucky University in the fall and his younger son, Simon,      17, starts his freshman year at the University of Kentucky.       ``I cried like a baby when Max rolled out of here (as a      freshman) at WKU,'' recalled Meiners, 49. ``It was torturous,      but I realized what a great passage it is for a kid to roll      out of his dad's driveway and into a wide open space.''       Once Meiners could no longer see Max's car careening down      the road, ``I sat in his room and let the tears roll--and let      it ride,'' he said.       After all, that's the way Meiners lives life, as if it were      one big ride with unexpected adventures, where heartbreak is      a part of the journey you've got to take in stride.       ``My dad is like a carpe diem kind of guy,'' Simon said, as      his brother poured milk into a bowl of cereal. ``He tries to      lead by example.''       One of the most beneficial lessons Meiners' young men have      learned from him is ``preparedness--and don't ever depend on      anyone,'' Max said.       Meiners also has taught his sons to laugh often.       The threesome share an affinity for ``The Simpsons.'' They      crack jokes, talk politics and quip easily with one another.       ``I've learned from my dad to live life to the fullest,''      Simon said, before admitting that he's been guilty of      trampling that fine line between full and full of it.       In May, Simon surprised his dad on-air by admitting that he      would walk at Manual     High School's commencement ceremony later that night, but      wouldn't receive his diploma because of his participation in      a senior prank involving mayonnaise and condoms.       ``I had to laugh to myself, but then my daddy genes kicked      in right away,'' Meiners said. ``I said, `Well, you know      we're going to have to talk about this later.' ``       Simon has since received his diploma after making amends      with the school, but he's also had a bit of punishment meted      out by his father: He'll be without wheels for his first      semester at UK.       ``I'm going to introduce him to a part of his body he's      never known before: his thumb,'' Meiners said.       The apple doesn't fall far from the tree, though, which is      why Meiners said he's firm but fair when it comes to holding      his sons accountable.       Meiners earned a bit of notoriety himself back in 1976 when      he broke a water pipe in Boyd Hall at UK after swinging on a      ceiling sprinkler.       ``It was during finals week at Christmastime, and they      couldn't shut the water off. The floor caved in, water      flooded the dorm and everybody had to sleep on mats at Alumni      Gym across the street,'' Meiners said. ``I was not a hero.''       The university booted Meiners out of the dorms ``and that      effectively ended my college career,'' he said. ``I was      already working in radio and went in to work on Monday and      said, `Well, I guess that didn't work out.' ''       Meiners has made it a habit of embracing a laissez-faire--     ``let do, let go, let pass''--attitude. ``I never get tired      of getting up in the morning and starting over. I tell my      boys all the time, `I can't wait to see what happens next.'      ''       But Dad can get real serious too.       ``You try coming home at 4 in the morning,'' Simon said.       ``And he's really serious about preparing for very odd      situations,'' Max added, which prompted a barrage of jokes      about how Meiners hides flashlights and other ``just in      case'' necessities in obscure places throughout the Anchorage      home.       Still, said Max, ``I admire his total passion for      everything he does in life. Whatever he does, he does      wholeheartedly.''       That includes grieving for his mother, Norma Jean Meiners,      who died on Dec. 12.       Just days after her death, Meiners was back on-air candidly      sharing his loss. Fans flooded his personal Web site with      well-wishes.       But his sons were concerned.       ``He lost weight from stress--we were worried about him,''      Max said. ``I know he has 13 brothers and sisters, but      sometimes it's like he doesn't have anyone to talk to.''       Yet, Meiners did what he somehow always seems to do: Let it      ride and roll with it.       ``The only thing you can do is will yourself into a      positive feeling. I try to teach my kids . . . to bring a      positive attitude to everything they do,'' Meiners said.       ``I am abundantly grateful for everything we have,'' he      said.       Meiners is also thankful for what blossomed in his life      after his mother's death.       ``It's given me an avenue to speak to my father (Mel) like      I've never before,'' Meiners said. ``My family and I, we've      surrounded my father.''       Even as they prepare to leave, Meiners' sons have      surrounded their father too.       ``I love my dad, and I'm thankful for everything he's done      for me,'' Max said. ``We've been through so much in the past      six months, this Father's Day will be special.''       Meiners agreed.       ``My perfect Father's Day is not possible. I'd like to go      back in time and remedy my missteps. But we're here now, and      I stand before (my sons) flawed but willing to learn,''      Meiners said.       ``The bottom line is that more than anything, I want to      make sure my sons are men of integrity. That's all that      matters. And I'm happy to report they are.''
