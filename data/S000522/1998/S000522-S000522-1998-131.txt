Mr. Speaker, I think it is becoming abundantly clear to a growing number of Americans that abortion is violence against children. Abortion methods rip and tear innocent, unborn babies to pieces. Abortion methods dismember children with razor blades attached to suction machines. Abortion methods include pumping and injecting deadly poisons into the baby for the express purpose of killing the child.  Abortion methods include killing the baby as he or she is actually being born. The partial birth abortion method, as we now know, entails jamming scissors into the child's skull and then vacuuming the brains out.  Abortion is violence against children, Mr. Speaker. Thus, it seems very clear to me that secretly transporting teenagers across State lines to procure abortions in a State with no parental notification or parental consent compounds the violence by exploiting the vulnerable minor.  Mr. Speaker, my colleagues may recall that when the partial birth abortion ban was debated on this floor many proabortion organizations, including Planned Parenthood Federation of America and their research arm, the Guttmacher Institute, wrote a letter saying that there were and I quote, ``fewer than 500'' partial birth abortions per year in the country, in the entire country.  That statement, just like other statements that they made, has turned out to be totally bogus. It turned out to be a lie. One leading proabortionist even said that he ``lied through his teeth'' on this issue.  It was a New Jersey newspaper, the Bergen Record, that broke the story that just one clinic in my State, the Metropolitan Medical Associates in Englewood, did about 1,500 partial birth abortions each and every year, many of them on teenagers. That's three times the number the abortion industry told us were performed in the entire nation.  Now we know that the Metropolitan Medical Associates and other abortion mills in New Jersey advertise and market their business in Pennsylvania and elsewhere, and use the fact that New Jersey does not have a parental consent or parental notice law as a way of luring young girls to that clinic and to other clinics.  If you look at this yellow page ad, promoting the Metropolitan MedicineAssociates Mr. Speaker, it stresses that pregnancies up to 24 weeks, 6 months, very large, very mature babies, can be terminated, that is--murdered--without parental knowledge, without parental consent. No waiting period, no parental consent, that is how they advertise in the Pennsylvania phone book.                              {time}  1430  These ads are telling young teens, ``Hey, we can end your baby's life, and your parents never need to know; it will be our secret.'' But if a teenager's secret abortion leads to complications, what then? Where is it written that the person driving the frightened and often very vulnerable 12 or 14 year old to an abortion mill is responsible? Who picks up the pieces of the shattered young girl when the bleeding, when the psychological and the emotional and the physical consequences set in? Obviously it will be her parents, or one of her parents. They will be responsible for and involved in her care after the abortion, when the disaster hits. The parents, should have had the chance to be involved without the circumventing of the more than 20 State laws that require parental involvement in this irreversible decision that takes a human life.  On May 21, Mr. Speaker, Joyce Farley testified before the House Committee on the Judiciary's Subcommittee on the Constitution, and she said, and I will quote her only briefly:  ``My daughter was a victim of several horrible crimes between the ages of 12 and 13. My child was provided alcohol, she was raped and then taken out of the State by a stranger to have an abortion. This stranger turned out to be the mother of the adult male who provided the alcohol and then raped my 12-year-old daughter while she was unconscious. The rapist's mother arranged for and paid for an abortion, and it was performed on her child. This woman lied and falsified records.''  And she goes on to say:  ``Following the abortion the mother of the rapist dropped off my physically and emotionally battered child in a town 40 miles away from our home. The plan was to keep the rape and the abortion secret.''  Then she goes on to say how, when she discovered the consequences, she then swung into action and did everything humanly possible to help her child who was bleeding and in severe pain.  We need to say, Mr. Speaker, that the law does indeed matter. These State laws are there for a purpose. Other States are contemplating parental-involvement statutes as we speak. We need to say that parents matter, and we need to help those vulnerable children who are being carried across State lines and pushed into abortion clinics by relative strangers and who in many cases have their own reasons for making sure that these girls get abortions.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, Americans overwhelmingly support the Child Custody Protection Act. When asked a very simple question that goes right to the core of parental responsibility, ``Should a person be able to take a minor girl across State lines without her parents' knowledge to get an abortion'', 85 percent of Americans said no; only 9 percent said yes.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this very pro-child, pro-family, pro-parent legislation that has been offered by the courageous pro-life leader, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen). I want to thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Canady) as well for his exemplary work in shepherding this legislation through, and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde) and all of us who had a part. It is a very important piece of legislation, and it will help our minor girls.
