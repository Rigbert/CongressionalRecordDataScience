Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. LaHood). Pursuant to the order of the House of Tuesday, March 30, 2004, all time for initial general debate has expired, and under that order, the Committee rises.  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Petri) having assumed the chair, Mr. LaHood, Chairman pro tempore of the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3550) to authorize funds for Federal-aid highways, highway safety programs, and transit programs, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                          ____________________
