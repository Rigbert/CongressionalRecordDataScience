Speaker, it is with great pleasure and high regards that I congratulate St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church in Gary, Indiana, as it celebrates its 84th anniversary as a parish this coming Sunday. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Reverend Everett Gray on this magnificent occasion.  From modest beginnings, St. Paul's has emerged as a cornerstone of the Gary community. The church was organized in 1916 through the efforts of six dedicated pioneers. The first structure was a portable building of the 21st Avenue school. Through the hard work of Reverend Martin VanBuren Bolden and the six founders, the membership continued to grow, and on July 17, 1917, two lotswere purchased at 1938 Adams Street. It was there that St. Paul's began to flourish as both a religious and a social institution.  During the Great Depression, the people of St. Paul's saw the needs of those around them and reached out a helping hand. The church basement was used as both a medical facility and a place where those in need could go for food. Their generosity was exemplified when the church donated money to those who could not afford the burial expenses for loved ones that had recently passed away. St. Paul's shaped the lives of many people during those hard times and still stands as a pillar of our community.  On May 1, 1943, St. Paul's welcomed Dr. Lester Kendal Jackson as its pastor, who made an immediate impact on his congregation. Under his leadership all outstanding debts were paid, and a significant balance was put into the treasury. He helped to organize many groups which would inspire the youth of the parish, including a literary society, Girl and Boy Scout teams, and a drama club. Dr. Jackson also fought for the rights of African Americans throughout the city of Gary, and was later inducted into the Steel City Hall of Fame for his contributions to the community.  After a fire in 1963 destroyed the building that they had used for over 45 years, the people of St. Paul's erected a new church at 2300 Grant Street on January 16, 1966. It is here that the church came under the direction of Reverend Everett Gray, or Pastor Gray, as he prefers to be addressed. Under Pastor's Gray's guidance, St. Paul's has continued to thrive, both in terms of spiritual growth as well as practical improvements.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me congratulating the parish family of St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church, under the guidance of Pastor Gray, as they celebrate their 84th anniversary. All current and former parishioners can be proud to say that they belong to the second oldest Baptist church in Gary, Indiana. They have weathered many storms in order to make countless significant contributions to their community throughout the past 84 years.                          ____________________
