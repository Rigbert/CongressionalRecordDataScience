 President, I am pleased to join Bill Roth, my good friend and colleague from Delaware, the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, in introducing legislation important to our State.  Small businesses are the cornerstone of our economy--in Delaware and across the rest of the country. They are key players in the record economic expansion we have enjoyed over the last seven years. They are engines of job growth and technical innovation, and they deserve not only our praise, but our support as well.  The Small Business Administration has many programs that can provide that support--including loan guarantee--through a national network of district offices. However, Delaware remains the only State in the Union that is without a Small Business Administration district office. The higher hurdles between Delaware small businesses and the services of the Small Business Administration reduce the value of those services to Delawareans.  That is why Senator Roth and I are introducing this legislation, that will guarantee that every state--including Delaware--will have its own Small Business Administration district office. This can be accomplished without any additional expenditures under the current Small Business Administration budget.  A district office in Delaware will make sure that Delaware businesses will enjoy the same access to Small Business Administration programs that their counterparts in other States now have. I look forward to working with Bill Roth, and Congressman Mike Castle in the House, to make this fair and sensible proposal a success in this session of Congress.                                 ______                                       By
