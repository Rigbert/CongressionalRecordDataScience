  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the President talks loosely and loudly of the pending crisis, the bankruptcy of Social Security. Under pessimistic assumptions, 40 or 50 years from today, Social Security might only be able to pay 75 percent, or more, of benefits. That could be described as a possible potential future problem but certainly not an immediate crisis and a long way from bankruptcy.  So what does the President propose? Privatization which would actually make Social Security shortfall certain, precipitate the crisis. He would mandate a 40 percent cut in benefits. Think of it. To solve the problem, a possible reduction in benefits by 25 percent, he mandates up front a 40 percent cut, then would borrow $2 trillion, put that on the back of the taxpayers and future workers so people could gamble possibly to try and make up that shortfall through privatized accounts and most probably would fail.  What a deal. Let us get real about it. Let us fix Social Security, not destroy it.                          ____________________
