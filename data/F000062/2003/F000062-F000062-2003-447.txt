 President, I rise today to introduce the Anti-Terrorism and Port Security Act of 2003, comprehensive legislation aimed at preventing and punishing a terrorist attack at or through one of our nation's 361 seaports. I would like to thank Senator Kyl for joining me in sponsoring this bill.  Currently, our seaports are the gaping hole in our nation's defense against terrorism. According to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics, about 13 million containers, twenty-foot equivalent units, came into United States ports in 2002.  However, the U.S. government inspected only about two or three percent of these containers--they rest were simply waved through. In addition, in almost every case, these inspections occurred after the containers arrive in the United States.  The problem is that a single container could contain 60,000 pounds of explosives--10 to 15 times the amount in the Ryder truck used to blow up the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City--and a single container ship can carry as many as 8,000 containers at one time.  Containers could easily be exploited to detonate a bomb that would destroy a bridge, seaport, or other critical infrastructure, causing mass destruction and killing thousands.  Worse, a suitcase-sized nuclear device or radiological ``dirty bomb'' could also be installed in a container and shipped to the United States. The odds are that the container would never be inspected.  And, even if the container was inspected, it would be too late. The weapon would already be in the United States--most likely near a major population center.  In addition, any attack on or through a seaport could have devastating economic consequences.  Excluding trade with Mexico and Canada, America's ports handle 95 percent of U.S. trade. Every year U.S. ports handle over 800 million tons of cargo valued at approximately $600 billion.  The West Coast labor disruption last year cost the U.S. economy somewhere $1-2 billion a day--a total of $10-20 billion. A terrorist attack would have an ever graver impact.  The U.S. would likely shut down all major U.S. ports, bringing thousands of factories to a standstill and leaving retailers with bare shelves within days. And this shut down will have a ripple effect around the globe, raising the cost exponentially.  In its December 2002 report, the Hart-Rudman Terrorism Task Force discussed the implications of a possible terrorist attack at a seaport. Here is what they said:       If an explosive device were loaded in a container and set      off in a port, it would almost automatically raise concern      about the integrity of the 21,000 containers that arrive in      U.S. ports each day and the many thousands more that arrive      by truck and rail across U.S. land borders. A three-to-four-     week closure of U.S. ports would bring the global container      industry to its knees. Megaports such as Rotterdam and      Singapore would have to close their gates to prevent boxes      from piling up on their limited pier space. Trucks, trains,      and barges would be stranded outside the terminals with no      way to unload their boxes. Boxes bound for the United States      would have to be unloaded from their outbound ships. Service      contracts would need to be renegotiated. As the system became      gridlocked, so would much of global commerce.  I am particularly concerned about such an attack because such an enormous proportion of U.S. foreign trade passes through my home state of California.  Last year, 6.2 million imported containers--48 percent--passed through California, 5.7 million just through two ports alone: the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach.  That means that, if terrorists succeeded in putting a weapon of mass destruction into a container undetected, there is about a one in two chance that this weapon would arrive and/or be detonated in Southern California.  And the problem is not just with containers.  Nearly one-quarter of all of California's imported crude oil is offloaded in one area. A suicide attack on a tanker at an offloading facility in this area could leave Southern California without refined fuels within a few days.  There is no doubt in my mind that terrorists are seeking to exploit vulnerabilities at our seaports right now.  Indeed, the Al Qaeda training manual specifically mentions seaports as a point of vulnerability in our security.  In addition, we know that Al Qaeda has already tried to attack American interests at and through seaports in the past. Let me mention some examples.  In October 2001, Italian authorities found an Egyptian man suspected ofhaving ties to Al Qaeda in a container bound for Canada. He had false identifications, maps of airports, a computer, a satellite phone, cameras, and plenty of cash on hand.  In October 2000, Al Qaeda operatives successfully carried out a deadly bombing attack against the U.S.S. Cole in the port of Yemen.  In 1998, Al Qaeda bombed the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Evidence suggests that the explosives the terrorists used were shipped to them by sea. And the investigation of the embassy bombings concluded that Bin Laden has close financial ties to various shipping companies.  We cannot afford to be complacent. Terrorists can be very patient. We cannot forget the successful attack on the World Trade Center on September 11 took place eight years after a relatively unsuccessful attack on the same target.  I introduced legislation in the last Congress to offer a comprehensive solution to the problem of seaport vulnerability. I am pleased that some of its provisions we adopted in some form by recent regulatory changes as well as the Maritime transportation Security Act of 2002 and Trade Act of 2002.  For example, one provision in my bill required shippers to provide manifest information to Customs at least 24 hours before departure from a foreign port. Soon after the bill was introduced, Customs published a draft regulation with the same requirement.  This requirement is now being enforced. However, Customs is still not getting all relevant information from every important party involved in the shipping process.  In addition, I am pleased that, especially in the last six months, Customs has aggressively promoted its Container Security Initiative (CSI). One of the core elements of this initiative involves placing U.S. Customs inspectors at major foreign seaports to pre-screen cargo containers before they were shipped to America.  Most of the biggest ports in the world are now participating in CSI. However, Customs has posted relatively few inspectors overseas and I believe that CSI can and should be expanded further.  The Maritime Transportation Safety Act of 2002 and Trade Act of 2002 also included a number of security measures.  However, in my view, many of these measures do not go nearly far enough, particularly in the areas of criminal penalties, pushing back the border, minimum port and security standards, employee identification cards, research and development, and so on. And even the strongest provisions in these bills are, in some cases, years away from implementation.  The bottom line is that, while we have made some modest improvements in seaport security in the last year, much more remains to be done. And, crucially, much remains to be done right now.  In fact, I believe that our seaports remain almost as vulnerable today as they were before September 11. That is why I am introducing the Anti-Terrorism and Port Security Act of 2003.  This legislation builds on improvements made to our laws in the last year but goes much further than those changes to ensure the security of our seaports.  The Anti-Terrorism and Port Security Act of 2003 does three main things:  First, the bill ensure that our criminal laws apply to deter and punish terrorists who choose to strike against our seaports. The bill closes a number of loopholes in our criminal laws to ensure that terrorists are held accountable for any attacks. Let me provide a couple of examples.  If a person blows up an airplane, he commits a crime. However, if he blows up a oil tanker, he does not commit a crime--unless he is doing it to injure the person.  If a person distributes explosives to a non-U.S. national, he commits a crime. But if the same person sows mines in the San Francisco harbor, he does not commit a crime.  Specifically, the bill would: Make it a crime for terrorists to attack a port or a cruise ship or deploy a weapon of mass destruction at or through a seaport. Make it a crime to put devices in U.S. waters that can destroy a ship or cargo or interfere with safe navigation or maritime commerce. Update our federal criminal piracy and privateering laws and increase penalties. Make it a crime to use a dangerous weapon or explosive to try to kill someone on board a passenger vessel. Make it a crime to fail to heave to (that is, to slow or stop) a vessel at the direction of a Coast Guard or other authorized federal law enforcement official seeking to board that vessel or to interfere with boarding by such an officer. Make it a crime to destroy an aid to maritime navigation, such as a buoy or shoal/breakwater light, maintained by the Coast Guard if this would endanger the safe navigation of a vessel. Make it a crime for terrorists or criminals to try to attack U.S. citizens or U.S. marine live by putting poisons in the water off shore. Require the Attorney General to issue regulations making it easier to determine the extent of crime and terrorism at seaports and improve communication between different law enforcement agencies involved at ports.  Second, the bill would help improve physical security at seaports by beefing up standards and ensuring greater coordination. Specific provisions would: Designate the Captain-of-the-Port as the primary authority for seaport security at each port. This would enable all parties involved in business at a port to understand who has final say on all security matters. Require minimum federal security standards for ports. These standards include restrictions on private vehicle access, a prohibition on unauthorized guns and explosives, and unauthorized physical access to terminal areas. They would also mandate that terminal areas at ports have a secure perimeter, monitored or locked access points, sufficient lighting, and son on. Mandate that all Customs inspectors have personal radiation detection pagers. Require all port employees and contractors to have biometric smart identification cards. Require Captains-of-the-Port to keep sensitive information on the port secure and protected. Such information would include, but not be limited to maps, blueprints, and information on the Internet.  Third, the bill would ensure that we devote our limited cargo inspection resources in the most efficient and effective manner. The bill would improve our shipment profiling system by requiring additional information from more relevant parties to the shipping process, and it would substantially improve container security. Specifically, it would establish a comprehensive risk profiling plan for the Customs Service to focus their limited inspection capabilities on high-risk cargo and containers. Under this plan, all relevant parties in the shipment process would provide electronically relevant and timely information to enable Customs to determine which shipments to inspect. Impose steep monetary sanctions for failure to comply with information filing requirements, including filing incorrect information (the current penalty is only up to a few thousand dollars). The Seaport Commission found that about \1/2\ of the information on ship manifests was inaccurate. Push U.S. security scrutiny beyond our nation's borders and improve our ability to monitor and inspect cargo and containers before they arrive near America's shores. If a weapon of mass destruction arrives in a U.S. port, it is too late. Require the use of high security seals on all containers coming into the U.S. Require that each container to be transported through U.S. ports receive a universal transaction number that could be used to track container movement from origin to destination. Require all empty containers destined for U.S. ports to be secured. Authorize pilot programs to develop high-tech seals and sensors, including those that would provide real-time evidence of container tampering to a monitor at a terminal. Require ports to provide space to Customs so that the agency is able to use non-intrusive inspection technology. In many cases, Customs has to keep this technology outside the port and bring it in every day, which prevents some of the best inspection technology (which is not portable) from being used. Require the Department of Homeland Security to take the relative number of imported containers received at each port into account in exercising its discretion in determining the allocation of funds appropriated for seaport security grants.  I believe that the Anti-Terrorism and Port Security Act of 2003 would make asignificant contribution to protecting America from terrorist attacks at or through our seaports. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.;  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 746       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
