 President, I thank the Democratic leader for his comments and his indication that he intends to support the measure before us.  I think if we have learned anything during this process, it is that a strategy to shut down the government over the issue of illegal immigration is something the American people didn't understand and would not have understood in the future. So I am glad we have gotten past that, and we have a chance now to get back to work.  Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call be waived.
