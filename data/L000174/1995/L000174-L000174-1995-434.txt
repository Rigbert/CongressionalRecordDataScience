President, I rise in support of the resolution on Kashmir submitted today by Senator Helms, which I am cosponsoring along with Senator Reid.  The situation in Kashmir has been a continuing concern of mine for many years. I am a friend of India, a country of nearly a billion people with great cultural and religious diversity and a myriad of problems. I have long believed that the United States and India have a tremendous amount to gain from closer relations. But I have been very disturbed by the excessive use of force by India's security forces in Kashmir, which has resulted in the detention, torture, and death of thousands of civilians. I am also very disturbed by the Pakistan Government's continuing assistance to the Kashmiri militants who have also been guilty of atrocities.  I am cosponsoring this resolution because I believe it is balanced, and because I believe the recommendations it contains are in the interests of India and Pakistan, and the Kashmiri people. It condemns acts of violence by both the Indian security forces and Kashmiri militants, and it welcomes the decision of the Indian Government to release Kashmiri political leaders who had been imprisoned.  Further, it urges the Indian Government to respond to continuing human [[Page S 8826]] rights violations in Kashmir. Specifically, the resolution calls for prosecution of those responsible for human rights violations, since far too often those implicated in abuses have gone unpunished, and it requests the Indian Government to permit international human rights and humanitarian groups access to Kashmir. This is long overdue.  In addition, the resolution recognizes the Pakistani Government's efforts to reduce its support for Kashmiri militants, and calls on the Pakistani Government to take further steps including using its influence with private Pakistani sources to stop the acts of intimidation and violence by Kashmiri militants. A recent report by the Arms Project of Human Rights Watch described the flow of military assistance from Pakistan that has contributed to the violence and bloodshed in Kashmir.  The resolution does not express a position on what the future status of Kashmir should be. Rather, we urge the Indian and Pakistani Governments to enter into negotiations with legitimate representatives of Jammu and Kashmir in order to resolve the conflict in a peaceful manner. It is widely recognized that there is no military solution to the Kashmir conflict. It is long past time that the various parties with an interest in the future of Kashmir engaged in a serious dialogue to end the violence.  Mr. President, this is a balanced resolution that seeks to encourage and support a search for peace in Kashmir, and I want to thank the Senator from South Carolina, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, for the constructive role he played in the drafting of the resolution. Our goal is to diffuse tensions in a dangerous region and to help resolve a bloody conflict that has caused enormous suffering over many years. The resolution should pass unanimously.                          ____________________
