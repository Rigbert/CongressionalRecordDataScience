 But when breaking up a cartel, which is ripping off the American people and people all over the world, that when taking on this cartel would hurt corporate America's interest, suddenly the silence is deafening.  I want to applaud the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) for raising this issue. I am going to stay on this issue.                              {time}  2030  I think the American people want the United States Trade Representative to go to Geneva and demand free trade in terms of the production of oil. We are concerned not only about what the rising price of oil and gas at the pumps means for people who are driving, but for the state of our whole economy and, clearly, Congress and the White House have to take some action on that.  Let me switch gears for a moment.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, just before we do that, just to go after this WTO thing for a moment, one of the concerns I have had about the WTO, and we are part of it, and I led the Democratic side with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Paul) leading the Republican side, on a vote to withdraw from the WTO last fall, and we were defeated resoundingly; I do not think we even got 100 votes, and people around the country should check out their Members of Congress and see how many of them voted to withdraw from this manipulated trade organization, which is set up for multinational corporations, not for consumers, not for the environment, not for people who consume energy, not for people concerned about working conditions, but for the corporations; that the U.S. has changed laws, weakened laws because the WTO has found against us because we wanted to protect dolphins; the WTO has found against the United States for clean air. We have to import dirty gasoline from overseas under WTO rules from Venezuela because they found our clean air restrictions were an illegal international trade constraint.  Under NAFTA, the horrible pollution of our water table about the substance called MTBE, the United States may have to pay Canada hundreds of millions of dollars under NAFTA to stop the production and the introduction of MTBE into poisoning our water supply, because of that trade agreement, and the U.S. accedes to all of these things. We pay the penalties, we repeal the laws. Not myself, but other Members of Congress vote for these things because they bow to the World Trade Organization and to the NAFTA tribunals.  But somehow, when it comes to the American consumers, when it comes to people pulling up to the pump in their cars, when it comes to people from my rural areas pulling up, and we hear a lot about Americans and their brand-new SUVs and the bad gas mileage, but I have a heck of a lot more people in my district who are driving their beat-up pickup trucks to the pump in the few rural gas stations we have left in my State, they are getting gouged twice as much as some of the big city folks, and somehow, the United States of America, the President of the United States cannot stand up for them in the World Trade Organization and against OPEC. I find that absolutely pathetic.  I would trace it back to the Rollcall I was reading before. The profits: Exxon-Mobil, $15.9 billion; Chevron, $5.1 billion; Texaco, $2.5 billion; Conoco, $1.9 billion; Philips Petroleum, $1.9 billion; Duke Energy, $1.8 billion; I am sorry, we are getting into electricity; maybe we will get to that later. Occidental Petroleum, $1.6 billion; and so on and so on. The list goes on and on. I think that has a little bit more to do with it than the fact that American consumers are getting gouged.
