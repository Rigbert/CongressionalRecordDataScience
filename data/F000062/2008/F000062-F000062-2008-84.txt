 President, 2 years ago I sponsored a resolution designating the third Friday in May as Endangered Species Day. This resolution passed by unanimous consent. There were no objections. The resolution was nonpartisan and noncontroversial.  The goal of Endangered Species Day was simple: to give students an opportunity to learn about the threats facing endangered and threatened species and the work being done to save them.  Last year, I introduced a similar resolution. Once again, it passed by unanimous consent and was noncontroversial. Over 60 events were held in cities across the country. It was used as an educational tool for teachers and a day for parents to take their children to the zoo.  This year the resolution was offered for a third time. It was thought it would pass quickly and without controversy. However, this was not the case. It was held up by an unknown Senator. We could not clear the hold, so we were unable to get unanimous consent to pass the resolution.  Now why is this important? The fact is that 90 events were scheduled in 28 States. Twenty events took place in California to commemorate the day. In my city of San Francisco, the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and the Farralones National Marine Sanctuary led nature hikes in search of the endangered tidewater goby and explained to children what they can do to save them. The Antelope Valley Conservancy hosted its third annual Endangered Species Day Conference that brought together Federal, State, and local leaders to discuss their recovery efforts. Similarly, the San Diego Zoo held public lectures on the affects that global climate change will have on endangered species.  These events still went on as planned. Teachers continued to educate their students about what we need to do as a Nation and at the local level to protect our planet and endangered species.  We know that global climate change, habitat destruction, and the illegal trade and hunting of endangered species carry serious consequences for their future survival. These threats are ongoing. More effective wildlife management programs are needed like those to save the California condor, least Bell's vireo songbird and the California grey whale.  I am disappointed that this noncontroversial resolution was prevented from passing. The goals of Endangered Species Day are simple and uncontroversial: to build awareness about the threats facing our planet's species. If we don't recognize these threats and act now to address them, our planet's endangered species may soon become our planet's extinct species. I am hopeful that all those who took part in last Friday's events came away knowing that more work needs to be done to protect our planet.                          ____________________
