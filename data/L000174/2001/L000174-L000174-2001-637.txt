President, I don't want to leave the impression in this Chamber that there is some kind of unanimity of law enforcement in opposition to Judge Ronnie White. In fact, a very substantial number in law enforcement in Missouri wrote to us, wrote to the Members of the Senate, and said they strongly supported Judge Ronnie White. One of the leading law enforcement organizations wrote to us and said they were distressed that he was not confirmed on the basis that somehow he might be pro-criminal.  The record showed that he voted with appointees by then-Governor Ashcroft something like 95 or 96 percent of the time in death penalty cases.
