Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information; and reclaiming my time, I wish to ask the gentleman just a few questions about other legislation.  It is my understanding the highway reauthorization bill has not been completed by the other body. It has not come back here. As the gentleman knows, it expires Sunday, I think. Does the gentleman have any idea of what action, if any, might be taken on this?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will continue to yield, I would just remind the gentleman the House passed a 4-month extension. It has been over in the Senate for some time. The Senate is having trouble with their rules to keep extraneous matters off of that bill, and they want to change the time of the extension.  So, unfortunately, we informed the Senate that the House has finished its business; and in order to accommodate the Senate with the 2-month extension, we would have to work with the minority to come up with a unanimous consent request to do that, because holding Members around for votes would be impossible. The Senate has a dilemma on their hands, and they are trying to work through it.
