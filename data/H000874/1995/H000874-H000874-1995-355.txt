Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman.  My colleagues, the issues with which we deal are emotional. There are a lot of strong feelings on both sides of the issues. We are different parties and sometimes antagonistic to one another's interests, and we are protagonists in debate. But the distribution of materials which are false, which are misleading and, in this case, totally inaccurate in undermining of the comity that we ought to have in this body.  I try to treat every person in this body with respect. In return, I expect to be treated with respect. I do not think I need to say more, but to want to say that the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Lightfoot] is one of those Members who I most respect and for whom I have a great deal of affection. I very much appreciate his comments.
