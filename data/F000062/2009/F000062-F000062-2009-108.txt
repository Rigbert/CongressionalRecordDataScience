 President, I urge a ``no'' vote. I am going to move to table at the appropriate time. If we adopt the Ensign motion, we cut Park Service dollars, Indian health dollars, particularly water infrastructure. Mr. President, $2.5 billion in this bill is for sewer grants; $1.8 billion is for fire suppression. It is the first time we have met the fire suppression need fully so that they do not have to take from other accounts to fight fires.  I move to table the motion to recommit.
