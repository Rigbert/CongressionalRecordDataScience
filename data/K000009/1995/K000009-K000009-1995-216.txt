Speaker, incredible as it may seem, certain promoters still claim NAFTA to be a success.  Eighteen thousand United States workers have already lost their jobs to Mexico with thousands more surely to be lost as more plants relocate to that cheap wage environment.  Our trade advantage with Mexico wiped out last year, and red ink is ahead of us as far as we can see.  A 50-percent peso devaluation in Mexico will dry up our consumer market for exports down there, and the $47 billion taxpayer backed bailout of Mexico and its Wall Street friends.  Tuesday's New York Times tells the story of Tracy Bartrom of Indiana. A former maintenance worker for Magnatek in Huntington, IN, she recalled a meeting she had in Mexico as she trained her replacement worker. Through a translator, she asked how much he was paid. He told her $1 an hour. And for him, the job is certainly not desirable as strong fumes cause nausea and vomiting.  The true story of NAFTA needs to be told, but it will never get the coverage that the O.J. Simpson trial gets on U.S. television.                          ____________________
