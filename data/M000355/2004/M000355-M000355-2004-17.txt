 President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of Kentucky's barons of bourbon, Master Distiller James ``Jimmy'' C. Russell. This year marks Jimmy's 50th year of service at the Wild Turkey Bourbon Distillery in Lawrenceburg, KY. Jimmy is so beloved at Wild Turkey, they named one of their finest products after him in 2000--the 10-year-old Russell's Reserve. I recently toured the Wild Turkey Bourbon Distillery, where Jimmy showed me the bourbon-making process personally. The bourbon distillery tradition in Kentucky dates back to 1789, and has been handed down through generations of Kentuckians. Bourbon is truly a Kentucky product--named, in fact, for Bourbon County, Kentucky. Ninety percent of all bourbon worldwide is made in the Bluegrass State, and one of the most famous brands is Wild Turkey.  Jimmy was born and raised just 5 miles from the Wild Turkey distillery, and both his grandfather and father worked there. Jimmy entered the family business in 1954 when he got his first job at the Lawrenceburg distillery. He mastered the craft under Mr. Bill Hughes, Wild Turkey's second Master Distiller, and Mr. Ernest W. Ripy Jr., the son of one of the original owners of Wild Turkey.  Jimmy is especially proud that the family tradition will continue, as his son, Eddie, has worked at the Wild Turkey distillery for the past twenty years.  Jimmy has become a legend in the distilled-spirits community over the last five decades. He is a director of the Kentucky Distillers Association, and spends time as a goodwill ambassador for Wild Turkey Bourbon. Throughout the Wild Turkey Bourbon Distillery, he is known as a ``master distillers' master distiller.''  Jimmy is a respected figure in his hometown of Lawrenceburg. He is a deacon at his local church and a supporter of Anderson County High School athletics. He also adores his wife of fifty years, Joretta, and their rose garden.  Today I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring and recognizing Mr. James C. Russell, Master Distiller, and his 50 years of loyal service to the Wild Turkey Bourbon Distillery and the Lawrenceburg, KY, community.                          ____________________
