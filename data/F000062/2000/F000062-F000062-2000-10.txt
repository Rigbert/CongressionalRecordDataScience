 President, I am pleased to have worked with Senator Collins on Senate passage of S. 2924, the ``Internet False Identification Prevention Act of 2000.'' This legislation is an important step forward in the fight against identity theft.  ``The Internet False Identification Prevention Act of 2000'' recognizes that the crime of identity theft has entered the Internet age, and that the Federal government has a responsibility to bring our identity theft laws up to speed. The primary law governing false identification documents was enacted in 1982, well before the advent of websites and e-mail.  Specifically, this legislation prohibits individuals from knowingly producing, distributing, or offering for download from the Internet computer files or templates that are designed to make counterfeit identification documents.  While the total number of false identification documents sold on the Internet is unknown, purveyors of false identification documents have used the Internet to sell their wares to a much broader market, and to distribute these documents as quickly as they can be downloaded from a website. According to a study by the Senate Committee of Government Affairs, one web site operator reported that he sold 1,000 fake IDs a month yielding $600,000 in annual sales.  The ``Internet False Identification Prevention Act of 2000'' also closes a loophole in current law that permitted manufacturers of false identification documents to escape liability by displaying a disclaimer, ``Not a Government Document.'' These disclaimers, however, can be easily removed. The bill also directs the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury to coordinate efforts to investigate and prosecute the distribution of false identification documents on the Internet.  I would note that this bill contains an exemption from criminal liability for certain ``interactive computer services.'' This language reflects a narrow, one-time solution and I want it to be clear that this should not be considered as a precedent.  Congress has debated the issue of whether the liability of certain Internet service providers should be limited with respect to particular activities of their subscribers or users of their services. This is a complicated question, requiring careful deliberation and evaluation of the short- and long-term consequences. A full debate on this issue is needed in the 107th Congress.                          ____________________
