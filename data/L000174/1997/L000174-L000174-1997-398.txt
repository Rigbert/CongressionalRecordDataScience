President, I have listened to the soothing words of my good friend from Mississippi, but they do not bring out the fact the Attorney General has already formed a task force of experienced prosecutors to investigate whether criminal conduct took place in the 1996 Federal election campaigns involving, as well, 30 agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation with subpoena power and testimony reportedly being heard before a grand jury. If a preliminary investigation is begun under the statute and an independent counsel is appointed, all this investigation stops, clang, like that. And to say that we are looking at Congress is interesting. If you read Senate Joint Resolution 22, it speaks only of investigating allegations of illegal fundraising in the 1996 Presidential election campaign. If you look at Senate Joint Resolution 23, which the majority leader wants tabled, itspeaks of Members of Congress as well as Presidential elections. It is very clear they do not want it going to the Members of Congress question.  I still say I am disappointed not to hear why we have broken decades and decades and decades of tradition to bring up something obviously aimed directly at the President of the United States as he leaves for a summit meeting with the President of the only other nuclear superpower. It has never been done, it has never been allowed by majority leaders of either Republicans or Democrats with either Republican or Democratic Presidents. Perhaps at some point in this Congress we will go back to the traditions of comity that we have seen before. But, in the meantime, let us vote on this resolution, but let us also vote on Senate Joint Resolution 23, which would include the Congress. I call on all my colleagues to be courageous enough to speak up and say we will support investigations of ourselves as well as the President.  I yield the floor.
