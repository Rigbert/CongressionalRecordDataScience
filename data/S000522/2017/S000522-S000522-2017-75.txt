Mr. Speaker, I rise today to announce that I have introduced the bipartisan Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism Act of 2017 (H.R. 1911), along with my colleagues and leadoriginal cosponsors, Brad Schneider, Peter Roskam, Eliot Engel, Randy Weber, Nita Lowey, Ted Deutch, Gus Bilirakis, and Marc Veasey are also original cosponsors.  I wrote the provisions of the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act of 2004 to create in the State Department the Office to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism and the Special Envoy to lead it. President Bush signed the bill into law and since then the Special Envoy and Office have been crucial tools in our global fight against Anti-Semitism.  However, as witnesses testified at a recent hearing I chaired on ``Anti-Semitism across Borders,'' the ninth hearing I have chaired on Anti-Semitism, Anti-Semitic hatred has metastasized across the ideological spectrum. Secularists, Islamists, extremists on the right, and extremists on the left, propagate Anti-Semitism. Violent Anti-Semitic attacks have become more frequent and perpetrators are learning from and sometimes even cooperating with each other across national boundaries.  It's urgent that we enhance the position of Special Envoy to match the threats to Jewish communities and make sure our response is strong and focused. This legislation:  Elevates the position of Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism to the rank of Ambassador;  Directs the Special Envoy to report directly to the Secretary of State;  Prohibits the Special Envoy from being double-hatted with another portfolio of issues;  Emphasizes that the Special Envoy should be a person of recognized distinction in the field of combating Anti-Semitism or religious freedom; and  Clarifies that Special Envoy shall be the primary advisor and coordinator for U.S. government efforts to monitor and combat Anti-Semitism and Anti-Semitic incitement in foreign countries.  Mr. Speaker, many leading groups support this bill, including Agudath Israel of America, American Jewish Committee, Anti-Defamation League, B'nai B'rith International, The Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, The Jewish Federations of North America, National Coalition Supporting Eurasian Jewry, Orthodox Union, Secure Community Network, Simon Wiesenthal Center, and the World Jewish Congress of North America.  I call on my colleagues to cosponsor this bill so that it moves through the Congress and gets to the President as soon as possible. With these enhancements, and full staffing, the Special Envoy can help ensure that America continues to lead the world toward defeating the ancient, unique evil of Anti-Semitism and keeping Jewish communities throughout the world safe and secure.                          ____________________
