Speaker. I rise today to congratulate 19 outstanding individuals who are celebrating 50 years of membership in the Croatian Fraternal Union Lodge 170. The festivities will begin this Sunday, May 5, with a mass at St. Joseph the Worker Church in Gary, IN, followed by a banquet at Lodge 170 in Merrillville, IN. The esteemed guest speaker at this celebratory event will be the Hon. John Buncich, Sheriff of Lake County, IN.  At this time, I would like to recognize the following members who be will honored on Sunday for their 50 years of membership in the Croatian Fraternal Union Lodge 170: Rosemary Adams, Bryan Magdaline; John V. Chelich; Alvin Eugene Erbesti; Lillian Gorski; Andy Horvatich; Pauline Jocha; Mary Klen; Francis Medved; Jennie Miller; Anna Mordi; Rosemary Petrovich; John Pitula; Shirley Pollizatto; Robert Razumich; Anne Wagner; Catherine Yavor; Catherine Zitz; and Christine Zivcic. These 19 members of Lodge 170 have lived up to the highest ideals of their solidarity with the people of Croatia and service to the Croatian-American population.  I would also like to recognize Ms. Elizabeth Morgavan, who has served as president of Lodge 170 for over 10 years. As an honorary lifetime member, she has dedicated her efforts to all facets of the Croatian Fraternal Union. In 1992, Elizabeth was named ``Woman of the Year'' by her peers at Lodge 170 for the countless hours she has dedicated to various projects and programs within the Lodge and the Croatian-American community.  Over the years, it has been my privilege and honor to work with the membership of the Croatian Fraternal Union Lodge 170. They have, in no uncertain terms, played a key role in promoting fraternal and cultural activity among the Croatian-American population of northwest Indiana. Lodge 170, the largest Croatian Fraternal Union lodge in the United States, has provided its many members with opportunities to share their ethnic heritage with their fellow countrymen. More importantly, Lodge 170 has provided social assistance and insurance benefits for its members, as well as other Croatian-Americans.  Mr. Speaker, I urge you and my other colleagues to join me in commending the dedication and longevity of all those who have served for 50 years as members of the Croatian Fraternal Union Lodge 170.           STATE OCCUPANCY STANDARDS AFFIRMATION ACT OF 1996                                 ______                           HON. BILL McCOLLUM                               of florida                    in the house of representatives                         Wednesday, May 1, 1996  Mr. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing a bill, the ``State Occupancy Standards Affirmation Act of 1996'' to assert the rights of States in establishing occupancy standards for housing providers. Currently, there is no Federal law to establish the number of people permitted to live in a housing unit. It is imperative that we ensure that States retain the right to set reasonable occupancy standards; my bill does just this.  There is a national consensus that the appropriate level for most apartment properties is two-people-per-bedroom. Most States have adopted a two-per-bedroom policy, and HUD's own guidelines state that this is an appropriate level to maintain public housing and section 8 housing. Beyond this level, the negative effects of overcrowding can be triggered, including decreasing the stock of affordable housing.  However, HUD's Fair Housing Office has initiated legal actions over the past 3 years. And then last July, HUD issued a memorandum, without any consultation, that would pressure housing providers to rent to substantially more than two-per-bedroom or be potentially subject to lawsuits charging discrimination against families.  All types of housing providers, including managers of seniors housing and public housing, were dismayed with HUD's proposal. If this change were permitted to stand, it would adversely impact all involved in housing, from tenants who could be crowded into inadequate housing, to housing providers who would have to provide services for more residents than they may be equipped for, and whose property would deteriorate.  In the fiscal year 1996 VA/HUD appropriations bill, Congress disallowed HUD from implementing its July memorandum. But we need to go one step further.  The bill I am introducing is a simple clarification of existing law and practice. It says that States, not HUD, will set occupancy standards and that a two-per-bedroom standard is reasonable in the absence of a State law. American taxpayers have spent billions of dollars on HUD programs designed to reduce crowding. It is time to ensure that overcrowding will not be a possibility.                          ____________________
