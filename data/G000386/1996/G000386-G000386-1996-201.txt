 The number needed to be reduced. The committee cut the number of generals from 1,073 in 1990 down to 858 by 1995. That is a reduction of 20 percent or, more specifically, 215 generals in total over a 5-year period of time.  Mr. President, how did this come about? What is the reasoning behind the reduction? By answering these questions, I hope to help my colleagues understand why the Armed Services Committee reduced the number of generals 6 years ago. If we understand why they did what they did 6 years ago, perhaps we can understand why they are ready to move in the opposite direction today.  The legislative history does contain important clues. It should help us solve this riddle. Back in 1990, the Armed Services Committee could see thehandwriting on the wall. They saw the cold war coming to an end. The Soviet military threat was evaporating, and the Defense Department was downsizing and doing it in earnest. In 1990, the committee predicted that there would be an overall force reduction of at least 25 percent between the years 1990 and 1995. Well, the committee's prediction was right on the money.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a table that shows how military end strengths have gradually declined since February 1987.  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                 Air                                     Fiscal year                             Total      Army      Navy      Force    Marine ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1987........................................................   2,174,217   780,815   586,842   607,035   199,5251988........................................................   2,138,213   771,847   592,570   576,446   197,3501989........................................................   2,130,229   769,741   592,652   570,880   196,9561990........................................................   2,043,705   732,403   579,417   535,233   196,6521991........................................................   1,985,555   710,821   570,262   510,432   194,0401992........................................................   1,807,177   610,450   541,883   470,315   184,5291993........................................................   1,705,103   572,423   509,950   444,351   178,3791994........................................................   1,610,490   541,343   468,662   426,327   174,1581995........................................................   1,518,224   508,559   434,617   400,409   174,6391996........................................................   1,493,391   499,145   428,412   393,400   172,434----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
