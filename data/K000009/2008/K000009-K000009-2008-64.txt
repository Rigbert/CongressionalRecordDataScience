Speaker, I seek to be recognized in order to officially for the first time on the Record place the passing from this life of our beloved colleague, Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones of Ohio's 11th District.  I would like to announce to my colleagues that after votes this evening, we will manage a special bereavement resolution. Many Members, I know, will want to pay tribute to Stephanie's beautiful life. We as Ohioans, as Buckeyes, share her son Mervyn's profound sense of loss; but also I know we share an equal gratitude for the manner in which she lived her life and what she contributed, not just to her family or her church family or her staff, but to our country and indeed to our world.  When Stephanie hugged many of us before we left in August, I can tell you I certainly didn't think I would be down here this evening. Any Member who wishes to honor her life can do so after the votes are cast this evening.  Let me just mention to my colleagues that we knew Stephanie here as Chair of the Ethics Committee and as the first African American woman to serve on the Ways and Means Committee. But her path was not an easy one. Coming from East Cleveland, she was a gregarious leader who blazed many trails.                              {time}  1900  She was one of the few women who have ever served in the Ohio delegation, and the first African American woman ever to be elected to the Congress of the United States from the State of Ohio. She was the first black woman to become a judge of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court, as well as the county's first African American prosecutor.  She gave so much to so many. I always seemed to catch Stephanie running through the airport with her suitcase, traveling somewhere, with that boundless energy and that constant smile; and we will pay tribute more fully to her later this evening.  To her son, Mervyn, who I would expect is listening this evening, we all know that your mother's strength will hold you now in a very profound way; and we extend our deepest sympathy to you. We know that in the years ahead you will come to appreciate even more what her life has meant to our country.  Mr. Speaker, I think my dear colleague, Mr. Boehner, the minority leader, has remarks at this time.  I will be happy to yield you time.
