Madam Speaker, the Shining Lights Award is presented to individuals who demonstrate dedication to public service and the highest level of character, integrity and ethics. Anchorage Project Access, Drs. Kaltenborn and Schumacher have themselves by embodying the Jewish value of Tikkun Olam for their selfless work in bringing medical care to Anchorage's most impoverished residents and have been selected as the 2009 recipients of the Shining Lights Award.  In today's economic climate, many people are forced to choose between food, rent, and their health. Anchorage Project Access (APA) is a volunteer network of 405 medical professionals designed to address the needs of over 15,000 people in our community who are uninsured and fall 200% below the poverty line. since 2005, APA has united health care providers, hospitals and ancillary organizations in an effort to provide basic medical care to those on a limited income. APA strives to reduce health care costs for all of us by promoting a model of health through ongoing care, reducing the unnecessary use of local emergency rooms.  Husband and wife team Drs. Cathie Schumacher and K.C. Kaltenborn were deeply involved in founding APA and continue to dedicate their time and energy to making this worthwhile project successful. Their tireless efforts to establish and nurture APA have benefited the entire Anchorage community and the State of Alaska.  I encourage everyone to reflect on their exemplary devotion to public service as an inspiration to use their own talents for the good of our community. Congratulations to Drs. Schumacher and Kaltenborn and thank you for all that you do!                          ____________________
