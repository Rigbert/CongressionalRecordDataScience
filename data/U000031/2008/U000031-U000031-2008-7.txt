Speaker, there is a reason why Congress is in the 9 percent favorable rating. We have not done the Nation's business. I look at former Chairman Barton sitting in the second row here. When we did the 2005 EPACT bill, we had lots of amendments here on the House floor, in fact, 23 different Democratic amendments, some amendments to amendments. And some of them would say at the end of the day that it was, in fact, a bipartisan bill because Congress worked its will. And I would say some of them were pro-energy. Frankly, some of them were anti-energy. One offered by Ms. Solis was described as an amendment that sought to delete refinery revitalization provisions in the bill. Thank goodness it was defeated. The bill moved forward, and it was signed into law.  But today we have a new bill that is hundreds of pages long. We haven't had a single hearing in subcommittee or full committee. We haven't had a single markup in subcommittee or full committee. And we have a rule that means when it comes to the House floor, there are no amendments allowed at all.  The Volt is an exciting new GM vehicle that is going to be in the showroom by 2010. It needs to be plugged in. We need to have electricity to make it move.
