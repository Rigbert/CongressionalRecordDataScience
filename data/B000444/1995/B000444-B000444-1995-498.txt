 President, I had asked that a quorum call be put into effect to determine whether or not I could agree with the unanimous consent request by the Senator from Colorado. I would just ask the Senator from California, when we conclude that, if I would be able to interrupt her to allow the Senator from Colorado to amend his amendment.  I do not seek that now, but I would like that so the Senator from Colorado does not think I have put this off for a couple hours.
