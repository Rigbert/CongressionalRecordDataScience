Chairman, I understand the gentleman's point. The point I was going to make is when the gentleman says we spend too much money, I agree with him. I am one of Democrats that voted on the balanced budget amendment. I agree that we need to live within our means. The point I want to make to my friends who are not on the Committee on Appropriations, is this is an OMB figure I read, it is not because we are spending more discretionary dollars. That is what we focus on because those are the bills on the floor.  In the tax bills, it is not entitlement bills, et cetera, et cetera, where we are spending the real money and when we look at those figures, that is where the additional expenditures are occurring that the gentleman is concerned about, not in the appropriations process.  I know it is difficult for Members who only get a chance to make their point only when we come to the appropriations process. So it is frustrating to say this is not the problem, but this is not the problem.
