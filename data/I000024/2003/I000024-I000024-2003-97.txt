President, I don't think there is any doubt but Ronald White is one of the most qualified nominees that we have been able to act on and confirm.  In addition to that, he comes from my hometown of Tulsa. I know him well and I know what he does. This is a generous person. He is famous for taking indigent cases and not charging fees.  The Margaret Hudson Program is a program to give alternatives to pregnant teens, and he gives his free legal counsel to that.  He is the type of person certainly deserving from his own personal lifestyle as well as his professional qualifications.  I heartily endorse him.
