 President, with all due respect to my good friend from Maine, his amendment makes everything permissible or able to be waived. There is no indication that this administration is interested, and, frankly, nor was the last one, in tightening the screws on Burma. If we want to do something about a pariah regime in Burma, tonight is the time. This is the vote. I hope all my colleagues will oppose the Cohen amendment.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of boycott resolutions, a list of letters supporting sanctions, and a group of editorials, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                          Boycott Resolutions       American Baptist Convention.       State of Massachusetts.       San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley, CA.       Santa Monica, CA.       Ann Arbor, MI.       Chicago, IL.       Madison, WI.       Seattle, WA.

William F. Weld's signature is a bill that      would prohibit the commonwealth from purchasing goods or      services from companies that do business with the      illegitimate military dictatorship ruling Burma. Weld should      sign this bill, not because it might work to his advantage in      the U.S. Senate contest with John F. Kerry, but because this      is legislation that embodies a principle of democratic      solidarity rooted deep in the American tradition.       The people of Burma voted overwhelmingly in 1990 for the      party of Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi. Although      her National League for Democracy won more than 80 percent of      the seats in Parliament, the State Law and Order Restoration      Council, or SLORC, thwarted the will of     the voters by seizing power and conducting a reign of terror.      The junta profits from a narcotics trade that exports more      than 60 percent of the heroin sold on the streets of American      cities. And because the uniformed thugs of SLORC have      accumulated tremendous debt, they are dependent upon foreign      aid and investment and are desperately trying to counter a      grass-roots campaign for American sanctions.       The timing of Weld's opportunity could not be more      fortuitous. State Rep. Byron Rushing's Selective      Contracting'' bill, modeled on legislation that helped end      apartheid in South Africa, reaches the governor at a time      when thousands of Burmese democrats have been risking their      lives each weekend to attend gatherings at Suu Kyi's house in      Rangoon, and when the Clinton administration has dispatched      envoys to Asian and European capitals to make the case for      multilateral sanctions.       If the envoys fail in their mission, a Senate bill proposed      by Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, and co-sponsored      by Democrats Patrick Moynihan of New York and Patrick Leahy      of Vermont, will ask the United States to take the lead, as      it once did for the people of Poland.       Weld has a chance to help protect Suu Kyi and her followers      and to encourage Washington to do the right thing.                                                                    ____                [From the New York Times, June 15, 1996]                           Burmese Repression       The Burmese military junta has outdone itself in      advertising its own crude ineptitude. Frustrated by the      popularity and prestige of their democratic opponent, Daw      Aung San Suu Kyi, the generals have now erected huge red      billboards denouncing the 1991 Nobel Peace laureate as a      foreign stooge. But every Burmese knows that Mrs. Aung San      Suu Kyi endured years of house arrest rather than leave the      country her father helped free from foreign rule. The real      threat to the Burmese people is the junta, formally known as      the State Law and Order Restoration Council, or Slorc.       The billboard blitz follows the recent detention of some      250 members of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for      Democracy, the undoubted winner of 1990 elections the Slorc      then nullified. When, despite the crackdown, she attracted      larger and larger crowds for speeches from her house, the      junta responded with a decree banning virtually all political      activities. So unwarranted were these measures that even      diffident Thailand and Japan have condemned Burmese human      rights abuses. Japan is the largest outside aid donor to the      country the Slorc has renamed Myanmar.       Washington has commendably taken the lead in generating      support for more effective collective measures to help the      beleaguered Burmese democrats. The Clinton Administration has      sent two senior diplomats, William Brown and Stanley Roth, to      sound out Myanmar's neighbors on taking stronger political      and economic measures against the Slorc. The mission itself      may help deter still harsher repression. Its findings may      also determine the feasibility of a ban on new American      investment, as proposed by Senator Mitch McConnell of      Kentucky, which the Administration is still weighing.       When the Slorc lifted Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's house arrest      last year, there was hope that the generals might loosen      their stranglehold on Myanmar. Unhappily, that has not proved      to be the case. Until the Burmese junta frees its political      prisoners and enters into genuine negotiations with Mrs. Aung      San Suu Kyi and her supporters, it merits the strongest      international condemnation.                                                                    ____               [From the Washington Post, July 20, 1996]                         Burma Beyond the Pale       On June 22, James ``Leo'' Nichols, 65, died in the Burmese      prison. His crime--for which he had been jailed for six      weeks, deprived of needed heart medication and perhaps      tortured with sleep deprivation--was ownership of a fax      machine. His true sin, in the eyes of the military dictators      who are running the beautiful and resource-rich country of      Burma into the ground, was friendship with Aung San Suu Kyi,      the courageous woman who won an overwhelming victory in      democratic elections six years ago but has been denied power      ever since.       Mr. Nichols's story is not unusual in Burma. The regime has      imprisoned hundreds of democracy activists and press-ganged      thousands of children and adults into slave labor. It      squanders huge sums of arms imported from China while leading      the world in heroin exports. But because Mr. Nichols had      served as consul for Switzerland and three Scandinavian      countries, his death or murder attracted more attention in      Europe. The European Parliament condemned the regime and      called for its economic and diplomatic isolation, to include      a cutoff of trade and investment. Two European breweries,      Carlsberg and Heineken, have said they will pull out of      Burma. And a leading Danish pension fund sold off its      holdings in Total, a French company that with the U.S. firm      Unocal is the biggest foreign investor.       These developments undercut those who have said the United      States should not support democracy in Burma because it would      be acting alone. In fact, strong U.S. action could resonate      and spur greater solidarity in favor of Nobel peace laureate      Aung San Suu Kyi and her rightful government. Already, the      Burmese currency has been tumbling, reflecting nervousness      about the regime's stability and the potential effects of a      Western boycott.       The United States has banned aid and multilateral loans to      the regime, but the junta still refuses to begin a dialogue      with Auug San Suu Kyi. Now there is an opportunity to send a      stronger message. The Senate next week is scheduled to      consider a pro-sanctions bill introduced by Sens. Mitch      McConnell (R-KY.) and Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.). This      would put Washington squarely on the side of the democrats.      Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who will meet next      week with counterparts from Burma's neighbors, should      challenge them to take stronger measures, since their policy      of ``constructive engagement'' has so clearly failed.       The most eloquent call for action came last week from Aung      San Suu Kyi herself, unbowed despite years of house arrest      and enforced separation from her husband and children. In a      video smuggled out, she called for ``the kind of sanctions      that will make it quite clear that economic change in Burma      is not possible without political change.'' The word      responded to similar calls from Nelson Mandela and Lech      Walesa. In memory of Mr. Nichols and his many unnamed      compatriots, it should do no less now.                                                                    ____                [From the Washington Post, May 28, 1996]                          The Bullies of Burma       The thuggish military men who rule Burma have now rounded      up more than 200 democracy activists who were planning to      meet last weekend. Again they show their regime, which goes      by the appropriately unappetizing acronym SLORC (State Law      and Order Restoration Council), to be worthy only of      international contempt.       To the extent that Americans are at all familiar with      Burma's plight, it is thanks to the courage of Aung San Suu      Kyi, leader of the nation's democracy movement. Her National      League for Democracy won an overwhelming victory in      parliamentary elections in 1990, but SLORC refused to give up      power, putting her under house arrest and jailing many of her      colleagues. Although Aung San Suu Kyi was nominally freed      last July, after winning the Nobel Peace Prize, the regime      has refused even to begin talks on a transition to democratic      rule.       It was to celebrate, as it were, the sixth anniversary of      those betrayed elections that Aung San Suu Kyi called a      meeting. In fear of the democrats' popularity, SLORC rounded      up many of her supporters, including should-be members of      parliament. This is far from SLORC's only abuse. Even before      the latest events, hundreds of political prisoners remained      in jail, according to Human Rights Watch/Asia. The regime      promotes forced labor, press-ganging citizens to act as      porters in areas of armed conflict and to build roads,      according to the U.S. State Department. It has built a      massive army, equipped mostly by China. And Burma is the      world's chief source of heroin.       The United States already has barred official aid or      government loans to Burma and has influenced the World Bank      and other multilateral organizations to follow suit. Now Sen.      Mitch McConnell of Kentucky wants to bar private investment      as well, a step supported by many of Burma's democrats. U.S.      firms are the third-largest investors, Sen. McConnell said,      led by Unocal Corp., which is helping develop Burma's natural      gas fields. The structure of the dictatorship ensures that      much of the benefit of foreign investment goes into the      generals' pockets.       The most active proponents of trade, investment and      engagement with Burma have been its neighbors in Southeast      Asia. A nation of 42 million with high literacy rates and      abundant natural resources, Burma cannot be ignored. But      after SLORC's latest abuses, the burden is on those advocates      of ``engagement'' to show what they have achieved and explain      why sanctions should not be tightened. As much as South      Africa under apartheid, Burma deserves to be a pariah until      SLORC has given way.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, is all time used up?
