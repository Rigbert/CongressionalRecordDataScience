Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 2786, introduced by my two colleagues, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Hudson) and the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette), has always been a bipartisan bill. It amends the Federal Power Act to promote renewable energy from small conduit hydropower facilities.  The bill would encourage the generation of electricity from existing manmade conduits operated for the distribution of water for agriculture, municipal, or industrial consumption.  I would note that Congress established qualifying conduit exemptions under the Hydropower Regulatory Efficiency Act of 2013. This bill, H.R. 2786, builds on that law to provide benefits to a greater range of conduit hydropower projects. This bill, in fact, will shorten the review period and allow larger conduit projects to be eligible for exemption from certain listing requirements.  I know of no serious objections to the bill. It is bipartisan, as it should be. I urge my colleagues to support it.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
