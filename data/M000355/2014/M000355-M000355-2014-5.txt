 There is no good reason not to.  We are working to clear an agreement on our side to process the CR/omnibus, the extenders bill, and TRIA tonight--tonight                 Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 5771.  As for right now, I can tell you we are prepared to go forward on the extenders bill. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the majority leader, after consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate proceed to consideration of H.R. 5771, the Tax Increase Prevention Act; that there be up to 1 hour of debate equally divided between the two leaders or their designees prior to the vote on passage of the bill; further, that the vote on passage be subject to a 60-vote affirmative threshold.
