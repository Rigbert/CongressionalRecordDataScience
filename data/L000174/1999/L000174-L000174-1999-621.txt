I am for that. I think it makes a great deal of sense.  What concerns me, I tell my friend from Idaho, is that what this is saying, in this court-stripping part, this says my State of Vermont is being told, even if they have a case, a qualified civil liability action pending, it will be dismissed by this. We do not even know whether there are such cases pending around the country, but we are telling the 50 States of this country and their legislatures: If you have a case pending, tough, the Senate has just decided it for you.  I am wondering, for example, whether this is covering current city lawsuits that are based, in part, on gun show sales. Some cities have brought some lawsuits based on gun show sales. Are we throwing their suits out?
