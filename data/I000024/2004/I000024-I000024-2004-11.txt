President, it is not very often that one has the opportunity to talk about someone they knew personally. We have so many fallen heroes in Iraq and in this war on terror. Those who have spent any time on the Armed Services Committee know that right now we are in the most threatened position our country has ever been in.  Today, I honor the memory of a really remarkable man whom I had the honor of meeting. In fact, I had the honor of meeting this man over in Iraq. It was around the time the U.N. building was bombed and I happened to be there at the time. He was over there with General Griffin, and I am speaking of BG Charles ``Ben'' Allen. He was a classic Oklahoman, a hard worker and leader who was dedicated to his family, his faith, and his country.  General Allen was an assistant commander in the 4th Infantry Division and was killed along with six other soldiers in the Blackhawk helicopter crash in central Texas.  Although he was born in Alaska, Ben Allen grew up in the Lawton/Fort Sill, OK, area, an Army town where the artillery is king of battle and familiar to all.  The son of an Army colonel, he graduated from Eisenhower High School in Lawton and went on to study at Lawton's Cameron University where he graduated from the ROTC program and was commissioned into the artillery.  General Allen's career was a long and distinguished one and included assignments with the 9th Infantry Division at Fort Lewis, WA, the 70th Field Artillery Detachment in Greece, the 7th Infantry Division at Fort Ord, CA, and the 9th Field Artillery in Heilbronn, Germany, the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, KY, where he was the operations officer for division artillery during Desert Shield and Desert Storm, and the 24th and 3rd Infantry Divisions at Fort Stewart, GA.  Allen then served as the J5 Balkans Branch Chief for the Joint staff at the Pentagon, after which he commanded the 4th Infantry Division's artillery and served in several positions under the Army deputy chief of staff for programming before returning to the 4th ID.  It is often said that when a soldier chooses a branch of service, he also is choosing the hometown of his future wife. Ben changed the order of that expectation. He and Cindy were college sweethearts at Cameron. In college, Cindy was a serious student who shared Ben's competitive spirit. For fun, the couple would compete for the highest GPA.  When Ben graduated from Cameron's ROTC program, he asked Cindy to marry him. She has been a partner, a friend, and a source of strength and truth, a cherished wife and beloved mother.  Cindy is a teacher by trade. For her, life in the military was a positive challenge which she took on with the same focused energy Ben showed whenever the Allens arrived at the new assignment. Cindy educated herself about each new duty assignment. She managed each move in an organized and disciplined way.  A lot of people do not understand what this is like for a family to be moved around this way, but Cindy handled it very well. Her leadership, responsibility, duty, love, and calm made her the perfect partner in life and love for this soldier. Even in this dark hour, Cindy is strong, dignified, and helping others cope with their losses as well.  Although General Allen was a man who faced the foes of the world with steely resolve, he stood no chance when it came to his only daughter, Laura, who is a 20-year-old student at George Mason University. Ben and Laura had a special father-daughter relationship fortified by great humor, warmth, understanding, and natural affection, a bond that will endure in her heart forever. She will always be his little girl.  I remember talking to him about this because my youngest daughter Katie and I also have that. To this day, I still call her my little girl. That is the relationship Ben had with Laura.  As the saying goes, like father like son, we likewise send our heartfelt condolences to General Allen's son Brian who is attending the University of Virginia on an ROTC scholarship. So we are talking now about the third generation. Brian and Ben shared many great times together watching their favorite teams, the Boston Red Sox and the Dallas Cowboys, and of course the University of Oklahoma, the No. 1 team in the Nation.  Whatever career path Brian chooses, he will have the life and accomplishments of a great and courageous man to serve as a bright and shining example for selfless service.  I will also share several thoughts about GEN Ben Allen that I have heard from some of my constituents who knew him. Many of these folks attended the memorial service held yesterday at Fort Sill. I was unable to be there because of votes here but I believe their comments say even more about the man, Ben Allen, than the long record of honorable service I just read.  Here are their words:       Ben Allen was known to be a soldier's soldier. He cared      about his troops and he enthusiastically led his troops to      achieve victory both on and off the battlefield. He was also      a soldier's son. Ben was the beloved son of a career Army      officer.  His father was a colonel.       Ben had a special talent for maintaining friendships. When      he arrived at new duty stations, he made a special effort to      seek out and reconnect with friends and colleagues from      previous assignments. Whether on the golf course or standing      on the bank of one of his favorite fishing holes, Ben could      make you feel as though only days had passed since he last      saw you.       Ben was a man of faith, with a great sense of humor. He      worked hard and expected the best from himself and from his      troops. He loved his family, the Army, his life, and his      country.  One friend suggested that this quotation from John Ruskin would be fitting in describing the way Ben Allen lived his life:       Tis a good and safe rule to sojourn in many places, as if      you meant to spend your life there, never omitting an      opportunity of doing a kindness or speaking a true word or      making a friend.  In this time of trouble and tragedy, we remember and pay tribute to General Allen and also to the many other Americans who do dangerous work not only overseas in places such as Iraq and Afghanistan, but within our own borders. Soldiering is a risky job. I am a veteran of the U.S. Army. I know there is no time you are not risking your life if you take this career. We should be grateful there are people like General Allen, people committed to defending freedom and truth, who are willing to take those risks on our behalf.  We remember Cindy, Brian, and Laura Allen, as well as General Allen's mother, Christine Allen Harper. We grieve for them, for their fallen husband and father and son. In his life and his death he set a high standard for all of us to follow. As we travel onward together, we will never forget BG Charles ``Ben'' Allen.  I know it is unusual to say something like this, but I have had occasion, just in the last few minutes, to talk to his wife Cindy. I recall something that he said to me when we were together over in Iraq. I said to him, ``Do you know Jesus?''  He was very straightforward, and he said, ``Yes.''  I talked to his wife about that. There was no doubt in his mind. For some who do not understand this, if you are a man of faith like Ben, we can assure you it is not: Goodbye, Ben. He is with Jesus now. It is: So long, we will see you soon.                         Corporal Bryan Wilson
