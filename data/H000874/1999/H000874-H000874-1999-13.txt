Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from Texas, for yielding time to me, and I thank the gentleman from California (Mr.Horn) for his comments. I thank both of them for their leadership in facilitating the movement of this bill to the floor today.  At the outset, I want to say what a privilege and pleasure it is to work with the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Portman), who is one of our finest Members, and who is one of our Members most focused on legislative accomplishments.  Too often we spend time trying to make political points, and I am involved in that and others are involved in that as well. But the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Portman) has been throughout his career focused on substantive accomplishment, and it is a real privilege and pleasure to work with the gentleman. I thank him for his leadership on this effort.  Mr. Speaker, over the years Congress, as has been pointed out, has created hundreds of programs, 600-plus, of categorical programs to help communities and families deal with various different issues. We did so because we wanted to make sure that the quality of life of our constituents was as good as it possibly could be.  Each of the programs was created, however, with its own nuanced rules and regulations. In some areas local needs do not fit specifically into the designations that are included in the programs. In other areas, there is overlapping and the programs duplicate each other.  For many years as a member of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, I have talked to the secretaries of those three departments about coordinating their programs so that, whether it is a child or a worker or family, that that family could more easily access the services available across departmental lines.  This bill deals specifically with making sure that grant applicants have an easier time and a more efficient time and a less expensive time in accessing dollars that we want to get as simply and directly as possible to the recipients that are intended to be the beneficiaries of the programs we adopt.  Right now caseworkers spend far too much time dealing with red tape and paperwork. The Federal government has created hundreds of different taps through which assistance flows. Communities, programs, and families must run from tap to tap in many instances with a bucket to help the people that we want to help so well.  One of the analogies I have made is that it is a shame at the Federal level we do not say we want to help child A or family B, and we have a lot of different programs to do that from a lot of different departments, whether it is housing, whether it is nutritional programs out of agriculture, whether it is job programs out of the Department of Labor, education programs out of the Department of Education, Head Start out of HHS, a myriad number of programs, it is a shame that we do not really have a big funnel up here with a spout, and child Mary or family A or B would get the programs coordinated for them by us, that we created. This bill goes some way towards doing that.  I want to again congratulate the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Portman) for his leadership on this. It requires the Office of Management and Budget to work with other Federal agencies to establish a uniform application for financial assistance for multiple programs across multiple Federal agencies.  That seems to make a lot of sense, as the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Turner) has said, but it really has not happened too often. Each agency has had its own perspective on one little question that it had to have answered so that it would approve the application, where the other agency did not need the answer to that question, it needed an answer to another question.  Mr. Speaker, it is all the same tax dollars appropriated by and authorized by the same Congress, and what this legislation says is, come on, fellows, let us get our act together and let us have the locals tell us what we need to know in a uniform way, rely on that, and get that grant money out to them without them wasting dollars on administrative procedures.  Some people denigrate bureaucrats. I do not do that, I represent a lot of them. But that does not mean I want to see a proliferation of bureaucracy that money for children and families goes to, simply trying to get through the system. It is critically important not to have to deal with all kinds of different forms when basically the information we are seeking is the same.  Secondly, this bill will simplify reporting requirements and administrative procedures, and again facilitate, not impede, dollars getting to people that we at the Federal level, our State colleagues and local colleagues, all want to assist.  Thirdly, Mr. Speaker, it will develop electronic methods. My friend, the gentleman from Ohio, spoke about that. This is a critically important aspect of this legislation. I was pleased to ensure that we got this online, so to speak, as quickly as possible. It will help develop electronic methods for applying for and reporting of Federal financial assistance funds. I think, as I have said, that this is critically important. In my opinion, the Federal Government's responsibility will be facilitated by this act.  I agree with the gentleman from Texas, and I know the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Portman) does as well, we are not saying that we do not want full accountability. We have a responsibility to the taxpayers when we authorize and appropriate this money that the money will be spent in a manner that is effective and accomplishes the result for which it is planned.  On the other hand, we want to facilitate, not impede, the application of those dollars, while at the same time requiring accountability.                              {time}  1315  I believe that S. 468 and the House bill that we are now considering will add a much-needed focus on the coordination of program requirements, both within and across Federal departments.  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to mention what I mention a lot of times on this floor, unfortunately, the American public that watches C-SPAN sees too often us fighting with one another, and they do so because really what gets on this floor most of the time is the disagreements that we have, because the agreements that we have are done in a much briefer time frame and do not get the focus that the disagreements get.  Here is a perfect example of a bipartisan piece of legislation worked on by the majority party and its leadership and the gentleman from California (Mr. Horn), the minority party and our leadership, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Turner), resulting in a bill put together by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Portman), with my help, but he has been the leader on this, he really took up where Senator Glenn left off when Senator Glenn left. That is, I think, going to make a very significant, perhaps not front page news but nevertheless significant step forward for facilitating the application of Federal funds in an efficient and effective manner to make the lives of our constituents better.  I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Portman) for his leadership and work on this issue. As I said, it has been a pleasure working with him, and I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Horn) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Turner).
