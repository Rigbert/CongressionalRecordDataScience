President, I rise today to introduce legislation which will protect the Constitutionally-guaranteed exercise of free speech and exercise of religion, the Religious Freedom Act of 2006.  The American people may be surprised to learn a few things about their government's relationship with religion. They may be surprised to learn that the Federal Government of the United States of America, in the land of the free, does not allow religious leaders in houses of worship of all religious orders to say anything that might be construed as political in nature. The American people may further be surprised to learn that the federal agency tasked with enforcing the absolute ban on political speech for houses of worship is the Internal Revenue Service. It is the IRS that reviews the content of sermons and homilies and threatens to revoke those institutions' tax-exempt status if they dare to speak out on the political matters of the day. Many times, the only evidence on which the IRS will base their case is a third-party complaint and may move forward with threatening letters and the revocation of their tax-exempt status even if the prohibited activities--the exercise of their First Amendment Rights--were incidental or unintentional. Furthermore, the IRS admits that it applies a ``coded language'' policy to political speech. That is, discussion of a moral issue, if it happens to be a matter discussed in our public debates, is a political issue and is consequently banned by the IRS. The American people may even be more surprised to learn that the IRS is stepping up the enforcement of the ban on political speech in houses of worship and has recently emphasized the ``coded language'' policy.  A skeptic might assert that something as serious as an IRS-enforced ban on political discourse in a church must have a tenured legislative history buttressed by decades of sound First Amendment jurisprudence. The American people may be surprised to learn that the exact opposite is true. The First Amendment freedoms of houses of worship were stripped away in 1954 by the ``Johnson Amendment,'' a floor amendment named for then-Senator Lyndon Johnson, which placed an absolute ban on political speech by tax exempt organizations. Although the legislative record is relatively silent on this matter, the amendment and its subsequent ban were enacted without a hearing, any debate, or any public comment. History also indicates that Senator Johnson enacted this ban as a means of silencing some anticommunist nonprofits that were mobilizing against his political campaign. It now silences important comment on the issues of the day. Although the Supreme Court has affirmed and reaffirmed a ``profound national commitment'' to the proposition that debate on issues should be ``uninhibited, robust, and wide-open,'' the debate has been unconstitutionally restricted for nearly 50 years.  Whereas the legislative history of the Johnson Amendment is dubious where it even exists, the history of the relationship between politics and the pulpit is a history of a positive force for change in momentous times in our history when we as a nation have reaffirmed our commitment to an open and tolerant society. From slavery to segregation, religious leaders in America clearly have been effective forces for good, and they are also for more modern issues such as abortion, assisted suicide, and human trafficking. Perhaps no one could better articulate an important aspect of the history of politics and the pulpit than Martin Luther King, Jr.: ``The church must be reminded that it is not the master or the servant of the state, but rather the conscience of the state. It must be the guide and the critic of the state, and never its tool . . . [or] it will become an irrelevant social club without moral or spiritual authority.'' The Johnson Amendment silences the ``conscience of the state.'' It's difficult to see how religious leaders can in any way continue to function as Martin Luther King Jr.'s ideal of the church as the ``conscience of the state,'' as the church has done so effectively during trying times for our state, when houses of worship are banned absolutely from discussing matters of the state.  The moral questions of the day are more often than not also fundamental social and political questions--questions that concern what we value as a nation. It is truly astounding that today, in America, religious leaders are banned from any comment on those moral issues. It is not partisan; this ban on speech makes no distinction between the ideological divide of left versus right in America: one church leader is investigated for publicly opposing abortion and another for discussing the morality of the Iraq War. Indeed, the American people may be surprised to learn this about their country.  The American people would allowing religious leaders, of all kinds, to speak their consciences on the issues facing our nation, and to do so without the threat of IRS punishment through the revocation of their tax-exempt status. This is why I am introducing legislation that will do just that. The Religious Freedom Act of 2006 simply states that religious leaders may discuss political matters, as a Constitutionally protected right, without the threat of an IRS investigation. Upon enactment, this bill will reaffirm the Supreme Court's holding that this country has a ``profound national commitment'' to a national debate that is ``uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.'' It will also reaffirm Martin Luther King, Jr.'s ideal of churches as the ``conscience of the state.'' I ask that the text of this statement be included in the Congressional Record by unanimous consent.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3957       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Religious Freedom Act of      2006''.     SEC. 2. PROTECTION OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH FOR HOUSES OF WORSHIP                    OR MEDITATION.
