Can the leader tell us whether there is anticipation on your side of the aisle that we will be considering either one of those or both? Campaign finance, I know there are two separate pieces of legislation, Pence-Wynn and Shays-Meehan, pending. Will either one of those subjects, do you think, be on the calendar prior to the July 28 recess date?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman continuing to yield, and I assume the gentleman will ask another question about Social Security, so I will take campaign finance first.  There is a lot of negotiations that need to be held on both the Shays-Meehan bill and the Pence-Wynn bill. In my opinion, they are not ripe yet. I do not see that they will get any riper between now and the August break.
