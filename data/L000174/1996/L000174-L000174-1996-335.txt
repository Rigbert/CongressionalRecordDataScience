I plan to work closely with these Vermont programs so that they can continue to providing services through AmeriCorps. And I appreciate all of the work the Senators have done to come to a bipartisan agreement on funding for AmeriCorps. I look forward to continue working with them on this important issue.                          veterans health care  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we need to take immediate steps to implement a plan to better allocate health care funding among the Department's health care facilities so that veterans, no matter where they live or what circumstances they face, have equal access to quality health care.  The amendment that I propose here today with my distinguished colleague, Senator Bob Graham of Florida, will, I hope, finally direct the Department of Veterans Affairs to do the right thing. That is, to eliminate funding disparities among VA health care facilities across the country.  Mr. President, inequity in veterans' access to health care is an issue that I originally brought to Secretary Jesse Brown's attention in March 1994. The Department of Veterans Affairs is currently using an archaic and unresponsive formula to allocate health care resources. The system must be updated to account for population shifts.  The veterans population in three States, including Arizona, is growing, at the same time that it is declining in other parts of the country. Unfortunately, health care allocations have not kept up with the changes. The impact of disparate funding has been very obvious to me during my visits to many VA medical centers throughout the country, and particularly in Arizona, and was confirmed by a formal survey of the Carl T. Hayden VA Medical Center in Phoenix, which was conducted by the Veterans of Foreign Wars [VFW] in April 1994.  The problem has been further verified by the General Accounting Office [GAO] in a report entitled ``Veterans Health Care: Facilities' Resource Allocations Could Be More Equitable.'' The GAO found that the Department of Veterans Affairs continues to allocate funding based on past budgets rather than current needs, and has failed to implement the Resource Planning and Management system [RPM] developed 2 years ago to help remedy funding inequity.  Mr. President, the GAO cites VA data that the workload of some facilities increased by as much as 15 percent between 1993 and 1995, while the workload of others declined by as much as 8 percent. However, in the two budget cycles studied, the VA made only minimal changes in funding allocations. The maximum loss to a facility was 1 percent of its past budget and the average gain was also about 1 percent.  This inadequate response to demographic change over the past decade is very disturbing, and, I believe, wrong. To illustrate the problem, I would point out that the Carl T. Hayden VA Medical Center experienced the third highest workload growth based on 17 hospitals of similar size and mission, yet was only funded at less than half the RPM process.  Mr. President, the GAO informs me that rather than implementing the RPM process to remedy funding inequities in access to veterans health care, the VA has resorted to rationing health care or eliminating health care to certain veterans in areas of high demand.  The GAO says:       Because of differences in facility rationing practices,      veterans' access to care system wide is uneven. We found that      higher income veterans received care at many facilities,      while lower income veterans were turned away at other      facilities. Differences in who was served occurred even      within the same facility because of rationing.The GAO also indicates that there is confusion among the Department's staff regarding the reasons for funding variations among the VA facilities and the purpose of the RPM system.  Mr. President, this problem must be addressed now. This amendment compels the VA to take expeditious action to remedy this serious problem and adequately address the changes in demand at VA facilities.  To conclude, I want to reiterate that I find it simply unconscionable that the VA could place the Carl T. Hayden VA Medical Center at the bottom of the funding ladder, when the three VA medical facilities in the State of Arizona must care for a growing number of veterans, and are inundated every year by winter visitors, which places an additional burden on the facilities.  I ask unanimous consent that the VFW survey and the GAO summary report be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       Veterans of Foreign Wars of                                            the United States,                                    Washington, DC, April 7, 1994.     John T. Farrar, M.D.,     Acting Under Secretary for Health (10), Veterans Health          Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs,          Washington, DC.       Dear Dr. Farrar: A member of my staff, Robert F. O'Toole,      Senior Field Representative, conducted a survey of the      Phoenix, Arizona, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical      Center, on March 14-15, 1994. During his time at the medical      center, he was able to talk with many patients, family      members and staff. This enabled him to gather information      concerning the quality of care being provided and the most      pressing problems facing the facility.       While those receiving treatment in the clinics and wards      felt that the quality was good, they almost all commented on      the long waits in the clinics and the understaffing      throughout the medical center. In discussing their problem      with various staff members, it was noted that nurses were      under extreme stress. More than one was observed by Mr.      O'Toole in tears when completing their tour. The nursing      staff on evening shifts must rush continually through their      duties in an attempt to cover all their patients needs due to      the shortage in staffing in both support and technical      personnel.       In attempting to determine the reason for this problem, it      became apparent that the station was grossly underfunded.      Which means that the staff must either take unwanted      shortcuts or continue to work beyond the point expected of      staffs at the other medical centers. While it is well      understood that the Veterans Health Administration is      underfunded throughout the system, it is clear from the      comparisons that this facility has not received a fair      distribution of the available resources resulting in the      deplorable situation now facing the health care team.       Another problem in Phoenix that must be addressed is the      serious space deficiency, especially in the clinical areas.      The ambulatory care area was designed to handle 60,000 annual      visits. In fiscal year 1993, the station provided 218,000      annual visits, almost four times the design level. Many      physicians are required to conduct exams and provide      treatment from temporary cubicles set up inside the waiting      rooms. This bandaid approach has added to the already      overcrowding.       The other problem that we feel should be pointed out is      that of the staffing ceiling assigned to the Carl T. Hayden      Veterans Medical Center. Currently, the medical center has a      FTE of 1530 which is over the target staffing level. Based on      available reports, the medical center would need an      additional 61 registered nurses just to reach the average      Resource Program Management (RPM) within their group. This      facility operates with the lowest employee level in their      group when comparing facility work loads, and 158th overall.      To reach the average productivity level of the Veterans      Health Administration medical centers, they would need an      additional 348 full-time employees. While it is realized that      this station will never be permitted to enjoy that level of      staffing, it is felt that they, at the least, should have      been given some consideration for their staffing problems      during the latest White House ordered employee reductions.       To assist the medical center to meet their mandatory work      load, and the great influx of winter residents, it is      recommended that the $11.4 million which was reported to the      Arizona congressional delegation to have been given Phoenix      in addition to their FY 94 budget be provided. To enable the      station to handle the ever increasing ambulatory work load,      the Veterans Health Administration must approve the pending      request for leased clinic space in northwest Phoenix and, the      implementation plan for the use of the Williams Air Force      Base hospital as a satellite outpatient clinic, along with      the necessary funding to adequately operate the facility. In      addition, VHA should approve and fund, at a minimum, the      expansion of the medical centers clinical space onto the      Indian School land which was acquired for that purpose.       Approval of the above recommendations would make it much      easier for this medical center to meet the needs of the ever      increasing veteran population in the Phoenix area. There is      no indication that the increasing population trends will      change prior to the year 2020. This hospital cannot be      allowed to continue the downhill slide. The veterans of      Arizona deserve a fair deal and the medical staff should be      given the opportunity to provide top quality health care in a      much less stressful setting.       I would appreciate receiving your comments on the Phoenix      VA Medical Center at your earliest opportunity.           Sincerely,                                            Frederico Juarbe, Jr.,                              Director, National Veterans Service.                                 ______         U.S. General Accounting Office, Health, Education, and            Human Services Division,                                 Washington, DC, February 7, 1996.     Hon. John McCain,     U.S. Senate.       Dear Senator McCain: The Department of Veterans Affairs      (VA) is faced with the challenge of equitably allocating more      than $16 billion in health care appropriations across a      nationwide network of hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes.      The challenge is made greater by the shifting demographics of      veterans. While nationally the veteran population is      declining, veterans have migrated from northeastern and      midwestern states to southeastern and southwestern states in      the past decade, offsetting veteran deaths in these states.       VA has historically based its allocations to facilities      primarily on their past funding levels--providing incremental      increases to facilities' past budgets. In an effort to      improve its planning, allocation, and management processes,      VA made a considerable investment in implementing a new      system, called the Resource Planning and Management (RPM)      system, for use initially in fiscal year 1994. VA considers      RPM to be a management decision process to use to formulate      its budget, allocate most of its resources, and compare      facility performance.\1\ As the basis for resource      allocation, RPM classifies each patient into a clinical care      group, calculates average facility costs per patient, and      forecasts future workload. VA envisioned that the system      would improve VA's management of limited medical care      resources, better define future resource requirements, and      enable VA to explore opportunities to improve quality and      efficiency in its health care system. This vision included      improving the equity of its allocations by more closely      linking resources with facility workloads and alleviating      inconsistencies in veterans' access to care across the      system.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \1\ Footnotes at end.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Two recent events could have significant implications for      VA's resource allocation system. First, VA is restructuring      its organization to establish 22 veterans integrated service      networks (VISN) that will replace four regional offices and      assume the individual facilities' role as the basic budgetary      and planning unit for health care delivery. The new structure      will require some change in how resources are allocated.\2\      Second, the Senate passed your proposed amendment to the      VA appropriations bill that would require VA to develop a      plan for the allocation of health care resources among its      health care facilities to ensure that veterans have the      same access to quality health care.\3\       Because of your interest in this issue, you asked us to      review the equity of VA's resource allocation system,      particularly as it related to the allocations made to the      Carl T. Hayden Medical Center in Phoeniz, Arizona. More      specifically, you asked us to determine the following:       To what extent does VA's allocation system provide for an      equitable distribution of resources among VA facilities?       What are the causes of any inequity in the distribution of      resources, and what changes, if any, would help ensure that      the system more equitably distributes resources?       In September 1995, we sent you our preliminary      observations.\4\ This report presents our final results.       To accomplish our objectives, we first needed to apply a      definition of the term ``equity.'' We based our evaluation of      the equity of the system's distribution on VA's vision for      RPM.\5\ We considered the following two elements to be      characteristics of an equitable system:       It provides comparable resources for comparable workload.       It provides resources so that veterans within the same      priority categories have the same availability of care, to      the extent practical, throughout the VA health care system.       We then reviewed VA documents and analyzed RPM system data      to determine the degree to which these two elements were      present. We discussed potential reasons for any inequities in      allocations with VA Headquarters, the Boston Development      Center, the RPM Committee, and facility officials in several      locations. To assess potential changes to address inequities,      we discussed such changes with VA officials and reviewed VA      documents on its original plans for RPM and minutes of      several RPM committees and work groups. Further details of      our scope and methodology are in appendix I. We performed our      review between December 1994 and October 1995 in accordance      with generally accepted government auditing standards.                            results in brief       The resource allocation system gives VA the ability to      identify potential inequities in resource distribution and to      forecast workload changes. Data generated by the system show      wide differences in operating costs among facilities that VA      considers comparable, even after factors such as locality      costs and patient mix differences are considered. VA's data      also show some facilities' overall patient workloads      increasing by as much as 15 percent between 1993 and 1995,      and others' workloads declining by as much as 8 percent.      However, in the two budget cycles in which RPM has been in      effect, VA used it to make only minimal changes in      facilities' funding levels--the maximum loss to any facility      was about 1 percent of its past budget and the average gain      was also about 1 percent. As such, VA's distribution of      resources has remained almost exclusively related to      incremental changes to the amount that each facility has      received in the past.       To date, VA has chosen not to use the RPM system to help      ensure resources are allocated more equitably. VA officials      indicated that larger reallocations were not made during the      first 2 years of RPM to allow facilities time to understand      the process. VA officials also cited several other reasons      that significantly larger reallocations among facilities      could not be made. Although VA is taking some actions on      these issues, it has not fully addressed concerns that (1)      facilities cannot efficiently adjust to large budget changes,      (2) VA needs a better understanding of the reasons for the      variations, and (3) resources allocated to facilities outside      the RPM process should also be considered in judging the      equity of distributions. VA's reasons for not using RPM to      even out differences in veteran access to care were less      clear as there appeared to be confusion within VA about      whether the resource allocation system was intended to      achieve this goal.                               footnotes     \1\ VA in 1995 operated 172 hospitals, 375 ambulatory      clinics, 133 nursing homes, and 39 domiciliaries. For      resource allocation purposes, RPM combines certain health      care facilities that are managerially associated. In total      the RPM system develops allocations for 167 facilities.     \2\ VA officials indicated that as part of this change, the      resource planning and management processes it used would      change and the system would be renamed. At the time of our      review, the system was known as RPM.     \3\ On September 26, 1995, the Senate adopted amendment      number 2787 to the VA appropriations bill, which was in      conference at the time of our review. If it becomes law, the      provision would require the Secretary of VA to develop a plan      for the allocation of health care resources to ensure that      veterans having similar economic status, eligibility      priority, and/or similar medical conditions have similar      access to care regardless of the region in which the veterans      reside. The plan will include, among other things, procedures      to identify reasons for variations in operating costs among      similar facilities.     \4\ See VA's Medical Resource Allocation System (GAO/HEHS-95-     252R, Sept. 12, 1995).     \5\ This vision was described in the Secretary's statements      to the Congress on RPM and in other VA publications.
