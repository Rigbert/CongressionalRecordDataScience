That's why we have had this gridlock, because you have refused to go, as you talk about the regular order, to work out an agreement between the Senate and the House. So we find ourselves where we need more time.  We have tried to provide for 6 weeks, between now and November 15, to try to work together to get to compromise and pass appropriation bills--and not in piecemeal. I don't know that I've seen an appropriation bill on a suspension before.  Mr. Speaker, this is the wrong process, it's the wrong time, and we ought to pass a CR and keep government operating for the American people.
