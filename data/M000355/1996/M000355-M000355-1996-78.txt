 Pressler and myself; an amendment by Senator Kyl regarding legal reform in Ukraine; an amendment by Senator Lieberman regarding war crimes tribunal; an amendment by Senator Pressler regarding PRC and Iran missile transfer; a Pressler amendment with reference to Syria; a McCain amendment regarding ODP; an amendment by myself relating to Korea.  For all Members of the Senate, I say that with the disposition of the amendments that we are currently aware of, we are almost completed. Other than the amendments which have been laid down, I am not aware of any other amendments upon which we will have to have votes. So we are getting close to the end of the line here.
