 President, I rise today in recognition of Mr. Harland Meredith, a resident of Tuscaloosa, a Navy hero, and a leader in our community. Over the Independence Day holiday, a friend of mine, Charlie Land, read the following tribute about Mr. Meredith. I ask that Charlie's comments be printed in the Record in celebration of Harlan Meredith.  The material follows:       Once upon a time a young man of this church, freshly      graduated from the University of Alabama, faced the world and      pondered the future. I know that doesn't sound like a big      deal. New college graduates are always doing that. No doubt      some are right now.       But this was a special time. It was May of 1941. He was 20      years old and war loomed uncertainly on the horizon.       He already had tried to get into military service through      the University's advanced Army or Army Air Corps ROTC      programs. Both had turned him down. Something always seemed      to be wrong when he took the required physical examinations,      although nothing ever showed up in his regular physicals. ``I      guess the Lord was just looking after me,'' he would muse      many years later. ``I figure He just didn't want me to be in      those.''       Within a few months, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor.      War wasn't just on the horizon anymore.       He really had always wanted to serve in the U.S. Navy,      anyhow. He applied for a direct commission as a naval officer      and was accepted. He was ready to go fight for his country,      for freedom.       But the Navy sent its new ensign to Chicago to oversee the      hydrographic office that served the Great Lakes. It was not      an unimportant job and he did it well. His commanding officer      in Detroit was pleased. He pronounced his ensign a lucky      young man; he could hydrograph his way through the whole war      right there in Chicago. He liked Chicago okay, but that      wasn't at all where he wanted to be or what he wanted to do.      He wanted to go to sea and fight. It took a while, and he had      to find his own replacement, but finally he was off to San      Francisco to train for sea duty.       Now he was 21, but he was still single, his wife-to-be yet      unmet. And he was all steamed up to go to the South Pacific.       ``You know how you are at that age,'' he says.       He got there, although in a sort of roundabout way. His      first sea duty was on the seaplane tender Hulbert, a      converted destroyer, in the Aleutian Islands off Alaska. It      was no pleasure cruise. The Aleutians were hostile waters;      Japanese forces occupied some of the islands. There was      combat, although not the heavy action to be found in the      South Pacific. One night the Hulbert dragged anchor off a      point in the Aleutians, ran aground and sank.       He transferred to a small new escort aircraft carrier based      in Portland, OR. Typical of her class, the ship was named for      a bay. Her namesake, Kalinin Bay, was in Southeast Alaska.      But she would take her new gunnery officer from Tuscaloosa to      the South Pacific at last.       And there would be some action.       The Kalinin Bay, with her 27 aircraft and 860 crew members,      sailed about the South Pacific, doing her chores. A lot of      them involved combat. There were enemy air attacks to fend      off. There was the occasional torpedo to dodge. There were      air strikes to be made. There were invasions to support-     Sapan, Guam, the Southern Palaus, islands in the Leyte Gulf      and finally the invasion of Leyte itself as Gen. Douglas      MacArthur made good on his promise to return to the      Philippines.       So the Kalinin Bay was no stranger to combat as she steamed      some 60 miles east of the Philippine Island of Samar early on      the morning of October 25, 1944. She already had operated off      Leyte for more than a week. Her planes already had flown 244      sorties, destroying enemy installations and airfields on five      different islands.       She was part of a small naval battle group nicknamed      ``Taffy 3.'' It included 5 other escort carriers, plus a      screen of 3 destroyers and 4 destroyer escorts. The carriers      of ``Taffy 3'' were preparing to launch their first air      strikes of the day when its commanding admiral learned that a      sizable Japanese naval force was approaching. It was 0647      hours.       By 0658 hours, ``Taffy 3'' was under fire from part of the      largest Japanese surface fleet to fight since the Battle of      Midway, coming to keep the Americans out of the Philippines.       The ``Battle Off Samar'', as it would be called, was under      way. It would be described by historians as one of the most      memorable engagements in U.S. naval history.       The ships of ``Taffy 3'', slower, outnumbered and      outgunned, soon were fighting for their lives against a force      of four Japanese battleships, eight cruisers and 12      destroyers. The Kalinin Bay took the first of 15 direct hits      at 0750 hours, a 14- or 16-inch shell from one of the      battleships. It struck one side of the hangar deck near the      forward elevator. A later hit penetrated the deck and      destroyed all of the ship's radio and radar equipment.       Fortunately, some of the shells went right through the ship      without causing significant damage. And even more      fortunately, there were a great many near misses. The Kalinin      Bay fought back hard. She launched her aircraft while under      fire from three cruisers. She dodged behind a timely rain      squall, then maneuvered behind chemical smoke. She traded      fire with the cruisers for a while, then shot it out with      Japan's Destroyer Squadron 10.       Her 5-inch gun stayed busy. It scored two hits on one heavy      cruiser and hit a Japanese destroyer amidships. And her      planes inflicted heavy damage, striking the enemy ships      with bombs, rockets and gunfire.       The Japanese naval vessels turned away for ``Taffy 3''      after 2\1/2\ hours, but not before their destroyers launched      a torpedo attack. The torpedoes were launched from far enough      away to begin to slow before reaching their targets. So a      U.S. Avenger torpedo-     bomber from a sister ship was able to explode two torpedoes      in the Kalinin Bay's wake about 100 yards astern, and the      ship's 5-inch gun deflected another from a collision course      with her stern.       Battered and bloody, the U.S. force sailed south, but there      still would be little respite for the Kalinin Bay and her      surviving sister ships. Little more than an hour later, at      1050, they cam under concentrated attack from kamikzae      aircraft, the suicide bombers of World War II. Four kamikazes      dived at the Kalinin Bay. Two of the airplanes were shot down      at close range. The third crashed into one side of the flight      deck, damaging it badly. The fourth destroyed the aft port      stack.       It was finally over by 1130 hours. The ships and planes of      ``Taffy 3,'' with some help from the planes of another unit,      ``Taffy 2'', had cleared the air of enemy planes and had      denied the powerful Japanese force entry into the Gulf of      Leyte.       MacArthur's beachhead was safe.       The price had been high. Five of ``Taffy 3's'' 13 ships had      been sunk--two carriers, a destroyer and two destroyer      escorts. Hundreds of American sailors had died. The Kalinin      Bay counted five dead among her 60 casualties, plus      considerable structural damage.       During the hours of intense, furious fighting, the gunnery      officer of the Kalinin Bay never wished he was back in that      office in Chicago.       The Kalinin Bay managed to make it to New Guinea for      temporary repairs. The ship was back in the States by late      November and he transferred off as it awaited further work.      Shipmates had died in several battles. He had been frightened      at times and his faith in God had been tested. But he had      come through without a scratch and with his faith stronger      than ever.       ``You realized your Christian faith was the most important      thing you could have,'' he would say. ``In combat I felt like      I was sent there for a purpose. I felt like God's hand was      holding me the whole time; I really did.''       He was ready for his next assignment.       It was to the Midway, a much larger aircraft carrier that      soon was to be commissioned at Newport News, VA. The idea was      for the Midway to sail around the Horn and into the Pacific,      where it would be a powerful additional force. By the time      the Midway was commissioned September 10, 1945, that      assignment was unnecessary. Gen. MacArthur had accepted      Japan's unconditional surrender on September 2 aboard the      Battleship Missouri in Tokyo Bay. The war was over.       The Midway would have a lasting impact on his life, though.      A fellow naval officer needed tickets to the commissioning      ceremony for house guests, and he was glad to oblige. Among      the guests he met the lovely young woman from Tuscaloosa who      would become his wife.       They married shortly after he got out of the Navy. Duty      done and a bit older, the young man who had loved his country      so much that he was determined to fight for it turned his      attention to a successful business career; helped raise two      beautiful daughters, and became a highly respected community      leader.       He became a stalwart of this church, a wise, practical      leader who has given of himself, grown and thrived on his      ability to seek and receive more insights. His faith has been      unwavering, even during the painful ordeal of one daughter's      untimely death.       People who know him will tell you he is a man of high      intelligence, great character, impeccable integrity, calm      consistency and complete credibility. They will also tell you      he hard-working, caring, considerate, loyal and a Southern      gentleman in the best sense of that definition.       He's a man who still greatly loves his family and his      hometown and the United States of America and what it stands      for, what he fought for.       A patriot.       A man who reminds us in his modest, unassuming way that      patriotism isn't some mysterious, exotic condition. It is      simple and fundamental and powerful. It springs from fervent      love for your country, love for freedom. It is in your heart      and spirit and actions, just like it always has been in his.       This sanctuary hasn't lacked for patriots and heroes to sit      in its pews to worship God over the decades. Many who fit      that description are here today, as you are most Sundays.       I salute you. And I salute Harlan Meredith, who story I'm      sure some of you recognized. I also thank him for his      graciousness in sharing it with me, at my request, so I could      share it with you today.       Incidentally, Harlan and Mary Anne have been married for 57      years now. That's worth a salute, too. Our church, community      and country has been blessed to have people like Harlan, and      you.       This, too, is a special time in our country's history.      Again we are at war. Almost every day more of our soldiers      pay the ultimate price for our country, leaving saddened      survivors to live with the aftermath. It makes this      Independence Day weekend all the more meaningful. I pray it      also makes us all the more thankful for our blessings.       And the United States of America truly has been blessed      these 227 years, perhaps most of all with the courageous,      hard-working, God-loving people who have built and maintained      this great country of liberty and justice. People who have      been willing to sacrifice and fight for it, as so many      continue to do today. Patriots.       We aren't perfect as a country. But to the extent mere      humankind can be, the good part of the United States of      America is both the light and the hope of the world. May God      bless you; may God continue to bless America; and may we      never forget from Whom our blessings flow.       I don't think Harlan Meredith ever has.                          ____________________
