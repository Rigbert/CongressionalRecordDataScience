President, this week, the Nation commemorates the 49th anniversary of ``Bloody Sunday,'' a day which marked a crucial turning point in securing the right to vote for all Americans. On March 7, 1965, in Selma, Alabama, John Lewis and his fellow civil rights activists marched for their right to vote but were brutally attacked by state troopers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. We remember the acts of courageous Americans who fought through the years for equality. We honor their legacy by reaffirming our commitment to protect the right to vote for all Americans.  On the week of this important anniversary, I am pleased to join Sen. Whitehouse in introducing the Caging Prohibition Act of 2009. This legislation contains commonsense reforms to strengthen the Nation's ability to combat organized efforts to suppress the right to vote and better protect the voting rights of countless Americans.  Senator Whitehouse and I introduced a similar bill two years ago in an effort to bring urgent election reform to protect voters during the 2008 presidential election. Although the Rules Committee held a hearing on the measure, the bill was not reported out of Committee before the Senate adjourned last year. I hope the Senate will do its part to prevent shenanigans from disenfranchising voters during the next Federal election, by promptly passing this bill.  During my three decades in the Senate, I have devoted a considerable portion of my work to improving democratic participation and make our government more accessible to all Americans. For the past two years, I have been delighted to have Senator Whitehouse as a partner on this important issue. I thank him for his leadership on preserving and strengthening our voting rights.  In recent years, we have seen a surge in a particularly alarming form of voter suppression known as voter caging. In voter caging, a political organization sends mail to addresses on voter rolls, compiles a list of returned mail, and uses that list as grounds for partisan and unjustified purges or challenges of voters' eligibility. During the last two presidential election cycles, we have seen evidence of voter caging efforts emerge in numerous States, including Ohio, Florida, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.  Chief among the problems with voter caging is that it threatens to disenfranchise voters in an unreliable manner. Rather than preventing votes cast by ineligible voters, far too often the practice prevents legitimate voters from casting their ballots. According to a recent report from the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice, ``[V]oter caging lists are highly likely to include the names of many voters who are in fact eligible to vote.'' Of course, since government databases are often riddled with typos and clerical errors, these findings are hardly surprising.  Even more troubling, voter caging often aims to disenfranchise minority voters. I recall during a Senate race in Louisiana, in 1986, a memorandum from the Republican National Committee concluded that hiring a consultant to distribute 350,000 mailings marked ``do not forward'' to mostly African-American districts would ``eliminate at least 60-80,000 folks from the rolls . . . [and] could keep the black vote down considerably.'' That is unacceptable. That is wrong. No one's right to vote should be abridged, suppressed, or denied in the United States of America.  The practice of voter caging chips away at core protections in our democracy. The right to vote, and have your vote count, is a foundational right because it secures the effectiveness of all other protections. Indeed, the very legitimacy of our government is dependent on the access all Americans have to the political process. That is why voting is the cornerstone of our democracy. Any infringement on this right harms the fabric of America.  All too often, voter caging efforts have partisan goals. For example, the Judiciary Committee's investigation last Congress into the mass firings of U.S. Attorneys for political reasons shed light on how Tim Griffin, a former Bush White House aide, participated in a voter caging scheme aimed at disenfranchising African-American voters in Florida. He was later appointed interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas.  Rooting out partisan voter caging tactics requires us to give Federal officials the tools and resources they need to investigate and prosecute organized efforts to suppress the right to vote. This bill will do exactly that.  This legislation would prohibit challenging a person's eligibility to vote--or register to vote--based on a voter caging list, an unverified match list, or foreclosure status. A challenged voter may feel intimidated or discouraged, and may leave a polling site and not vote. In America, a person should not lose their fundamental right to vote, nor have that vote challenged, on the sole basis of a mistake, error, or because their mail failed to reach them. Similarly, as the current economic crisis reminds us, Americans should not have their fundamental right to vote jeopardized simply because they lose their jobs to layoffs or their homes to foreclosure.  The bill would also require any private party who challenges the right of another citizen to vote--or register to vote--to set forth in writing, under penalty of perjury, the specific grounds for the alleged ineligibility. This provision deters illegitimate challenges to voters by requiring, at a minimum, a showing of good cause. It properly balances legitimate efforts to clean voting rolls with forbidding unreliable voter purges.  I am pleased that this bill has the support of civil rights and voting rights organizations such as the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the Lawyers Community for Civil Rights under Law, the Brennan Center for Justice, and the People for the American Way. They understand that voter caging is a modern-day barrier to the ballot box that has created unique problems for legitimate voters for many years, and that a Federal ban on these undemocratic practices is necessary.  I hope that this year all Senators will support this important legislation and take firm action to stamp out this intolerable voter suppression tactic.                                 ______                                       By
