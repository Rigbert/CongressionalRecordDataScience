President, we have been assured by the House in the construction of this bill that this provision was added explicitly to make certain that there be no question that the grants that are given to these organizations would be authorized and included in this appropriations process. That is their belief. With an abundance of caution, we support their belief because we know of the importance of these organizations.  I now move to table the McCain amendment No. 33, and I ask for the yeas and nays.
