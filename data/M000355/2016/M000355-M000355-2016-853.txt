 President, reserving the right to object.  As I indicated a moment ago, the way to measure a President's success in getting judges confirmed is to compare two Presidencies--President Bush, who was in office for 8 years, and President Obama, who will be in office for 8 years--to this point. At this point, President Obama has received 21 more judicial confirmations than President Bush did to this point. So he has been treated very fairly.
