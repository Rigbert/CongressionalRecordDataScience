The historic return of the swallows to San Juan Capistrano is celebrated each spring as the world focuses on this wonder of nature. This year, March 29, 2008, commemorates the 50th annual celebration of the Swallows' Day Parade in Orange County, California in the beautiful City of San Juan Capistrano.  Orange County's oldest city, historic San Juan Capistrano is home to the Mission San Juan Capistrano. The mission was founded more than 200 years ago in 1776 as the seventh of 21 California missions to serve as the center of the community, and stands today as a monument to the rich cultural history of southern California. The Mission San Juan Capistrano is believed to be the oldest church in California, and is one of only two standing chapels still in use where Father Junipero Serra is known to have celebrated mass.  The migration of the swallows of Capistrano has become a symbol for nature's changing of the seasons and welcoming of spring. The cliff swallows, upon their arrival begin building their nests under the eaves and ruins of the old stone mission and other buildings throughout the Capistrano Valley. The location has remained an ideal nesting place for the swallows because the area provides an abundance of insects on which they feed.  The species of cliff swallow, Petrochelidon pyrrhonota, a small, long-winged songbird, leaves Goya, Argentina at daylight around the 18th of February, arriving in Capistrano about the 19th of March. This 30-day journey covers nearly 7,500 miles, as the swallows continue through the Gulf of Mexico along Central America to the Yucatan Peninsula, turn west to the Pacific, fly over Baja California until they arrive in San Juan Capistrano and the agricultural valleys of southern California.  Each year on St. Joseph's Day, March 19th, the Fiesta de las Golondrinas celebrates the legendary return of the swallows to the Mission San Juan Capistrano. In 1936, the Fiesta de las Golondrinas was first celebrated when a popular radio host broadcasted from the mission to announce the return of the swallows. The Swallows' Day Parade during the Fiesta de las Golondrinas continues today as an integral part of the festivities, and is recognized as the largest nonmotorized parade in the country.  I take this opportunity to honor the historic city of San Juan Capistrano, as well as the tireless efforts of the San Juan Capistrano Fiesta Association and the overwhelming support of the community in southern Orange County, California. I ask you to join me in celebrating the return of the swallows to San Juan Capistrano and the rich cultural heritage of the 50th annual Swallows' Day Parade.                          ____________________
