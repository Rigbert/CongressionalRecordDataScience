Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Bonilla) for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Royce amendment. I think that the proof is in the pudding, and the pudding is in the trade accounts of the United States, which show that in spite of an unbelievably large trade deficit in almost every other sector, in the agricultural arena we have been able to keep our nose above water barely, because we have exported more than we have imported. With dropping prices for product and so forth, we have managed to double some exports. In specialty areas, whether we are talking about fish or packaged juices, we have been able to keep moving product outside this country. That takes effort. The Market Access Program helps.  With changes made in prior farm bills, we have limited those who can apply for assistance in order to move product into the international market; but my goodness I would not want to stand on this floor and oppose a program that has helped America maintain positive trade accounts in agriculture internationally when every other single account in petroleum and imported oil products, in manufactured goods, in electrical equipment, no matter where one goes in the trade accounts, the United States has historic trade deficits but for agriculture. Though the going is getting rougher in international waters in terms of trade, my goodness, this would be the last program one would want to eliminate in terms of helping both farmers in this country move product and in maintaining and turning around that yawning trade deficit which is a very serious underbelly inside this economy. So I rise in opposition to the Royce amendment.
