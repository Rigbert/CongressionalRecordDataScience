President, Lubec, ME, is the easternmost town in the United States, the place where the rising Sun first shines on America. That unique geographic location has special meaning in this, Lubec's bicentennial year. Today, as they have for two centuries, the people of Lubec greet every day with the optimism and determination each dawn brings.  Located on a slender peninsula that separates Passamaquoddy Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, Lubec is more than a town on the sea. It is a town of the sea. Its 95 miles of shoreline once were lined with cargo-filled docks, shipyards, sail makers, canneries, smokehouses, and tide-powered sawmills. Its namesake, Lubeck, Germany, was chosen to emulate that ancient seafaring city's role as a center of open and free trade. The magnificent sea captain homes throughout the town stand as monuments to Lubec's role as an early hub of America's global commerce.  Now, it is a shoreline of aquaculture pens, lobster traps, and urchin and scallop boats. For those seeking a genuine downeast Maine experience, theformer ``Sardine Capital of the World'' has become an outdoor recreation paradise, an ecotourism destination, and a haven for artists. The West Quoddy Lighthouse, with its iconic red and white stripes, is recognized the world over. The Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Bridge, the link to Campobello Island, New Brunswick, gives Lubec an international flavor.  The town of Lubec was incorporated on June 21, 1811, but its origins lie in prehistory. For 12,000 years before the first European settlers arrived, the land was home to the Passamaquoddy Tribe, and the original ``People of the Dawn'' still are part of the community today.  Lubec is a town of the first light and of the first patriots. One early settler was Colonel John Allan who in 1777 was charged by General George Washington with defending the remote yet vital region. He repelled a British amphibious invasion and forged an alliance for liberty with the Passamaquoddy, Penobscot, and Micmac tribes. Another early resident was Hopley Yeaton, who served in the Continental Navy. In 1790, he was appointed by President George Washington as the first commissioned officer in our young Nation's maritime security and safety service--he is known today as the ``Father of the United States Coast Guard.''  During the War of 1812, Lubec stood strong against a British occupation just 2 miles across the bay. In the Civil War, 200 young men--one-eighth of the town's entire population--answered the call of freedom. Lubec's commitment reaches from the front lines to the home front--during World War II, the workers at the R.J. Peacock Canning Company received a special citation from the War Food Department for their untiring efforts and patriotic service.  And the town has found itself on the front lines in the conflicts of our time. On September 11, 2001, Jackie and Robert Norton were flying to California for a family wedding. They perished at the World Trade Center. The people of Lubec will always remember those dear neighbors who, from their beautiful gardens to their community service, gave so much to the town.  The spirit of Lubec is exemplified in the life of Myron Avery. From the tiny North Lubec Grammar School and the village high school, he went on to Bowdoin College and Harvard Law School to become a jurist of national renown. He served our Nation in both world wars as a Navy officer. In between, he turned the vision of the Appalachian Trail into reality and was the first to hike its entire 2,000 miles in one effort, from Georgia to Maine. Commitment to service, reverence for nature, and building for the future--that is the spirit of Lubec.  On this Fourth of July, Lubec, ME, will hold its Grand Bicentenary Jubilee. It will be a day of great food, music, and fun. It will be a day for the people of this wonderful town to look back at the past two centuries with pride, and to look ahead at the century to come with optimism and determination.                          ____________________
