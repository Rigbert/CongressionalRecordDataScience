I find it baffling that instead of talking about jobs, my friends on the other side of the aisle continue a path toward radically changing 20 percent of our economy. Small businesses continue to struggle, but rather than creating an environment that eases financial burdens on business, the administration and this Congress are creating uncertainty through health care takeovers, cap-and-tax, deficit spending, looming tax increases. A recent analysis of the current health care bill shows that it could cost America 1 million jobs by the end of this decade. That is unacceptable.  I recently polled my constituents. Two-thirds are absolutely opposed to the health care bill. They want Congress to start over and focus on items we agree on. Let's return to the question of how we can make health care more accessible, more efficient, and less expensive. Let's kill this bill and save American freedom and our economy.                          ____________________
