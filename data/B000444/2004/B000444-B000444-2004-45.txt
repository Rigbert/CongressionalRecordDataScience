 President, today marks the 10-year anniversary of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. The bill, which was the product of bi-partisan compromise, took a balanced position to criminal justice policy, strengthening many Federal penalties, providing funding to build prisons and promoting truth-in-sentencing. Most importantly, the act made important investments in programs designed to prevent crime in the first place, including putting 100,000 community policing officers on the street and reducing violence against women and children.  To ensure this bill's passage, I worked harder than I ever had in the U.S. Senate. Prior to the final vote, in August of 1994, I stated that ``I will vote for this bill, because, as much as anything I have ever voted on in 22 years in the U.S. Senate, I truly believe that passage of this legislation will make a difference in the lives of the American people. I believe with every fiber in my being that if this bill passes, fewer people will be murdered, fewer people will be victims, fewer women will be senselessly beaten, fewer people will continue on the drug path, and fewer children will become criminals.''  Fortunately, this turned out to be right. With the passage of the Biden crime bill we were able to form a partnership amongst Federal, State, and local law enforcement and create programs that helped drive down crime rates for 8 consecutive years. In 1994 we had historically high rates of violent crimes, such as murders, forcible rapes, and aggravated assaults. We were able to reduce these to the lowest levels in a generation. We reduced the murder rate by 37.8 percent; we reduced forcible rapes by 19.1 percent; and we reduced aggravated assaults by 25.5 percent. Property crimes, including auto thefts, also were reduced from historical highs to the lowest levels in decades.  How were we able to achieve such great results? Well, we all know it was a combination of factors, but most law enforcement officials credit the Office of Community Oriented Policing with a pivotal role. Indeed, in the words of Attorney General Ashcroft, the Community Oriented Policing program has been ``a miraculous success.'' COPS has funded over 118,000 local officers to patrol our neighborhoods and towns and help drive down crime rates. Because of COPS, the concept of community policing has spread to cities and towns across the country.  A testament to the success of the program is the fact that it has been endorsed by every major law enforcement group in the country, including the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), the National Association of Police Organizations, the National Sheriff's Association, the International Brotherhood of Police Organizations, the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Officials, the International Union of Police Associations, the Fraternal Order of Police, and others.  Completely disregarding the overwhelming success of COPS, the Bush administration and Republican leadership have set their sights on eliminating this program. President Bush has proposed cuts each year he has been in office, and while we have fought to maintain funding for COPS, we are fighting an uphill battle. Funding for 5 State and local law enforcement programs run out of the Department of Justice is down 75.6 percent since fiscal year 2002. To me, this approach is inexplicable, particularly because the need for Federal assistance remains pressing.  Recent articles from USA Today and the New York Times highlighted the fact that many cities are being forced to eliminate officers because of their woeful local budgets. In fact, New York City has lot 3,000 officers in the last few years. Other cities, such as Cleveland, OH, Milwaukee, MN, and Houston, TX, are facing similar shortages. As a result, local police chiefs are reluctantly pulling officers from the proactive policing activities that were so successful in the nineties. This has not been a choice taken lightly. Police chiefs understand the value of proactive policing; however, they simply don't have the manpower to do it all. Basically, we have been asking them to do more with less, and responding to emergency calls must take precedence over proactive programs. However, I fear that we are starting to see the results. Local chiefs are reporting increased gang activity. Murder rates and auto thefts--two very accurate indicators of crime trends--have gone up for 3 consecutive years.  The Bush administration's response to these criticisms is that funding for first responders is way up. Undoubtedly, these are critical, necessary expenditures, and I believe that the administration has not invested enough for our first responders. However, this argument misses the point entirely. We have an obligation to do both. We must fund our first responders and invest in the programs that help reduce traditional crime and prevent terrorism. As the President has stated on many occasions, it is the solemn duty of the Federal Government to keep Americans safe. We simply can't achieve this goal without investing in our State and local law enforcement partners. The COPS office has been a critical lynchpin in the Federal, State, and local partnership that has been effective since the passage of the 1994 Biden crime bill, and I hope that the Bush administration and this Congress will reverse its current course and provide critical funding for this program.  Another component of the 1994 Biden crime bill was the Violence Against Women Act. With the passage of the Violence Against Women Act we started talking about that dirty little secret that no one wanted to say out loud, and as a result women and children have become safer. Instead of suffering alone, a rape victim or battered wife can now turn to a trained police officer, an emergency room nurse, or a 1-800 telephone operator. We've transformed so-called ``family matters'' into public crimes that hold the offender accountable and provide the victim with meaningful services.  Since fiscal year 1995, nearly $3.8 billion has been appropriated for the programs created by the Violence Against Women Act. In Delaware alone, the Office on Violence Against Women has overseen 21 grant awards totaling $9.5 million. These investments have paid off. Domestic violence has dropped nearly 50 percent. Incidents of rape are down by 60 percent. The number of women killed by an abusive husband or boyfriend is down 22 percent. Today, more than half of all rape victims are stepping forward to report the crime, and over a million women have found justice in our courtrooms and obtained domestic violence protection orders.  Of course, we need to do more. As more and more brave women step forward to report a rape or seek a restraining order, more demands are placed on women's shelters, State prosecutors, victim advocates, and other resources. As we encourage victim reporting and swift responses by our criminal justice system, we must continue to create and support services for families in distress. We cannot let the Violence Against Women Act become a victim of its own success.  To ensure that VAWA is passed on to the next generation, we have begunworking on the next version of the act. This is a collaborative effort. We are listening closely to those on the front lines--police, trial judges, emergency room nurses and many others--and making targeted improvements to existing grant programs and tightening up criminal laws. We are learning about the new challenges and the persistent problems of old. Frankly, there are still far too many women and their children vulnerable to cowardly abusers. As such, the new act may include heightened penalties for repeat Federal domestic violence offenders, and update the Federal stalking statute to incorporate new technologies that can terrorize women.  This past spring, I was in my home State at an event honoring the winners of our high school poster contest. To enter this first-ever ``Teens Against Sexual Assault'' contest, any Delaware high school student could submit a poster that somehow visually depicted the message ``no means no.'' The two young winners were quite shy, but they both joined me at the podium in front of 200 people. They stunned the audience, admitting that they both had been victims of rape and hoped that through their efforts they could help other young women find the courage to report their attacker and seek help. As I listened to these courageous young women, I was reminded of the essential purpose of the Violence Against Women Act. We simply can't stop now.  Prior to the enactment of the 1994 crime bill, many doubted that the Federal Government could have a measurable impact on crime in the United States. Programs such as COPS and VAWA proved the critics wrong. COPS and VAWA have made Americans safer and changed fundamental societal attitudes about domestic violence and sexual assault.  In this new age of terrorism, we simply cannot lose site of traditional crimes in our neighborhoods and homes. While the threat of terrorism is very real, the likelihood of becoming a victim of a ``traditional'' crime is exponentially far greater than becoming a victim of a terrorist attack. Last year, there were over one million incidents of violent crime and over 16,000 murders reported to the police. If we are going to continue to progress and make this country safer, we must continue to invest in the programs that have proven successful, and during the last few weeks of this legislative session, I hope Congress and President Bush will do just that.                          ____________________
