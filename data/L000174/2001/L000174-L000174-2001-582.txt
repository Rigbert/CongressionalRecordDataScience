President, I was not aware of the funeral.  Perhaps this is a plea the Senator from Utah would join; that if other Senators from both sides have amendments that are available, we urge them to get down here. The Senator from Utah and I will work to the extent that people are here, probably go back and forth with amendments and start voting soon.  On our side of the aisle, I urge all Democrats who have amendments to get to the floor, show them to the Republican side and this side, and start moving on amendments.
