President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2157         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives      of the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Drug-Price Transparency in      Communications Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds as follows:         (1) Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription      pharmaceuticals is legal in only 2 developed countries, the      United States and New Zealand.         (2) Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription      pharmaceuticals is designed to cause patients to pressure      physicians to prescribe certain medications.         (3) In 2015, pharmaceutical companies spent more than      $100,000,000 on advertising with respect to each of 16 brand-     name drugs, primarily new and expensive drugs.         (4) Prescription rates of medications advertised directly      to consumers have increased by 34.2 percent compared to a 5.1      percent increase in other pharmaceuticals.         (5) Prescription pharmaceuticals cost more in the United      States than they do in any other country.         (6) The American Medical Association has passed      resolutions calling for the ban of direct-to-consumer      advertising of prescription pharmaceuticals, and to require      price transparency in any direct-to-consumer advertising.         (7) The amount of spending by pharmaceutical companies in      marketing to health care providers is more than 4 times the      spending for direct-to-consumer advertising.         (8) Health care providers are more likely to prescribe a      certain drug if they have received payments or marketing      materials from the manufacturer of that drug.     SEC. 3.

For purposes of this      subparagraph, all violations under this paragraph occurring      in a single day shall be considered one violation. With      respect to advertisements that appear in magazines or other      publications that are published less frequently than daily,      each issue date (whether weekly or monthly) shall be treated      as a single day for the purpose of calculating the number of      violations under this subparagraph.''.
