President, first, I thank the distinguished Senator from California. She has talked about the daunting hours the senior Senator from Pennsylvania has put in on this legislation, as well as those of us who have been concerned with it.  I note the Senator from California has spent those hours with us. She has been there, her staff has been there--I don't know how many times I have received calls that start with: Patrick, I have been thinking about this--and off we go. Usually, that is about points to which I should be paying more attention. All of that has gone toward a better bill.  The senior Senator from Pennsylvania is not on the floor looking for praise, but I am going to take a moment to praise him from this side of the aisle. I do not know a single Senator, Republican or Democrat, who came to him and said: I want to talk to you about this, who was not given a fair, thorough hearing. If they had a better way of doing it, the Senator from Pennsylvania would say: Let's consider it. He and I would talk about it, and if we were convinced it was a better way, it became part of the bill.  I have been here 31 years, as I am sometimes wont to say. My children remind me they had forgotten I was that old. But I have been here 31 years, and I very rarely have seen a chairman of either party take that much time and effort to accommodate every single Senator. I applaud my friend from Pennsylvania for doing that.  But the proof comes in the pudding. Because he did do that, we have an even better bill than when we started. We spent several years on this. I recall conducting one of the first hearings on this several years ago. We have done this through two different Congresses. We have had numerous markups, and we have come out with a better bill. It is on the floor now because it is the aggregate of great ideas.  This is why the point of order is so frustrating, the point of order that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said they would not expect this legislation to add to the Federal debt. Yet we still have to face this point of order because the point of order has become for many a backdoor way of killing this bill. If it is done to kill the bill, Senators should ask themselves what they are then faced with? I will tell you what they are faced with. They are faced with thousands upon thousands of victims--and we are all for the victims. Lord knows everybody said that. But if you vote to sustain this point of order what you are telling thousands upon thousands of victims is: You are on your own. You probably have no chance of getting the recovery you would have here.  Certainly, you tell all those veterans who have no place of recovery that they are gone. That is why every single veterans group I can think of has endorsed the legislation, the Specter-Leahy legislation. They have endorsed it. That is why all those veterans organizations said: Don't vote to sustain this point of order.  I have a great deal of respect for the Senate Budget Committee. Certainly, I do for my friend, the ranking member, and my friend the chairman. But I disagree with any position that says this legislation would add to our deficit. If you fully read the text of our legislation and the testimony of the Congressional Budget Office and the recent analysis of the fiscal impact of this legislation, it does not support the point of order. We have heard people who are opposed to this say that somehow a privately funded trust will add to the Federal debt. This week, the Congressional Budget Office made it very clear that the trust fund set up under this bill does not add to the Federal debt. CBO stated in its letter that ``the legislation would be deficit neutral over the life of the fund.''  I ask unanimous consent that that letter from CBO be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Congress,                                  Congressional Budget Office,                                Washington, DC, February 13, 2006.     Hon. Arlen Specter,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: At the request of the Committee on the      Budget, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has reviewed      Senate Amendment No. 2746 to S. 852, the Fairness in Asbestos      Injury Resolution (FAIR) Act of 2005, a substitute amendment      that was printed in the Congressional Record on February 9,      2006. This review addresses the amendment's year-by-year      budgetary impact over the first 10 years, its aggregate      impact in succeeding 10-year periods, and its cumulative      budgetary impact over the life of the proposed Asbestos      Injury Claims Resolution Fund (Asbestos Fund). It also      addresses the potential costs of intergovernmental and      private-sector mandates in the legislation.                            Budgetary Impact       Assuming that the bill as amended is enacted before the end      of 2006, and based on the assumptions underlying our August      2005 cost estimate for S. 852, CBO estimates that payments to      eligible claimants, start-up costs, investment transactions,      and administrative expenses of the Asbestos Fund would total      about $64 billion over the 2006-2015 period (excluding debt-     service costs). Those sums would appear in the federal budget      as direct spending (see the table below). Over the same 10-     year period, we estimate that the fund would collect about      $58 billion from firms and insurance companies with past      asbestos liability and from certain private asbestos trust      funds. CBO expects that those sums would be treated in the      budget as federal revenues. In addition, the Joint Committee      on Taxation (JCT) estimates that enactment of the legislation      would lead to a reduction of about $1.1 billion in receipts      from corporate income taxes over the 2007-2015 period; this      would affect the budget totals but would not affect the      balances of the Asbestos Fund. Thus, CBO estimates federal      revenues would increase by about $57 billion over the next 10      years under the bill.

CBO's estimate of spending from the Asbestos Fund over the      2006-2015 period differs from that in CBO's August 2005 cost      estimate for S. 852 because we now assume a later enactment      date for the legislation. In addition, certain provisions in      section 402 regarding when assets would be transferred from      private asbestos bankruptcy trust funds to the proposed      federal Asbestos Fund would slightly reduce both spending and      revenues, relative to the amounts shown in the earlier cost      estimate. CBO estimates that other provisions of the      amendment would not significantly affect spending or receipts      over the 10-year period, relative to the amounts shown in      CBO's earlier estimate.       The revenue effects shown in the table also incorporate a      change in CBO's cost estimate unrelated to the amendment.      That change involves effects of the legislation on the      amounts that insurers and defendant firms would deduct to      arrive at taxable corporate income. In CBO's earlier      estimate, it was judged that the amounts deducted as payments      made over the life of the trust fund were approximately the      same as would be deducted to cover claims under the current      tort compensation system, producing no net effects on      corporate income tax collections over the life of the fund.       This assessment has not changed. But while total deductions      over the life of the trust fund would not change, their      distribution over those years could. Larger deductions up      front, as a result of S. 852, could produce less revenue from      corporate income taxes in the earlier years, which would be      offset by a revenue gain in later years. Lacking any basis      for estimating this timing effect, CBO elected not to      incorporate it into its cost estimate. Recently, the Joint      Committee on Taxation produced an estimate of this timing      effect. In its estimation, receipts from corporate income      taxes would be reduced by about $1.1 billion over the 2007-     2015 period. CBO has elected to incorporate JCT's estimate of      this effect in its projections. That adjustment does not      affect spending or receipts of the proposed Asbestos Fund.       CBO also estimates that, so long as the fund's      administrator does not borrow amounts beyond the means of the      fund to repay (as the bill would require), the government's      general funds would not be used to pay asbestos claims.      Furthermore, section 406 of the bill states that the      legislation would not obligate the federal government to pay      any part of an award under the bill if amounts in the      asbestos fund are inadequate. Thus, CBO concludes that the      legislation would be deficit-neutral over the life of the      fund.       Substantial payments from the fund would continue well      after 2015. Consequently, pursuant to section 407 of H. Con.      Res. 95 (the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget, Fiscal Year      2006), CBO estimates that enacting the bill as amended would      cause an increase in net direct spending greater than $5      billion in at least one of the 10-year periods from 2016 to      2055.                                Mandates       The proposed amendment contains the same intergovernmental      and private-sector mandates as the reported bill. It would      preempt state laws relating to asbestos claims and prevent      state courts from ruling on those cases. It also would      require state governments to comply with requests for      information from the Asbestos Insurers Commission. CBO      estimates that any cost associated with those      intergovernmental mandates would be insignificant and well      below the threshold--$64 million in 2006, adjusted annually      for inflation--established in the Unfunded Mandates Reform      Act (UMRA).       The proposed amendment would also impose mandates on      certain individuals filing claims for compensation for      injuries caused by exposure to asbestos; certain companies      with prior expenditures related to asbestos personal injury      claims; certain insurance companies; trusts established to      provide compensation for asbestos claims; health insurers;      and persons involved in manufacturing, processing, or selling      certain products containing asbestos. Based on information      from academic, industry, government, and other sources, CBO      concludes that the aggregate direct cost to the private      sector of complying with all of the mandates in the bill      would well exceed the annual threshold established by UMRA      ($128 million in 2006, adjusted annually for inflation).       If you wish further details on this estimate, we would be      pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Mike      Waters, who may be reached at 226-2860.
