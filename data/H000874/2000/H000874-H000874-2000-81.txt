Speaker, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe) and I are not managing this conference report, as was noted. In fact, it is being managed by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young). That is a testimony to the process, the convoluted process, that has brought us to this floor today.  The gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Pastor) rose and said that this was never considered in the legislative bill to be added. As far as I know, it was never considered in the legislative conference, not the conference that I participated in. At no time did the legislative conference meet and add this as a part of its bill.  I am on the legislative committee, at least as far as I was invited to. I do not know whether the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) was invited to a conference of the legislative committee or the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Pastor), but I think the answer to that is no.  Notwithstanding that, I and the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe) have tried to work together to try to bring this bill to a point where we could all support it. Very frankly, I think that that is possible. I think it is still possible.  I talked to the Speaker about it just an hour and a half ago. I am sorry that we are here today in a mode of not being in agreement on this bill.  So, first of all, the process has been very convoluted. The Senate, of course, has not considered this bill on the floor and there was no real conference on a Senate bill and a House bill and the differences.  This process, from the very beginning, has been a difficult one, if not incorrect one. In the committee's report when we came to the floor on this bill, the committee said we needed $1.3 billion more, I think they were correct, at least $1.3 billion more, to meet the responsibilities of our committee and of the agencies that we fund.  That was the majority's observation, not mine. But they brought a bill to the floor which was $464 million low on IRS. I am going to talk about that in a second. It ended up being more than that because we cut $25 million on the floor to add to HIDTAs. So it was $491 million low on IRS when it left this House.  Now, we did not have convened a conference in the sense that we had two bills. There were meetings. That is correct. There were invitations to come to meetings, some of which were attended. The final conference or whatever conference occurred, I was not at. The perception of the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe) is that is by choice. I think that is from his standpoint. I understand that perception. But it was also a choice that was made in the context that we really did not know what was going on, and there were no discussions with us as to exactly what was to be added. The gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe) represents there were discussions with the White House. The White House is not for these numbers in this bill, still thinks they are substantially low, as I think the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe) knows.  Now, the legislation bill comes back to us $1.2 billion over what the House passed, mostly Republicans but some Democrats as well.  That $1.2 billion was added essentially without participation of a full conference. That should not happen. There were an additional $18.8 million that included projects and priorities of various Members, none of whom were Democrats on this side of the aisle. That should not happen.  Let us deal now with the IRS within the time frame that we have, because that is really the most important issue that we deal with in this bill. It is, after all, the agency that collects all the revenue that allows all of us who support a ready and appropriate national defense to fund it. Education, health services, law enforcement, all the other items for which government is responsible, IRS has to collect the money.  Now, we adopted a vision of a new IRS and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Portman) and others, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cardin), a lot of others, brought this to the floor. We had a bill. We passed that bill.  The budget recommendations of the Portman report were, and I quote, the commission recommends that Congress provide the IRS certainty in its operational budget. We recommend the IRS budget for tax law enforcement and processing assistance and management be maintained at current levels.  Why? Because they said in order to carry out our responsibilities in passing this reform and restructuring bill, we need to have consistent and appropriate budget levels.  Now, around that time we hired a gentleman named Rossotti, Charles Rossotti. I think the chairman respects Mr. Rossotti. I know I do. Furthermore, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Archer) does, and Mr. Roth does. They believe he is doing the kind of job that they expected to be done if we were going to meet our responsibilities under the Reform and Restructuring Act and have an IRS that was taxpayer friendly; that is to say that answered questions in a timely fashion, responded to taxpayers and were able to go personally over tax returns with taxpayers who had a particular problem.                              {time}  1500  After the conference was brought back to the floor and I expressed my concern that I had not seen the conference, had not talked about the conference, I asked Mr. Rossotti, I said does this allow you to do what we expect you to do? Here was his comment in a letter to me of September 8, 2000: ``Please recognize that this level of funding, that is the funding level, that is provided for in this conference report, would lead to a further decline in the already low levels of compliance activity.''  I have an article which indicates that some people are saying that there is $300 billion in uncollected but due revenues. Why is that? Because compliance levels are so low and audit levels are shamefully low. I think the chairman knows that.  Mr. Rossotti, who is a Republican, hired as a manager, a business manager to carry out reform and restructuring and taxes modernization, says without funding for the Staffing Tax Administration for Balance and Equity Initiative, otherwise known as STABLE, the IRS effort to provide increased service to taxpayers and reduce the decline in audit coverage are at risk.  Substantively, the administration has a problem with this bill unrelated to politics. I share that view. So that in sum on the IRS title of this bill, we are dangerously low in providing services to the American taxpayer, and I had a discussion with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Archer) on this. I think he shares my view that it is insufficient to carry out their duties.  Mr. Speaker, courthouses, the chairman mentioned the courthouses. The administration asks for seven courthouses to be funded. The conference report, frankly without discussion as to what courthouses we were talking about, came back and funded four courthouses. Now, that courthouse list is an interesting list: California, Washington, Virginia and ends with Mississippi; the next, D.C., Buffalo, Springfield, Miami. There is a list of 19 courthouses that are in the mix and deemed not by any politicians for pork purposes, but by the GSA and by the court administration as being priority needs.  We are not going to do all of those, but the conference, the so-called conference, again, without any discussion with me or other members on our side of the aisle, decided that we were goingto fund four and forward fund for others. Now, forward funding adopts the premise that these are necessary, but we are going to fund them next year. So, in effect, we are using next year's money this year. That is what forward funding means.  That is somewhat of a gimmick, a budget gimmick; and I know many of the conservative action team has decried budget gimmicks. But now guess what, and I hope that my conservative action team friends are listening, in addition to that, we have now moved the dates for paying veterans compensation, SSI, and other pensions from one year to another.  The problem with doing that is we changed it in the supplemental the other way just a few months ago. Now, I do not know how many people know that that is in this bill. It surely was not in the bill when it left here. It was never discussed in any conference in which I participated, and it was never informed to me that this was happening.  Mr. Speaker, I do not think there is probably a Member on the floor that knows that that has happened; maybe the chairman does, it has not been discussed.  In addition, we shift $2 billion in this bill out of defense into nondefense domestic discretionary spending so that we can solve a firewall problem in the United States Senate. I cannot believe that the Contract With America that wanted to have a pristine process open and cleared to all without gimmicks that, of course, Democrats were alleged to perpetrate on the Congress, would support these provisions in this bill.  Mr. Speaker, obviously, one could go on for a long time and talk about the necessity of these bills; but one of the items that is not in this bill that the administration feels very strongly about and may well veto this bill on alone is the absence of the response to the counterterrorism initiative included in the administration's request.  There was some response in the conference report, but we left out the largest part of the administration's counterterrorism request. We think that is a problem.  The last thing I would indicate again in a process that is supposed to be an appropriations process, we have added a tax provision to this bill that was never discussed in the legislative conference. It was never discussed in any Treasury Postal conference, and anybody who gets on this floor and says that was a conferenced item that was agreed to by any conferees on the Democratic side in an open way is simply incorrect. It was never, ever discussed.  I would hope that my chairman would not make such a representation, because he knows that would be not true. I do not know how that provision became an emaculate conception on this bill, but it is now on this bill.  So for all of those reasons, I would hope that we would either recommit this bill to conference and sit down and discuss it and come up with a bill on which we could all agree or, in the alternative, defeat this conference report.
