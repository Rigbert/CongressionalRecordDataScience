President, I wanted to highlight that the Fifth Circuit is one of those circuits where for the last 6 or 7 years there was a refusal to hold any hearings on the nominees. I think we are changing the way things have been done in the past. On this nomination, there was a hearing within weeks after the nominee had cleared all the paperwork. I applaud the majority leader for bringing this nomination before the Senate.  I also thank the members of the Judiciary Committee, and the distinguished Presiding Officer, who voted for this nominee on a rollcall vote in the committee.
