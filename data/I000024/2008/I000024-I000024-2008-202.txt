President, it is my intention to withdraw this amendment, but I wish to use this moment to serve notice that this is something that not just myself but several of us are concerned about, particularly those of us on the Senate Armed Services Committee.  We have gone through a period of time, up until the early nineties, when our defense spending was somewhere around--in fact, for the entire 100 years in the 20th century, it averaged 5.7 percent of GDP. At the end of the nineties, it got down to just under 3 percent. If we are to anticipate the needs we will have in the future, it is going to be necessary to have some kind of a floor.  What this amendment says is we will have to start the process by putting 4 percent of the GDP into the defense system. It is one that would accomplish three things.  First, it would allow us to build the next generation of weapons and equipment. As we know, we are doing one weapon right now that will take the next 30 years.  Second, it will add predictability to the industrial base.  And third, it sends a clear message to our military, allies, and enemies that we are committed to the security of our Nation.  It shocks a lot of people when they find out we have platform weapons systems that are not as good as our potential adversaries. This would correct that problem.                      Amendment No. 4239 Withdrawn  Mr. President, I ask that this amendment be withdrawn.
