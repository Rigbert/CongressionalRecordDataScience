President, last week, on the 230th anniversary of the U.S. Marine corps, the U.S. Postal Service unveiled a long-awaited set of postage stamps honoring four of the corps' greatest heroes.  Today, a new generation of Americans are risking their lives to serve this Nation. Nearly 2,100 Americans have died in Iraq, and more than 15,000 others have been injured. It is important that we honor their sacrifices and the sacrifices of those who came before them. I would like to take a few moments to talk about the four legendary marines commemorated on the new stamps.  LTG John A. Lejeune is probably the best known of this fabled four. Regarded as ``the greatest of all leathernecks,'' Lieutenant General Lejeune made history in World War I as the first marine to lead what was predominantly an Army division. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal from both the Army and the Navy, as well as the French Legion of Honor and the Croix de Guerre with Palm for his service during World War I. He is best known, however, for his foresight and determination to enhance the Marine Corps by introducing specialized amphibious assault capabilities into Marine Corps training. Marines today annually read his 1921 Birthday Message Order that summarizes the history, mission, and traditions of the Marine Corps.  LTG Lewis B. ``Chesty'' Puller rose through the ranks from private to become one of the Marine Corps' most celebrated leathernecks. His distinguished service and leadership during critical battles in the `` Banana Wars,'' World War II, and the Korean War earned him five Navy Crosses and made him one of the most decorated marines ever. He led marines in two of the Corps' most daring assaults: at Guadalcanal in World War II; and at Inchon in the Korean Conflict. He died in 1971 and is still revered in the Corps today for his courage in combat and his ability to inspire confidence and loyalty and for the attention and respect he showed to those under his command.  SGM Daniel J. Daly is one of only two marines to be awarded two Medals of Honor for separate acts of heroism. According to the ``Historical Dictionary of the United States Marine Corps'', his ``record as a fighting man remains unequalled in the annals of Marine Corps history'' nearly 70 years after his death. In 1900, Sergeant Major Daly was sent to China, where he earned his first Medal of Honor during the Boxer Rebellion. In 1915, he was sent to Haiti, where he earned his second Medal of Honor fighting off nearly 400 bandits. He saw combat as a gunnery sergeant in France during World War I and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and the French Government's Croix de Guerre with Palm. He retired in 1929 and died in 1937, and remains a legend to all marines.  The fourth of the legendary marines honored on the new postage stamps is the only one the four killed in combat. One writer described him as a ``big, handsome Marine with jug ears and a smile like a neon sign.'' GEN Douglas MacArthur called him ``a one-man Army.''  Marine GySgt John Basilone was 1 of 10 children of an Italian-born tailor, Salvatore Basilone, and his wife Dora. He was born in Buffalo, NY and raised in Raritan, NJ.  He enlisted in the Army when he was 18 and served in the Philippines, where he picked up the nickname ``Manila John.'' He fought as a light heavyweight prizefighter in the Army, going undefeated in 19 fights. He received an honorable discharge after completing his 3-year enlistment, returned home, and worked briefly as a truckdriver.  In July 1940, sensing war clouds on the horizon, John Basilone enlisted in the Marine Corps. In October 1942, he was serving with the 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division, on Guadalcanal. For 6 months, the Army and Marines had fought a bloody battle to hold a critical airfield on that island. On October 24, GySgt John Basilone and 14 other marines were ordered to hold back many times that number of elite Japanese troops.  A private first class serving under him would later recall that, ``Basilone had a machine gun on the go for three days and three nights without sleep.'' He fired machine guns, fixed guns, and crawled repeatedly through Japanese lines to get more ammunition. When the sun rose the next morning, the marines still held the airfield, and John Basilone was credited by his men with giving them the will to fight on the most terrifying night of their lives.  For his heroism at Guadalcanal, John Basilone was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor and ordered home to take part in a war bonds tour. The tour brought in $1.4 million in pledges. He crisscrossed the country, met Hollywood startlets, and even met his wife, another marine, at Camp Pendleton. He could have remained stateside for the remainder of the war but, he turned down the bars of a second lieutenant because, he said, he didn't want to become ``a museum piece.'' In his words, ``I'm a plain soldier, and I want to stay one.'' So just before Christmas 1944, he kissed his new wife goodbye and rejoined his ``boys'' in the Pacific.  On February 19, 1945, SGT John Basilone was serving with the 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, 5th Marine Division during the first day of the invasion of Iwo Jima. He was on the island less than 2 hours when an enemy artillery round exploded, killing Basilone and four members of his platoon. He had just destroyed an enemy blockhouse, enabling the marines to capture another critical airfield. On his left arm were tattooed the words ``Death before Dishonor.'' John Basilone was 27 years old.  He was awarded the Navy Cross and Purple Heart posthumously, making him the only enlisted marine in World War II to be awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, the Navy Cross, and the Purple Heart. He was also awarded the American Defense Service Medal, American Campaign Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal, Presidential Unit Citation with Star, and Presidential Unit Citation with Bar.  After the war, John Basilone was reburied at Arlington National Cemetery. In 1949, the USS Basilone, a destroyer, was commissioned in his honor. Today, a life-sized bronze statue of him watches over his hometown of Raritan, NJ, and in 1981, Raritan began a parade in his honor. It remains the only parade in the Nation dedicated to the memory of one veteran.  The National Italian American Foundation, the Order of the Sons of Italy of America, the Sergeant John Basilone Foundation, and veterans and marines organizations worked long and hard to see this ``plain soldier,'' as John Basilone called himself, included among the marine heroes honored on the new stamps. We thank them for helping to make a new generation of Americans aware of the service and sacrifices of this son of an Italian immigrant, a true American hero.  When he died, The New York Times noted in an editorial that there always had been Americans like John Basilone, willing to fight for their country even when they knew their luck wouldn't last. ``The finest monument they could have,'' the newspaper said, ``would be an enduring resolve by all of us to this time fashion an enduring peace.''  Let us never forget how much we owe John Basilone and all those who have given so much, over so many generations, so that we can live free.  .                          ____________________[Pages S13334-S13335]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]HONORING SGT.
