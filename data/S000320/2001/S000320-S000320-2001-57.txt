 President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would increase the deductibility of business meals to 100 percent. By only allowing a 50 percent deduction, the current law unfairly hurts small business owners who many times conduct business face to face over a meal. For these people, the costs of business meals truly is a legitimate business expense. However, unlike other business expenses, they are not able to fully deduct the cost of business meals.  America's small businesses are the backbone of our economy. Allowing full deductibility of business related meals will lighten the heavy financial burden small business owners face daily just to be able to keep their doors open. Furthermore, increased deductibility will inject additional capital into our country's businesses, allowing them to spend more money on innovation and growth. Such activities will lead to more jobs and a stronger economy.  Full deductibility of business meals will also create an increase in restaurant patronage. As a result, my bill will benefit waiters, waitresses, cooks and other restaurant workers by increasing their job security and wages. Increased wages will make it easier for restaurant employees to meet the rising cost of living. With the cost of gasoline, electricity, and health insurance rising to unprecedented levels, higher wages can not come soon enough.  Just as importantly, increased wages will make it easier for more Americans to save for their retirement. Rather than living paycheck to paycheck, increased wages in the restaurant industry will make it possible for more people to begin to save for the future. Given the bleak predictions for the continued solvency of the Social Security trust fund, Congress must do all that it can to encourage saving.  Similar bills to increase the deductibility of business meals have been introduced in previous years. Now is the time to move beyond mere discussion and to move towards meaningful action. This legislation will have a positive effect on our economy. It fosters small business growth and will help increase wages for many Americans throughout the country. I ask that my colleagues join me in support of this bill.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 831       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
