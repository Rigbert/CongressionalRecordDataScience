 President, let me say briefly that the vote which just occurred is instructive in that I would predict that any amendment between now and the end of the debate that might have any adverse effect of any kind on organized labor is likely to be defeated.  Senator Bennett can speak for himself, but my understanding of the purpose of that amendment was to point out the imbalance between taking all non-Federal dollars away from parties at the Federal level--the State and local level in the even-numbered years--making the parties operate 100 percent in hard dollars, and yet no one else who expressly advocates a candidate through a PAC is required to do that.  We have carved out an exception for corporations and unions so that they can continue to use millions of dollars in corporate and union soft money to underwrite the expenses of their political action committees.  Having said that, the next amendment will be offered by the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Smith, who will be here momentarily. Senator Dodd and I would like for that vote to occur at 6:15 or 6:30. We will lock it in, in a few moments. It is my understanding that that will be followed by an amendment by Senator Torricelli.
