Speaker, reserving the right to object, of course, I will not object, but I do want to thank the majority leader and I want to thank the Speaker. We have all joined in this resolution. It is almost exactly like that which we passed for Ronald Reagan--two Presidents who contributed greatly, not only to the wellness of this country and the greatness of this country, but also two Presidents who inspired so many Americans about their country, about their government, and about participation by average citizens in their government.  I thank Mr. Chaffetz for bringing this to the floor, and I urge strong support of the resolution.  I withdraw my reservation of objection.
