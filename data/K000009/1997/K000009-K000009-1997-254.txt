Speaker, I wish to commend a group of explorers from our Ninth Congressional District who are on the verge of an extraordinary accomplishment: becoming the first expeditionary group ever to traverse the length of the Indus River.  Led by D.S. Amjad Hussain, professor of surgery at the Medical College of Ohio and a writer and photographer, this expeditionary team last year reached the headwaters of the Indus River in the Kailas Mountain range in western Tibet.  This year, the group plans to complete the Ladakh segment of their expedition and will then become the only expedition in history to have covered the entire length of the Indus River.  Other members of the expedition team from Toledo included: Qarie Hussain, a student at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, England; Monie Hussain, a student at the University of Michigan; and, James Adray, a practicing attorney, along with his son, Sam, a high school student. The team was privileged to carry the flags of the United States, Pakistan, and the prestigious Explorers Club on their expedition.  The Indus, one of the largest rivers in the world, arises in Tibet and winds 2,400 miles through Tibet, India, and Pakistan before emptying into the Arabian Sea near Karachi. It carries twice the annual flow of the Nile and three times that of the Tigris and Euphrates combined. Like those other great rivers, the Indus also cradled a glorious civilization along its banks as long as 5,000 years ago.  From their base camp, the expedition team traveled on foot and by yak to reach the river's source. Despite mountain sickness due to the extremely high altitudes, the team also endured a blizzard while crossing the 18,500-foot Tseti Lachen pass. They also had to cross numerous rivers swollen with late summer rains while traveling on yaks.  The team offered prayers of thankgiving when they arrived at Senge Kabob, 17,000 feet above sea level, a sacred site for Buddhists. Only two previous visits to this sacred site have been recorded.  The team now has four difficult expeditions behind them, including a photography trip on or along the Indus and its surroundings and a 2,000-mile trek in 1994 through the length of Pakistan. After completing the Ladakh segment later this year, the group will earn its place in the history books.  Congratulations and Godspeed.                               Team Indus       Team Indus is a series of Indus river expeditions designed      to study and photograph the river and its inhabitants along      its entire length. In 1987 the team travelled on rafts from      Attock in the north to Karachi on the Arabian Sea in the      south for a distance of 1400 miles. During that expedition      the team also carried out depth survey of the river for      Planning Commission of the Government of Pakistan.       During the second expedition in 1990, the team trekked the      river from Jaglot (near Gilgit) to Tarbela for a distance of      400 miles,     part of it along the north-south Silk Route, now the      Karakoram Highway.       In 1994, the team trekked the remaining part of the river      in Pakistan from the line of control in Baltistan to Jaglot      for a distance of 170 miles. On that expedition the team      carried the coveted flag of the Explorers Club.       The team explored the headwaters of the river (called Senge      Kabob or the mouth of the lion in Tibetan) in the Kailas      mountain rangers in Western Tibet in July-August, 1996. The      team covered the river close to the point where it enters      Ladakh, India. On this expedition the team also carried the      flag of the Explorers club.       Team Indus V, scheduled for 1997-98, will cover the      remaining 200 miles of the river in Ladakh.       The team has already achieved a landmark in covering the      Indus River in its entirety in Pakistan and trekking to the      headwaters of the river in Tibet. With the completion of the      segment in Ladakh, Team Indus would be the first in history      to have accomplished trekking and photographing the entire      2400 miles of the Indus.
