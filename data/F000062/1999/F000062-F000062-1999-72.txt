 President I am pleased to join my colleague Senator Kyl in introducing the ``State Criminal Alien Assistance Program II and Local Medical Emergency Reimbursement Act.''  The control of illegal immigration is a Federal responsibility. However, more and more, this burden is shifting to the states. The ``State Criminal Alien Assistance Program II and Local Medical Emergency Reimbursement Act'' (SCAAP II), properly shifts the fiscal burden of illegal immigration into the hands of the Federal Government. This bill builds upon the existing Federal obligations under the ``State Criminal Alien Assistance Program'' (SCAAP I) by providing $200 million for each of the fiscal years 2002 through 2005 to help border communities defray the indirect costs of illegal immigration, and an additional $200 million to help state and local governments cope with the cost of providing emergency medical care to illegal immigrants.  The issue of illegal immigration, is one of national consequence that requires a Federal response. Unfortunately, Federal reimbursements have consistently failed to cover the actual costs borne by States and local communities confronting the effects of illegal immigration. For those communities that continue to shoulder this burden, the control of illegal immigration has become an unfunded mandate.  Mr. President, while I consider illegal immigration an issue that pervades communities across the nation, I would like to share with my colleagues how this issue has affected my home State of California. As you might imagine, the border counties in California are among the hardest hit in terms of dollars spent on incarceration, court costs, and emergency medical care for those who have entered the U.S. illegally.  San Diego County, for example, spent an estimated $10.1 million in 1998 to cover the costs of illegal alien incarceration and spends an estimated $50 million annually to provide emergency medical care for illegal immigrants. Imperial County estimates that it spent more than $4 million last year in detention costs and another $1.36 million in emergency medical expenses.  I am greatly concerned about the disproportionate burden these costs impose on the criminal justice system, hospitals and residents of San Diego and Imperial Counties, especially given the counties' limited tax base and fiscal resources. Given what I have witnessed in my own state, it is not hard for me to understand the frustration and concern of communities in a growing number of other states. Similar burdens have fallen on border communities in states like Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. Each year, the costs borne by states to respond to illegal immigration continue to soar, while Federal involvement remains minimal at best.  Unfortunately, we can only expect these costs for border states to swell over the next few years as border enforcement initiatives force illegal migration to shift further eastward from San Diego County to neighboring southern States and counties as well as to the more porous northern state borders. In launching Operation Gatekeeper, for example, the INS hasachieved considerable success in deterring illegal border crossings along the San Diego border.  At the same time, Gatekeeper has had the effect of shifting a large volume of migrant crossings to the more rugged East San Diego County mountain area and the desert region of Imperial County where there have been numerous instances of illegal immigrants in need of emergency care. One county hospital in El Centro, for example, reports that the Border Patrol has dropped off countless numbers of undocumented aliens found in the desert suffering from hypothermia or dehydration, or from broken limbs and fractured skulls as result of failed attempts at scaling the fence along the San Diego border.  The more ``fortunate'' border crossers are being detained at state and county jails. Although states receive Federal reimbursement for some of the direct costs of incarcerating adult illegal immigrants, the Federal Government does not reimburse states and localities for the indirect costs relating to the incarceration or the control of illegal aliens, including: court costs, county attorney costs, indigent defense, criminal juvenile detention, and unsupervised probation costs. Nor does it compensate state and local hospitals for the emergency medical care provided to illegal immigrants who are not in Federal custody.  Mr. President, I join my colleagues in introducing the SCAAP II bill in hopes that it will alleviate some of the fiscal strains illegal immigration has imposed on border states and communities. I look forward to working with my colleagues to move it through the Senate.                          ____________________
