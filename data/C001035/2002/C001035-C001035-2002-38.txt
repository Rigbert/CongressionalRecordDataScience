It includes some very important information that helps us better understand why this debate is so important.  The National Partnership cites the National Governors Association's May report that over 40 States are facing budget shortfalls totaling $40 to $50 billion overall.  Since Medicaid makes up, on average, 20 percent of State spending, it is often the first place that States look to make cuts. So our amendment would provide $9 billion in total fiscal relief that would help sustain critical State Medicaid Programs and bolster the States' ability to keep providing vital social services to those most in need.  Let's look at whom this benefits.  Medicaid provides health insurance to approximately 40 million low-income Americans, including 21 million children and young adults, 11 million elderly and disabled individuals, and 8.6 million adults in families, most of whom are single mothers. That is the population that is hurt when Medicaid budgets are slashed. That is the most vulnerable of populations. They need our help.  The States need our help in order to maintain vital health care services for those 40 million low-income Americans. Without this critical safety net, millions of women and their families would be left with no health insurance at all.  So that is why we must act. And we must act before more time elapses and more States are forced to cut their Medicaid budgets. Time is of the essence.  I urge my colleagues to join with us in supporting this absolutely critical bipartisan proposal.  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
