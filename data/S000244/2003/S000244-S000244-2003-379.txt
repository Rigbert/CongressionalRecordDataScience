Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, sexual predators target America's children every day in large cities, small towns, and even in cyberspace. Sexual exploitation of children, a prime motive for kidnapping, is on the rise. When it comes to abduction, rape, and murder of children, the United States must have a zero tolerance policy.  H.R. 1104, the Child Abduction Prevention Act, is comprehensive legislation that directly and forcefully addresses these heinous crimes. The bill is virtually identical to H.R. 5422, which overwhelmingly passed the House last October by a vote of 390 to 24. Like so many other meritorious bills sent to the other body in the last Congress, this legislation was allowed to die by the Democrat leadership.  An abducted child is a parent's worst nightmare. We must ensure that law enforcement has every possible tool necessary to try to recover a missing child quickly and safely. H.R. 1104 not only gets the word out after a kidnapping, but it also takes strong steps to prevent them from occurring in the first place. The bill strengthens penalties against kidnapping and aids law enforcement agencies to effectively prevent, investigate, and prosecute crimes against children.  Prompt public alerts of an abducted child could be the difference between life and death for that innocent victim. Recognizing this, the bill codifies the AMBER Alert program currently in place in the Departments of Justice and Transportation and authorizes increased funding to help States deploy child abduction communications warning networks.  For those individuals that would harm a child, we must ensure that punishment is severe, and that sexual predators are not allowed to slip through the cracks of a system and harm other children.  To this end, this legislation provides a 20-year mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment for nonfamilial abductions of a child under the age of 18, lifetime supervision for sex offenders, and mandatory life imprisonment for second-time offenders. Furthermore, H.R. 1104 removes any statute of limitations and opportunity for pretrial release for crimes of child abduction and sex offenses.  Those who abduct children are often serial offenders who have already been convicted of similar offenses. Sex offenders and child molesters are four times more likely than other violent criminals to recommit their crimes. This number demands attention, especially in light of the fact that a single child molester, on average, destroys the lives of over 100 children. In response, H.R. 1104 provides judges with the discretion to impose lifetime supervision upon such offenders.  The bill also fights against an industry supporting one of the fastest growing areas of international criminal activity. The sex tourism industry obtains its victims through kidnapping and trafficking of women and children. These women and children are thenforced into prostitution. H.R. 1104 works to end this.  This legislation also authorizes increased support through the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the Nation's resource center for child protection. The center assists in the recovery of missing children and raises public awareness about ways to protect children from abduction, molestation, and sexual exploitation.  Some have called for a stand-alone AMBER bill instead of the comprehensive approach we have taken to address the problem of child abductions in this country. I note with interest that the DCCC, the political wing of the House Democrats, have labeled provisions of the bill I have just outlined as controversial.  I do not think these provisions are controversial. Neither do the Department of Justice, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, or the 390 Members of Congress that voted for this bill last year. Mark Klaas, father of kidnap and murder victim Polly Klaas, supports us. Mr. Klaas said, ``I'm behind what Mr. Sensenbrenner's doing. I like the idea of a 2-strike law for people who are committing sexual offenses against children. And what it says is that if somebody does that, they are going to spend the rest of their miserable life in prison if they are convicted a second time. I see no problem with putting it out on the floor and seeing where people fall on it.''  Those who say we need a stand-alone AMBER bill on the President's desk today do not understand the actual impact of such a bill. The fact is that much of the stand-alone AMBER bill has already been implemented and is in place right now.  The stand-alone AMBER bill calls for a national coordinator. On October 2, 2002, President Bush directed the Attorney General to designate a Justice Department officer to serve as AMBER Alert coordinator to help expand the AMBER Alert system nationwide. Assistant Attorney General Deborah J. Daniels was designated as that coordinator and for almost 6 months has been working to assist State and local officials with developing and enhancing AMBER plans and promoting statewide and regional AMBER coordination programs ever since.  The Departments of Justice and Transportation already have $12.5 million in the bank today, ready to respond and spend on AMBER programs.  Furthermore, in a March 18, 2003, letter to me, the Department of Justice stated that it has not been hampered in its efforts to implement an AMBER Alert program because of any legislation that has yet to be signed into law. Stand-alone AMBER legislation, in the words of the Department of Justice and their statement of administration policy, merely codifies current practice.                              {time}  1030  This Congress must do better than codifying current practice, and this bill does that. Let us be clear, if a stand-alone AMBER Alert were enacted into law today, nothing that is already being done would change. This bill merely supplants the Department of Justice general authorization with a specific authorization. It may make some feel good, but it will not help protect America's children from kidnapping and sexual abuse in the first place.  Federal money is in the pipeline for AMBER programs and is ready to be spent. A national coordinator has already been appointed. What we need now is a comprehensive legislative package that will crack down on child abductors, build and expand on the work of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and give Federal authorities additional tools to prevent and to solve these horrific crimes.  I urge my colleagues to ignore the political rhetoric and to protect America's children by supporting this bipartisan and noncontroversial child protection legislation.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
