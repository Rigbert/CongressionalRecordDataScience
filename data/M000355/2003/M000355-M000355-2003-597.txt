 President, as in executive session I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the majority leader, after consultation with the Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to executive session for the consideration of Executive Calendar No. 310, the nomination of William H. Pryor, Jr., to be United States Circuit Judge for the Eleventh Circuit; provided further that there then be 4 hours for debate equally divided in the usual form; and that following that debate the Senate proceed to a vote on the confirmation of the nomination with no intervening action or debate; further, that the President then be immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative session.
