 President, as everyone knows, I pushed the packer ban because I want more competition in the marketplace. While I don't think packers should be in the same business as independent livestock producers, it's not the fact that the packers own the livestock that bothers me as much as the fact that the packers' livestock competes for shackle space and adversely impacts the price independent producers receive.  My support of the packer ban is based in the belief that independent producers should have the opportunity to receive a fair price for their livestock. The last few years have led to widespread consolidation and concentration in the packing industry. Add on the trend toward vertical integration among packers and there is no question why independent producers are losing the opportunity to market their own livestock during profitable cycles in the live meat markets.  The past CEO of IBP in 1994 explained that the reason packers own livestock is that when the price is high the packers use their own livestock for the lines and when the price is low the packers buy livestock. This means that independent producers are most likely being limited from participating in the most profitable ranges of the live market. This is not good for the survival of the independent producer.  My new legislative concept would guarantee that independent producers have a share in the marketplace while assisting the mandatory price reporting system. The proposal would require that 25 percent of a packer's daily kill comes from the spot market. By requiring a 25 percent spot market purchase daily, the mandatory price reporting system which has been criticized due to reporting and accuracy problems would have consistent, reliable numbers being purchased from the spot market, improving the accuracy and transparency of daily prices. In addition, independent livestock producers would be guaranteed a competitive position due to the packers need to fill the daily 25 percent spot/cash market requirement.  This isn't the packer ban. The intent of this piece is to improve price transparency and hopefully the accuracy of the daily mandatory price reporting data. I feel strongly that packers should NOT be able to own or feed livestock, but this approach is not intended to address my concern with packer ownership.  The packs required to comply would be the same packs required to report under the mandatory price reporting system. Those are packs that kill either 125,000 head of cattle, 100,000 head of hogs, or 75,000 lambs annually, over a 5 year average.  Packers are arguing that this will hurt their ability to offer contracts to producers, but the fact of the matter is that the majority of livestock contracts pay out on a calculation incorporating mandatory price reporting data. If the mandatory price reporting data is not accurate, or open to possible manipulation because of low numbers on the spot market, contracts are not beneficial tools for producers to manage their risk. This legislative proposal will hopefully give confidence to independent livestock producers by improving the accuracy and viability of the mandatory price reporting system and secure fair prices for contracts based on that data.  It's just common sense, when there aren't a lot of cattle and pigs being purchased on the cash market, it's easier for the mandatory price reporting data to be inaccurate or manipulated. The majority of livestock production contracts are based on that data, so if that information is wrong the contract producers suffer. That's why the Iowa Pork Producers, Iowa Cattlemen, Iowa Farm Bureau, R-CALF, the Organization for Competitive Markets, and the Center for Rural Affairs have all endorsed this proposal.  Mr. President, this legislation will guarantee independent livestock producers market access and a fair price. It will accomplish these goals by making it more difficult for the mandatory price reporting system to be manipulated because of low numbers being reported by the packs.  I ask consent the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2867       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
