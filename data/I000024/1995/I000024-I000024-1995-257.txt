President, before we hear the analysis from the distinguished Senator from Idaho, I want to give you my own analysis. Yesterday on the floor, yesterday afternoon, I reminded the President, I reminded our fellow Members, and hopefully many in America who might be watching that those individuals who were fighting the balanced budget amendment have a very interesting profile, some things in common. I pointed out and documented that all of those 41 individuals who were the cosponsors of the right-to-know amendment to the budget balancing amendment had a very liberal background. Each one of the 41 had either a D or an F rating by the National Taxpayers Union. Each one of the individuals had voted for the very large spending program called President Clinton's tax stimulus program. And each one had voted for the 1993 tax increase which has been characterized as the largest single tax increase in the history of public finance in America or anywhere in the world.  I announced that I suspected that the 33 Democrats who managed to keep from allowing us to have that one more vote to pass a balanced budget amendment yesterday would fit this same profile. I have analyzed this. I did this personally last night and I will give you the results of that.  Of the 33 Democrats--and it only took one to come over to our side and to free the future generations from the shackles they are going to be bound with--all 33 voted on the cloture vote in favor of the tax stimulus program, which was the big spending program. All 33 have a D or an F rating by the National Taxpayers Union. And 31 of the 33--all but 2 of them--voted for the largest single tax increase in the history of public finance in America or any place in the world.
