Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I was sitting here listening to the gentleman from Michigan, the dean of the House [Mr. Dingell], give his compliments for my good friend, the gentleman from Massachusetts, and I cannot echo those words enough. I can assure him as one that has been the author and the worker of the Magnuson Act, and the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller], I want them both to be aware that I have not left this subject. As I mentioned, we have reviewed this three times.  I will cherish the advice that the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Studds] can give me on this issue as he goes into another life. We have modern communications today, far exceed that which we had in the past. As a friend, I expect him to keep in contact with me on issues that he thinks are important to the sea.  The gentleman from California himself brought up some issues that I believe very strongly in. I happen to think that the issuance of an IDQ, or IFQ, and then creating a great value of it, to be sold for wealth, is very wrong, and it is wrong to accumulate a massive amount, creating a monopoly. We are going to continue to address those issues as the future unfolds as far as our seas go.  I would like to say, Mr. Speaker, to my friends in the House, I would like to extend our interest in the oceans beyond the 200 miles. We sometimes concentrate, because fishermen vote and fishermen are very vocal and they are probably the hardest group in the world to represent, but I would like to extend our interest concerning what effect is going on beyond the 200 miles.                              {time}  1130  Because the key to our survival in this Nation today and all nations in this world is a healthy, providing ocean. If it is unhealthy, it does not provide. If it does not provide, I do not think any nation can survive. Someonewho may live in the middle of our great Nation or the middle of Russia or the middle of India or the middle of China may say, what has that got to do with me? All of our food cycle chain and all of our wealth eventually is created from the sea.  So I am going to suggest in the future, if I have anything to do with it, with the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller], that we extend not only beyond the 200 miles, I mean brought within the 200 miles, to be beyond the 200 miles, internationally trying to come to grips with, are the seas healthy, are the species healthy, have we done something wrong, have the death curtains been eliminated, what should we be doing, not impinging upon people's rights but how do we prevail in maintaining a healthy sea.   Mr. Speaker, again, in closing, I can suggest that those who have worked with me over the years on these issues, the ocean, I deeply appreciate their friendship and especially their dedication. The staffs that have been working with the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Studds] are exceptionally good. We will continue to overview and to watch the great oceans that surround our shores.
