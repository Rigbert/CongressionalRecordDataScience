President, let me thank the Senator from Louisiana. She has been through an ordeal, as well as her colleague, Senator Vitter, with the Katrina damage and what followed. She has been on this floor every day and in private meetings every single day, exhorting this Senate, both Democrats and Republicans, not to forget what happened to her home State. It is a tragedy that none of us would like to see befall our own States, and we owe it to her to work with the President, on a bipartisan basis, first, to help the evacuees and victims; second, to make sure the great city of New Orleans is back and running as quickly as possible; third, to make the changes that are necessary to give them peace of mind and security for generations to come.  I have listened to her time and again come to the floor and talk about health care and education, the basics that people need to survive. I worry, as I am sure she does, that we are going through Katrina fatigue, that we have heard it for so long we want to turn the page and talk about other things. Thank you for reminding us every single day we cannot turn that page. I have met with those victims. Some have come to Illinois. I tell you but for the generosity and compassion of churches, charities, and local community groups, I do not know how some of these families would have survived.  What has happened in farflung communities in Illinois is that these evacuees have been embraced--and thank goodness that happened because otherwise they tell me they wouldn't have known where to turn. When the Government should have been there, it was not there. Sadly, we have to step back now and take an honest evaluation of why that happened.  I know the Senator from Louisiana shares my belief that if we had an independent, nonpartisan commission--which we have been begging for for weeks now--to take a look at what happened, not so much that we can figure out who to blame but so that we make sure we never do it again. We hear complaints about FEMA--a few weeks ago in Florida and complaints in Texas. We can do better. When it comes to disasters facing America, natural and otherwise, we can do better. I think we need to come together in an independent, nonpartisan way to make that happen.                             Ahmed Chalabi  It is almost hard to believe, and impossible to explain, what is going on in Washington today as we honor and fete Ahmed Chalabi. Who is Ahmed Chalabi? He enjoys the rank of Deputy Prime Minister in the nation of Iraq. But he enjoys a very questionable reputation otherwise.  Ahmed Chalabi, it turns out, was one of the key advisers to the Bush administration before the invasion of Iraq. He was so important to the Bush administration that they paid his organization, through the Defense Intelligence Agency, $335,000 a month to sustain his life and his office. Overall, the Bush White House gave his Iraqi National Congress $39 million over the last 5 years, $39 million to this Ahmed Chalabi. Ahmed Chalabi is an expatriate from Iraq, now returned with Saddam Hussein being removed from power, and he has been bankrolled by our Government as long as President Bush has been in office. His Iraqi National Congress was a major source of misinformation and disinformation about the situation in Iraq before our invasion. He was the one who was producing the evidence that led the administration to tell the American people there were weapons of mass destruction.
