 President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will help address a troublesome byproduct of our Nation's mining history: abandoned mines.  The 1872 Mining Law created national standards to regulate gold and silver mining operations on Federal lands. Since then, hundreds of thousands of gold and silver mines have been abandoned.  There are roughly 500,000 abandoned mines across the U.S., and nearly 47,000 abandoned mines in my home State of California.  According to the California Department of Conservation, all but two of California's 58 counties have abandoned mines; and close to 70 percent of California's abandoned mines are located in the ``Mother Lode'' area in the Northern Sierra or San Bernardino, Inyo and Kern Counties in the southeastern part of the State.  Because the 1872 Mining Law is so outdated, we have been unable to adequately clean up and remediate these abandoned mines.  The need for action is great.  The bill that I am introducing today, is not intended to be a comprehensive hardrock mining reform bill, but it is an important piece of the reform that is needed in hardrock mining.  The Abandoned Mine Reclamation Act of 2008, will reform the 1872 Mining Law by: establishing fees to support abandoned mine cleanup; establishing a royalty payment system; and creating an Abandoned Mine Cleanup Fund.  Unlike the coal industry, the metal mining industry does not pay to clean up its legacy of abandoned mines, making lack of funding the primary obstacle to abandoned hardrock mine cleanup.  This legislation would help fund the cleanup of abandoned mines by placing an Abandoned Mine Reclamation fee on all hardrock minerals, using the underground coal industry fee program as a model.  Here is why--the condition of abandoned coal mines has greatly improved since the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 established a fee to finance restoration of land abandoned or inadequately restored by coal mining companies.  This fund has been able to raise billions of dollars for coal mine reclamation--and I believe that a similar program could be part of the solution to the hardrock abandoned mine cleanup.  This legislation also establishes a royalty on Hardrock Mining Claims.  Companies that mine for gold and silver on Federal lands are not currently required to pay any royalties to the Federal Government--even though we are experiencing near record high gold prices, around $900 an ounce.  These companies should be required to pay their fair share.  The Abandoned Mine Reclamation Act establishes an 8 percent royalty on new mining operations located on Federal lands, and a 4 percent royalty for existing operations.  These royalties are at the same level as the Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act, H.R. 2262, which was passed by the House late last year.  The legislation I am introducing today also creates an Abandoned Mine Fund.  In these times of budget deficits, it's clear that we will not be able to simply appropriate the funds necessary to clean up the hundreds of thousands of abandoned hard rock mines.  So, this legislation will create an abandoned mine cleanup fund to ensure that we have a lasting source of funding for this critical cleanup effort.  Specifically, the fund will direct the royalties, as well as other payments collected from mining operations, and dedicate them to the cleanup of abandoned hardrock mines.  Now I would like to take a moment to talk more about why abandoned mines are so problematic.  First, members of the public are in danger of getting seriously hurt or killed by falling down old mine shafts.  In the past 2 years, eight accidents at abandoned mine sites were reported in California. These accidents resulted in four fatalities and seven others were injured and/or required rescuing.  But the even greater threat from abandoned mines comes from the danger of groundwater pollution.  Environmental impact studies have shown that important watersheds are being polluted by high levels of mercury or increased sedimentation.  This in turn exposes people who drink this water to harmful minerals like mercury, chromium and asbestos and the fish who swim in streams fed by these waters are likewise contaminated.  The Bureau of Land Management reports that abandoned mines have contaminated 17 major watersheds in California, which supply water for millions of people and provide habitat for important species like salmon and other fish that are caught and consumed by the public.  So, the threat to public health is critical.  Mining has played in California's history. The discovery of gold at Sutter Mill near Placerville, California in 1848 was a defining moment for California and the U.S.  It is fair to say that without mining and the Gold Rush, California and the entire country would be a far different place than it is today.  The great history of mining in California, however, is tarnished by the legacy of tens of thousands of abandoned mines. In particular, abandoned mine sites on Federal lands.  Let me illustrate a few examples of abandoned mine sites located on Federal land in California.  These sites are causing serious public safety and environmental problems: Rand Historic Mining Complex located on BLM land in eastern Kern County and northwestern San Bernardino County.  This area includes the Kelly Silver Mine and the Yellow Aster Gold Mine near the communities of Johannesburg, Randsburg, and Red Mountain.  The problem is this: The sites contain extensive arsenic-bearing mine waste and numerous open mine shafts that could cause safety hazards.  The Pond Gold Mine Site located in Placer County on BLM land.  This mine site consists of an extensive network of sluice tunnels and a large waste rock pile.  Here's the problem: The Pond Mine has been determined to be a source of mercury to Pond Creek and the Middle Fork of the American River.  The Golinsky Mine located on Forest Service land located in Shasta County.  The Golinsky mine is an abandoned copper mine that is releasing acid mine drainage into Shasta Lake.  The responsible party has been identified, but has declared bankruptcy. This has forced the Forest Service to spend more than $2.2 million dollars investigating and mitigating the environmental problems while they try to recoup the costs.  There are numerous abandoned mine sites that may not yet have been discovered all across California.  One place where we expect the problem to grow is in Joshua Tree National Park.  Joshua Tree has numerous former mine sites that contain a series of shafts near trails and roads. These mine shafts vary in size and the depth ranges from 20 to 200 feet deep--and are extremely dangerous, potentially causing people to fall into them.  So, these abandoned mines are a serious problem throughout the State. We need to take action soon to clean them up.  The problems caused by abandoned mines are not going away--and with each passing day, the health danger will continue to rise.  It is important to our children and grandchildren that we start the process of cleaning up the abandoned mines that were left to us. But we cannot do it without a substantial and reliable source of funding.  Here is the key: this legislation doesn't reinvent the wheel. It implements solutions that have been working for a similar problem. It uses many of the ideas that have helped the coal industry to raise over seven billion dollars for abandoned mines.  It is time to expect the same from the hardrock mining industry.  Though this legislation is a significant step forward for the funding of abandoned mines, I know that there is much more mining reform to be done.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that the 1872 Mining Law is reformed--so that 21st Century mining regulations will be applied to 21st Century mining operations.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2750       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(d) Application of Act to Beneficiation and Processing of      Non-Federal Minerals on Federal Lands.--The provisions of      this Act shall apply in the same manner and to the same      extent to mining claims, millsite claims, and tunnel site      claims used for beneficiation or processing activities for      any mineral without regard to whether or not the legal and      beneficial title to the mineral is held by the United States.      This subsection applies only to minerals that are locatable      minerals or minerals that would be locatable minerals if the      legal and beneficial title to such minerals were held by the      United States.              TITLE I--MINERAL EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT     SEC. 101. ROYALTY.       (a) Reservation of Royalty.--       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2) and      subject to paragraph (3), production of all locatable      minerals from any mining claim located under the general      mining laws and maintained in compliance with this Act, or      mineral concentrates or products derived from locatable      minerals from any such mining claim, as the case may be,      shall be subject to a royalty of 8 percent of the gross      income from mining. The claim holder or any operator to whom      the claim holder has assigned the obligation to make royalty      payments under the claim and any person who controls such      claim holder or operator shall be liable for payment of such      royalties.       (2) Royalty for federal lands subject to existing permit.--     The royalty under     paragraph (1) shall be 4 percent in the case of any Federal      land that--       (A) is subject to an operations permit on the date of the      enactment of this Act; and       (B) produces valuable locatable minerals in commercial      quantities on the date of enactment of this Act.       (3) Federal land added to existing operations permit.--Any      Federal land added through a plan modification to an      operations permit that is submitted after the date of      enactment of this Act shall be subject to the royalty that      applies to Federal land under paragraph (1).       (4) Deposit.--Amounts received by the United States as      royalties under this subsection shall be deposited into the      Abandoned Mine Cleanup Fund established by section 201(a).       (b) Duties of Claim Holders, Operators, and Transporters.--     (1) A person--       (A) who is required to make any royalty payment under this      section shall make such payments to the United States at such      times and in such manner as the Secretary may by rule      prescribe; and       (B) shall notify the Secretary, in the time and manner as      may be specified by the Secretary, of any assignment that      such person may have made of the obligation to make any      royalty or other payment under a mining claim.       (2) Any person paying royalties under this section shall      file a written instrument, together with the first royalty      payment, affirming that such person is responsible for making      proper payments for all amounts due for all time periods for      which such person has a payment responsibility. Such      responsibility for the periods referred to in the preceding      sentence shall include any and all additional amounts billed      by the Secretary and determined to be due by final agency or      judicial action. Any person liable for royalty payments under      this section who assigns any payment obligation shall remain      jointly and severally liable for all royalty payments due for      the claim for the period.       (3) A person conducting mineral activities shall--       (A) develop and comply with the site security provisions in      the operations permit designed to protect from theft the      locatable minerals, concentrates or products derived      therefrom which are produced or stored on a mining claim, and      such provisions shall conform with such minimum standards as      the Secretary may prescribe by rule, taking into account the      variety of circumstances on mining claims; and       (B) not later than the 5th business day after production      begins anywhere on a mining claim, or production resumes      after more than 90 days after production was suspended,      notify the Secretary, in the manner prescribed by the      Secretary, of the date on which such production has begun or      resumed.       (4) The Secretary may by rule require any person engaged in      transporting a locatable mineral, concentrate, or product      derived therefrom to carry on his or her person, in his or      her vehicle, or in his or her immediate control,      documentation showing, at a minimum, the amount, origin, and      intended destination of the locatable mineral, concentrate,      or product derived therefrom in such circumstances as the      Secretary determines is appropriate.       (c) Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements.--A claim      holder, operator, or other person directly involved in      developing, producing, processing, transporting, purchasing,      or selling locatable minerals, concentrates, or products      derived therefrom, subject to this Act, through the point of      royalty computation shall establish and maintain any records,      make any reports, and provide any information that the      Secretary may reasonably require for the purposes of      implementing this section or determining compliance with      rules or orders under this section. Such records shall      include, but not be limited to, periodic reports, records,      documents, and other data. Such reports may also include, but      not be limited to, pertinent technical and financial data      relating to the quantity, quality, composition volume,      weight, and assay of all minerals extracted from the mining      claim. Upon the request of any officer or employee duly      designated by the Secretary conducting an audit or      investigation pursuant to this section, the appropriate      records, reports, or information that may be required by this      section shall be made available for inspection and      duplication by such officer or employee. Failure by a claim      holder, operator, or other person referred to in the first      sentence to cooperate with such an audit, provide data      required by the Secretary, or grant access to information      may, at the discretion of the Secretary, result in      involuntary forfeiture of the claim.       (d) Audits.--The Secretary is authorized to conduct such      audits of all claim holders, operators, transporters,      purchasers, processors, or other persons directly or      indirectly involved in the production or sales of minerals      covered by this Act, as the Secretary deems necessary for the      purposes of ensuring compliance with the requirements of this      section. For purposes of performing such audits, the      Secretary shall, at reasonable times and upon request, have      access to, and may copy, all books, papers and other      documents that relate to compliance with any provision of      this section by any person.       (e) Cooperative Agreements.--(1) The Secretary is      authorized to enter into cooperative agreements with the      Secretary of Agriculture to share information concerning the      royalty management of locatable minerals, concentrates, or      products derived therefrom, to carry out inspection,      auditing, investigation, or enforcement (not including the      collection of royalties, civil or criminal penalties, or      other payments) activities under this section in cooperation      with the Secretary, and to carry out any other activity      described in this section.       (2) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection      (relating to trade secrets), and pursuant to a cooperative      agreement, the Secretary of Agriculture shall, upon request,      have access to all royalty accounting information in the      possession of the Secretary respecting the production,      removal, or sale of locatable minerals, concentrates, or      products derived therefrom from claims on lands open to      location under this Act.       (3) Trade secrets, proprietary, and other confidential      information protected from disclosure under section 552 of      title 5, United States Code, popularly known as the Freedom      of Information Act, shall be made available by the Secretary      to other Federal agencies as necessary to assure compliance      with this Act and other Federal laws. The Secretary, the      Secretary of Agriculture, the Administrator of the      Environmental Protection Agency, and other Federal officials      shall ensure that such information is provided protection in      accordance with the requirements of that section.       (f) Interest and Substantial Underreporting Assessments.--     (1) In the case of mining claims where royalty payments are      not received by the Secretary on the date that such payments      are due, the Secretary shall charge interest on such      underpayments at the same interest rate as the rate      applicable under section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue      Code of 1986. In the case of an underpayment, interest shall      be computed and charged only on the amount of the deficiency      and not on the total amount.       (2) If there is any underreporting of royalty owed on      production from a claim for any production month by any      person liable for royalty payments under this section, the      Secretary shall assess a penalty of not greater than 25      percent of the amount of that underreporting.       (3) For the purposes of this subsection, the term      ``underreporting'' means the difference between the royalty      on the value of the production that should have been reported      and the royalty on the value of the production which was      reported, if the value that should have been reported is      greater than the value that was reported.       (4) The Secretary may waive or reduce the assessment      provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection if the person      liable for royalty payments under this section corrects the      underreporting before the date such person receives notice      from the Secretary that an underreporting may have occurred,      or before 90 days after the date of the enactment of this      section, whichever is later.       (5) The Secretary shall waive any portion of an assessment      under paragraph (2) of this subsection attributable to that      portion of the underreporting for which the person      responsible for paying the royalty demonstrates that--       (A) such person had written authorization from the      Secretary to report royalty on the value of the production on      basis on which it was reported;       (B) such person had substantial authority for reporting      royalty on the value of the production on the basis on which      it was reported;       (C) such person previously had notified the Secretary, in      such manner as the Secretary may by rule prescribe, of      relevant reasons or facts affecting the royalty treatment of      specific production which led to the underreporting; or       (D) such person meets any other exception which the      Secretary may, by rule, establish.       (6) All penalties collected under this subsection shall be      deposited in the Abandoned Mine Cleanup Fund established by      section 201(a).       (g) Delegation.--For the purposes of this section, the term      ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the Interior acting      through the Director of the Minerals Management Service.       (h) Expanded Royalty Obligations.--Each person liable for      royalty payments under this section shall be jointly and      severally liable for royalty on all locatable minerals,      concentrates, or products derived therefrom lost or wasted      from a mining claim located under the general mining laws and      maintained in compliance with this Act when such loss or      waste is due to negligence on the part of any person or due      to the failure to comply with any rule, regulation, or order      issued under this section.       (i) Gross Income From Mining Defined.--For the purposes of      this section, for any locatable mineral, the term ``gross      income from mining'' has the same meaning as the term ``gross      income'' in section 613(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of      1986.       (j) Effective Date.--The royalty under this section shall      take effect with respect to the production of locatable      minerals after the enactment of this Act, but any royalty      payments attributable to production during the first 12      calendar months after the enactment of this Act shall be      payable at the expiration of such 12-month period.       (k) Failure To Comply With Royalty Requirements.--Any      person who fails to comply with the requirements of this      section or any regulation or order issued to implement this      section shall be liable for a civil penalty under section 109      of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act (30 U.S.C.      1719) to     the same extent as if the claim located under the general      mining laws and maintained in compliance with this Act were a      lease under that Act.

(2)(A) The claim maintenance fee required under this      subsection shall be waived for a claimant who certifies in      writing to the Secretary that on the date the payment was      due, the claimant and all related parties--       (i) held not more than 10 mining claims, mill sites, or      tunnel sites, or any combination thereof, on public lands;      and       (ii) have performed assessment work required under the      Mining Law of 1872 (30 U.S.C. 28 et seq.) to maintain the      mining claims held by the claimant and such related parties      for the assessment year ending on noon of September 1 of the      calendar year in which payment of the claim maintenance fee      was due.       (B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), with respect to any      claimant, the term ``all related parties'' means--       (i) the spouse and dependent children (as defined in      section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986), of the      claimant; or       (ii) a person affiliated with the claimant, including--       (I) a person controlled by, controlling, or under common      control with the claimant; or       (II) a subsidiary or parent company or corporation of the      claimant.       (3)(A) The Secretary shall adjust the fees required by this      subsection to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index      published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department      of Labor every 5 years after the date of enactment of this      Act, or more frequently if the Secretary determines an      adjustment to be reasonable.

(2) Moneys received under this subsection that are not      otherwise allocated for the administration of the mining laws      by the Department of the Interior shall be deposited in the      Abandoned Mine Cleanup Fund established by section 201(a).       (d) Co-Ownership.--The co-ownership provisions of the      Mining Law of 1872 (30 U.S.C. 28 et seq.) will remain in      effect except that the annual claim maintenance fee, where      applicable, shall replace applicable assessment requirements      and expenditures.       (e) Failure To Pay.--Failure to pay the claim maintenance      fee as required by subsection (a) shall conclusively      constitute a forfeiture of the unpatented mining claim, mill      or tunnel site by the claimant and the claim shall be deemed      null and void by operation of law.       (f) Other Requirements.--       (1) Nothing in this section shall change or modify the      requirements of section 314(b) of the Federal Land Policy and      Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1744(b)), or the      requirements of section 314(c) of the Federal Land Policy and      Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1744(c)) related to filings      required by section 314(b) of that Act, which remain in      effect.
