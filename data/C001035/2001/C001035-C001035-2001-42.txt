President, I am pleased to join with my friend and colleague, Senator Russ Feingold, in introducing legislation today to provide needed financial relief to rural ambulance providers.  Historically, Medicare payments for ambulance services provided by freestanding ambulance providers have been based on a proportion of their reasonable charges, while payments to hospital-based providers have beenbased on their actual costs. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997, however, directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a fee schedule for the payment of ambulance services using a negotiated rulemaking process. This rulemaking Committee finalized its agreement in February of 2000, and the then-Health Care Financing Administration, HCFA, issued a proposed rule last September. The new fee schedule was originally scheduled to start on January 1, 2001, but its implementation has been delayed while HCFA, now the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, continues to work on publishing a final rule.  Payment under this new fee schedule will preclude hospital providers of ambulance services from recouping their actual costs. For the average, high-volume urban provider, this should not pose a significant problem. Ambulance services in rural areas, however, tend to have higher fixed costs and low volume, which means that they are unable to take advantage of any economies of scale. I am therefore extremely concerned that the proposed rule fails to include a meaningful adjustment for low-volume ambulance providers.  I recently heard about the impact that this change will have on one of Maine's rural hospitals, Franklin Memorial Hospital in Farmington, ME. Logging, tourism, and recreational activities are central to the economic viability of this region, and good emergency transport is essential Franklin Memorial owns and operates five local ambulance services that cover more than 2,000 square miles of rural Maine. They serve some of the most remote areas of the State, and ambulances often have to travel more than 80 miles to reach the hospital. Moreover, these trips frequently involve backwoods and wilderness rescues which require highly trained staff. Since there are only 30,000 people in Franklin Memorial's service area, however, volume is very low.  Under the current Medicare reimbursement system, Franklin Memorial has just managed to break even on its ambulance services. Under the proposed fee schedule, however, these services stand to lose up to $500,000 a year, system-wide. While the small towns served by Franklin Memorial help to subsidize this service, there is no way that they can absorb this loss. The Medicare, Medicaid and S-CHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act, BIPA, did increase the mileage adjustment for rural ambulance providers driving between 17 and 50 miles by $1.25. While this is helpful, it will not begin to compensate low-volume ambulance services like Franklin Memorial Hospital adequately.  Congress has required the General Accounting Office to conduct a study of costs in low-volume areas, but any GAO-recommended adjustments in the ambulance fee schedule would not be effective until 2004. The Rural Ambulance Relief Act that I am introducing today with Senator Feingold will therefore establish a hold harmless provision allowing rural ambulance providers to elect to be paid on a reasonable cost basis until the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is able to identify and adjust payments under the new ambulance fee schedule for services provided in low-volume rural areas.                                 ______                                       By
