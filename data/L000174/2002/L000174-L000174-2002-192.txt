President, due to time constraints, the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, estimate was not included in the report to accompany S. 2621, an act to provide a definition of vehicle for purposes of criminal penalties relating to terrorist attacks and other acts of violence against mass transportation systems. The report isnow available and, therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the attached CBO estimate be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Congress,                                  Congressional Budget Office,                                    Washington, DC, June 27, 2002.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has      prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 2621, an act to      provide a definition of vehicle for purposes of criminal      penalties relating to terrorist attacks and other acts of      violence against mass transportation systems.       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be      pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Mark      Grabowicz.           Sincerely,                                                Barry B. Anderson,                                   [For Dan L. Crippen, Director.]       Enclosure.       Congressional Budget Office cost estimate--S. 2621--an act      to provide a definition of vehicle for purposes of criminal      penalties relating to terrorist attacks and other acts of      violence against mass transportation systems.       As passed by the Senate on June 25, 2002.       The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-56) established      a new federal offense for acts of violence against mass      transportation systems. S. 2621 would clarify the definition      of the term ``vehicle'' as used in that act. CBO estimates      that implementing S. 2621 would result in no significant      costs to the federal government. The legislation could affect      direct spending and receipts through greater collections of      criminal fines, so pay-as-you-go procedures would apply.      However, CBO estimates that any effects on direct spending or      receipts would be significant because of the small number of      cases likely to be affected.       S. 2621 contains on intergovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and      would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments.       The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Mark Grabowicz.      This estimate was approved by Robert A. Sunshine, Assistant      Director for Budget Analysis.                          ____________________
