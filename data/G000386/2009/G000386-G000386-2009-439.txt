 President, I would like to briefly explain my vote against final passage of S. 22, the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009. I would like to be clear that I do not oppose every aspect of this bill, nor do I oppose the notion that our Nation's most unique and precious natural features should be protected for the use and enjoyment of future generations. As with many large omnibus bills, there are a number of provisions that enjoy strong support in the Senate. However, taken as a whole, this bill represents an enormous commitment of federal resources in perpetuity that we simply cannot afford at this time. For years, our existing national parks, wildlife refuges, and other public lands have been faced with a backlog of much-needed maintenance projects because we have not had the resources to do everything that needs to be done along with competing budget priorities. Now, in the midst of an economic downturn and on the eve of considering an historically large economic stimulus package, the strain on Federal budgets has rarely been greater. In light of this fact, it is intellectually dishonest to promise to the American people that the Federal Government will protect and maintain additional Federal lands when we know that we are not even able to fully keep our current commitments. For that reason, I felt it necessary to vote no on this bill at this time.                          ____________________
