 President, the urban demands we have placed on our water supplies and ecosystem have resulted in significant water shortages in communities across the Nation. Water quality and quantity are in jeopardy if local, State, and Federal Governments do not support the implementation of cost-effective projects that enhance and increase potable water supplies.  Therefore, I am introducing this bill to authorize programs that will facilitate a comprehensive water supply and watershed project in southern California. Leaders and agencies across five counties in the Santa Ana Region of southern California have partnered to develop a comprehensive plan which addresses regional needs of their communities; communities whose population exceeds 3 million citizens. These communities are committed to leveraging over $1 billion in local and State funds to match the Federal Government's investment. Similar legislation has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Gary Miller, together with Representatives Ken Calvert, David Dreier, Edward Royce, John Campbell, Dana Rohrabacher and Loretta Sanchez.  Specifically, this bill would fund three distinct projects, which together will help address water needs of 64,000 households and increase the region's water supply by 31,000 acre-feet per year in an environmentally sustainable manner.  This legislation could serve as a model for communities nationwide to help meet the challenges imposed by decreasing snow pack and precipitation and scarce potable water supplies that will be exacerbated by climate change.  This bill would authorize the Federal Government to spend $10 million on a cost shared basis to create wetlands along the Santa Ana River, providing an expanded natural treatment system to purify the River before it replenishes Orange County's groundwater supplies. Like all of the projects in the plan, the construction of natural treatment systems using wetlands minimizes the impacts on the environment, reduces carbon emissions, and improves the quality of our groundwater supplies without costly control technologies.  An authorization of $25 million in the expansion of groundwater desalination in the Chino Basin would increase desalination from the current 9,000 acre-feet per year to 40,000 acre-feet per year. This element of the program would provide a new fresh drinking water supply for Jurupa Community Services District, Santa Ana Mutual Water Company in Riverside County, and the cities of Norco, Chino, Chino Hills, and Ontario in San Bernardino County. These communities serve the needs of millions of citizens.  Because the Santa Ana River watershed crosses multiple jurisdictions, this legislation seeks to complement the ability to produce reclaimed water in one area with expanded desalination projects in the neighboring Chino Basin, providing a four-fold increase in the ability to desalinate groundwater supplies. The Chino Basin groundwater desalters will be the primary drinking water supply for over 40,000 new homes in Riverside and San Bernardino Counties.  The Groundwater Replenishment System, which is expected to be fully operational in just weeks, is the largest indirect potable reuse project in the world. The focal point of the system is membrane purification technology. Thus, $12 million is being requested to build an advanced water filtration technologies research center to find better, more cost-effective approaches to water purification as it relates to municipal water supply needs.  This regional plan will decrease reliability on imported water supplies from the Colorado River and California's deteriorating Bay-Delta water supply system. It will also allow for banking millions of gallons of water in our groundwater basin, protecting the region against natural disasters that could disrupt the delivery of water to Southern California from the fragile Delta and Colorado systems.  I am proud of the commitment our regional agencies have made to develop a response to meet the current and future demands for water supply. The regional plan has broad community support, solves multiple water supply problems, reduces energy consumption, restores habitat, and provides significant jobs and economic benefits to one of the Nation's most densely populated areas. I look forward to timely consideration of this legislation that could provide the road map to solving water demands across the country.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2259       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
