Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in support of S. 3022.  For the last 6 years, the Subcommittee on Water and Power of the Committee on Resources has pursued legislation to shrink the size and scope of the Federal Government through the defederalization of the Bureau of Reclamation assets.  S. 3022 continues this defederalization process by directing the Secretary of the Interior to convey, as soon as practical after the date of enactment, certain facilities to the Nampa and Meridian Irrigation District, pursuant to the Memorandum of Agreement between the Secretary of the Interior and the district.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``aye'' on this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.
