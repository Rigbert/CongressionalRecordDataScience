 President, I rise today to introduce the Japanese Imperial Army Disclosure Act of 1999.  This legislation will require the disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act classified records and documents in the possession of the U.S. Government regarding chemical and biological experiments carried out by Japan during the course of the Second World War.  Let me preface my statement by making clear that none of the remarks that I will make in discussing this legislation should be considered anti-Japanese. I was proud to serve as the President of the Japan Society of Northern California, and I have done everything I can to foster, promote, and develop positive relations between Japan, the United States, China, and other states of the region. The legislation I introduce today is eagerly sought by a large number of Californians who believe that there is an effort to keep information about possible atrocities and experiments with poisonous gas and germ warfare from the pubic record.  One of my most important goals in the Senate is to see the development of a Pacific Rim community that is peaceful and stable. I have worked towards this end for over twenty years. I introduce this legislation to try to heal wounds that still remain, particularly in California's Chinese-American community.  This legislation is needed because although the Second World War ended over fifty years ago--and with it Japan's chemical and biological weapons experimentation programs--many of the records and documents regarding Japan's wartime activities remain classified and hidden in U.S. Government archives and repositories. Even worse, according to some scholars, some of these records are now being inadvertently destroyed.  For the many U.S. Army veteran's who were subject to these experiments in POW camps, as well as the many Chinese and other Asian civilians who were subjected to these experiments, the time has long since passed for the full truth to come out.  According to information which was revealed at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, starting in 1931, when the so-called ``Mukden incident'' provided Japan the pretext for the occupation of Manchuria, the Japanese Imperial Army conducted numerous biological and chemical warfare tests on Chinese civilians, Allied POWs, and possibly Japanese civilians as well.  Perhaps the most notorious of these experiments were carried out under General Ishii Shiro, a Japanese Army surgeon, who, by the late 1930's had built a large installation in China with germ breeding facilities, testinggrounds, prisons to hold the human test subjects, facilities to make germ weapons, and a crematorium for the final disposal of the human test victims. General Ishii's main factory operated under the code name Unit 731.  Based on the evidence revealed at the War Crimes trials, as well as subsequent work by numerous scholars, there is little doubt that Japan conducted these chemical and biological warfare experiments, and that the Japanese Imperial Army attempted to use chemical and biological weapons during the course of the war, included reports of use of plague on the cities of Ningbo and Changde.  And, as a 1980 article by John Powell in the Bulletin of Concerned Asia Scholars found,       Once the fact had been established that Ishii had used      Chinese and others as laboratory tests subjects, it seemed a      fair assumption that he also might have used American      prisoners, possibly British, and perhaps even Japanese.  Some of the records of these activities were revealed during the Tokyo War Crimes trials, and others have since come to light under Freedom of Information Act requests, but many other documents, which were transferred to the U.S. military during the occupation of Japan, have remained hidden for the past fifty years.  And it is precisely for this reason that this legislation is needed: The world is entitled to a full and compel record of what did transpire.  Sheldon Harris, Professor of History Emeritus at California State university Northridge wrote to me on October 7 of this year that:       In my capacity as an academic Historian, I can testify to      the difficulty researchers have in unearthing documents and      personal testimony concerning these war crimes * * *. Here in      the United States, despite the Freedom of Information Act,      some archives remain closed to investigators * * *. Moreover,      ``sensitive documents--as defined by archivists and FOIA      officers--are at the moment being destroyed.  Professor Sheldon's letter goes on to discuss three examples of the destruction of documents relating to chemical and biological warfare experiments that he is aware of: At Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah, at Fort Detrick in Maryland, and at the Pentagon.  This legislation establishes, within 60 days after the enactment of the act, the Japanese Imperial Army Records Interagency Working Group, including representation by the Department of State and the Archivist of the United States, to locate, identify, and recommend for declassification all Japanese Imperial Army records of the United States.  This Interagency Work Group, which will remain in existence for three years, is to locate, identify, inventory, recommend for classification, and make available to the public all classified Imperial Army records of the United States. It is to do so in coordination with other agencies, and to submit a report to Congress describing its activities.  It is my belief that the establishment of such an Interagency Working Group is the best way to make sure that the documents which need to be declassified will be declassified, and that this process will occur in an orderly and expeditious manner.  This legislation also includes exceptions which would allow the Interagency Working Group to deny release of records on the basis of: 1. Records which may unfairly invade an individual's privacy; 2. Records which adversely affect the national security or intelligence capabilities of the United States; 3. Records which might ``seriously or demonstrably impair relations between the United States and a foreign government''; and, 4. Records which might contribute to the development of chemical or biological capabilities.  My purpose in introducing this legislation is to help those who were victimized by these experiments and, with the adage ``the truth shall set you free'' in mind, help build a more peaceful Asian-Pacific community for the twenty-first century.  First, the declassification and release of this material will help the victims of chemical and biological warfare experimentation carried out by the Japanese Army during the Second World War, as well as their families and descendants, gain information about what occurred to them fifty years ago. If old wounds are to heal, there must be a full accounting of what happened.  Second, and perhaps just as importantly, this legislation is intended to create an environment of honest dialogue and discussion in the Asia-Pacific region, so that the countries and people of the region can move beyond the problems that have plagued us for the past century, and work together to build a peaceful and prosperous Asian-Pacific community in the next century.  If the countries of Asia are to build a peaceful community it is necessary that we deal fully, fairly, and honestly with the past. It is only by doing so that we can avoid repeating the mistakes of the past and build a more just world for the future.  Indeed, as Rabbi Abraham Cooper has remarked, ``Since the end of World War II, professed neutral nations like Sweden and Switzerland have had the courage to take a painful look back at their World War II record; can Japan be allowed to do anything less?''  I hope that my colleagues will join me in support of this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the October 7 letter by Professor Harris and an article outlining some of the scholarly research on this issue: ``Japan's Biological Weapons: 1930-1945,'' by Robert Gromer, John Powell, and Burt Roling be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                            Granada Hills, CA,                                                  October 7, 1999.     Hon. Senator Dianne Feinstein,     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: Several Asian American activists      organizations in California, and organizations representing      former Prisoners of War and Internees of the Japanese      Imperial Army, have indicated to me that you are proposing to      introduce legislation into the United States Senate that      calls for full disclosure by the United States Government of      records it possesses concerning war crimes committed by      members of the Japanese Imperial Army. I endorse such      legislation enthusiastically.       My support for the full disclosure of American held records      relating to the Japanese Imperial Army's wartime crimes      against humanity is both personal and professional. I am      aware of the terrible suffering members of the Imperial      Japanese Army imposed upon innocent Asians, prisoners of war      of various nationalists and civilian internees of Allied      nations. These inhumane acts were condoned, if not ordered,      by the highest authorities in both the civilian and military      branches of the Japanese government. As a consequence,      millions of persons were killed, maimed, tortured, or      experienced acts of violence that included human experiments      relating to biological and chemical warfare research. Many of      these actions meet the definition of ``war crimes'' under      both the Potsdam Declaration and the various Nuremberg War      Crimes trials held in the post-war period.       I am the author of ``Factories of Death, Japanese      Biological Warfare, 1932-45, and the American Cover-up''      (Routlege: London and New York; hard cover edition 1994;      paperback printings, 1995, 1997, 1998, 1999). I discovered in      the course of my research for this book, and scholarly      articles that I published on the subject of Japanese      biological and chemical warfare preparations, that members of      the Japanese Imperial Army Medical Corps committed heinous      war crimes. These included involuntary laboratory tests of      various pathogens on humans--Chinese, Korean, other Asian      nationalities, and Allied prisoners of war, including      Americans. Barbarous acts encompassed live vivisections,      amputations of body parts (frequently without the use of      anesthesia), frost bite exposure to temperatures of 40-50      degrees Fahrenheit below zero, injection of horse blood and      other animal blood into humans, as well as other horrific      experiments. When a test was completed, the human      experimented was ``sacrificed'', the euphemism used by      Japanese scientists as a substitute term for ``killed.''       In my capacity as an academic Historian, I can testify to      the difficulty researchers have in unearthing documents and      personal testimony concerning these war crimes. I, and other      researchers, have been denied access to military archives in      Japan. These archives cover activities by the Imperial      Japanese Army that occurred more than 50 years ago. The      documents in question cannot conceivably contain information      that would be considered of importance to ``National      Security'' today. The various governments in Japan for the      past half century have kept these archives firmly closed. The      fear is that the information contained in the archives will      embarrass previous governments.       Here in the United States, despite the Freedom of      Information Act, some archives remain closed to      investigators. At best, the archivists in charge, or the      Freedom of Information Officer at the archive in question,      select what documents they will allow to become public. This      is an unconscionable act of arrogance and a betrayal of the      trust they have been given by the Congress and the     President of the United States. Moreover, ``sensitive''      documents--as defined by archivists and FOIA officers--are at      the moment being destroyed. Thus, historians and concerned      citizens are being denied factual evidence that can shed some      light on the terrible atrocities committed by Japanese      militarists in the past.       Three examples of this wanton destruction should be      sufficiently illustrative of the dangers that exist, and      should reinforce the obvious necessity for prompt passage of      legislation you propose to introduce into the Congress:       1. In 1991, the Librarian at Dugway Proving Grounds,      Dugway, Utah, denied me access to the archives at the      facility. It was only through the intervention of then U.S.      Representative Wayne Owens, Dem., Utah, that I was given      permission to visit the facility. I was not shown all the      holdings relating to Japanese medical experiments, but the      little I was permitted to examine revealed a great deal of      information about medical war crimes. Sometimes after my      visit, a person with intimate knowledge of Dugway's      operations, informed me that ``sensitive'' documents were      destroyed there as a direct result of my research in their      library.       2. I conducted much of my American research at Fort Detrick      in Frederick, Md. The Public Information Officer there was      extremely helpful to me. Two weeks ago I telephoned Detrick,      was informed that the PIO had retired last May. I spoke with      the new PIO, who told me that Detrick no longer would discuss      past research activities, but would disclose information only      on current projects. Later that day I telephoned the retired      PIO at his home. He informed me that upon retiring he was      told to ``get rid of that stuff'', meaning incriminating      documents relating to Japanese medical war crimes. Detrick no      longer is a viable research center for historians.       3. Within the past 2 weeks, I was informed that the      Pentagon, for ``space reasons'', decided to rid itself of all      biological warfare documents in its holdings prior to 1949.      The date is important, because all war crimes trials against      accused Japanese war criminals were terminated by 1949. Thus,      current Pentagon materials could not implicate alleged      Japanese war criminals. Fortunately, a private research      facility in Washington volunteered to retrieve the documents      in question. This research facility now holds the documents,      is currently cataloguing them (estimated completion time, at      least twelve months), and is guarding the documents under      ``tight security.''       Your proposed legislation must be acted upon promptly. Many      of the victims of Japanese war crimes are elderly. Some of      the victims pass away daily. Their suffering should receive      recognition and some compensation. Moreover, History is being      cheated. As documents disappear, the story of war crimes      committed in the War In The Pacific becomes increasingly      difficult to describe. The end result will be a distorted      picture of reality. As an Historian, I cannot accept this      inevitability without vigorous protest.       Please excuse the length of this letter. However, I do hope      that some of the arguments I made in comments above will be      of some assistance to you as you press for passage of the      proposed legislation. I will be happy to be of any additional      assistance to you, should you wish to call upon me for      further information or documentation.           Sincerely yours,                                            Sheldon H. Harris,                                    Professor of History emeritus,     California State University, Northridge.                                  ____        [From the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Oct., 1981]   Japan's Biological Weapons: 1930-1945--A Hidden Chapter in History         (By Robert Gomer, John W. Powell and Bert V.A. Roling)       When this story first reached the Bulletin, our reaction      was horrified disbelief. I think all of us hoped that it was      not true. Unfortunately, subsequent research shows that it is      all too true. In order to verify the facts set forth here we      enlisted the help of a number of distinguished scientists and      historians, who are hereby thanked. It seems unnecessary to      mention them by name; suffice it that the allegations set      forth in this article seem to be true and there is a      substantial file of documents in the Bulletin offices to back      them up.       What other comment need one really make? Any reader with a      sense of justice and decency will be nauseated, not only by      these atrocities, but equally so by the reaction of the U.S.      Departments of War and State.       The psychological climate engendered by war is horrible.      The Japanese tortured and killed helpless prisoners in search      of ``a cheap and effective weapon.'' The Americans and      British invented firestorms and the U.S. dropped two nuclear      bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In such a climate it may      have seemed reasonable not to bring the Japanese responsible      for the biological ``experiments'' to justice, but it was and      remains monstrous.       By acquiring ``at a fraction of the original cost'' the      ``invaluable'' results of the Japanese experiments, have we      not put ourselves on the same level as the Japanese      experimenters? Some politicians and generals like to speak of      the harsh realities of the world in order to act both      bestially and stupidly. The world clearly does contain harsh      realities but somehow there is a sort of potential divine      justice basic decency generally would have been the      smartest course in the long run. Unfortunately there are      few instances where it was actually taken.       The spirit and psychological climate which made possible      the horrors described in this article are not dead; in fact,      they seem to be flourishing in the world. The torture      chambers are busy in Latin America and elsewhere, and the      United States provides economic and military aid to the      torturers. The earth-and-people destroying was waged by the      United States not long ago in Vietnam, the apparently similar      war being waged by the Soviets in Afghanistan, the horrors of      the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia, and the contemplation with      some equanimity of ``limited'' nuclear war by strategists      here and in the Soviet Union display the spirit of General      Ishii. If we are to survive as human beings, or more      accurately, if we are to become fully human, that spirit must      have no place among men.--Robert Gomer (professor of      chemistry at the University of Chicago, and member of the      Board of Directors of the Bulletin.)       Long-secret documents, secured under the U.S. Freedom of      Information Act, reveal details of one of the more gruesome      chapters of the Pacific War; Japan's use of biological      warfare against China and the Soviet Union. For years the      Japanese and American governments succeeded in suppressing      this story.       Japan's desire to hide its attempts at ``public health in      reverse'' is understandable. The American government's      participation in the cover-up, it is now disclosed, stemmed      from Washington's desire to secure exclusive possession of      Japan's expertise in using germs as lethal weapons. The      United States granted immunity from war crimes prosecution to      the Japanese participants, and they in turn handed over their      laboratory records to U.S. representatives from Camp Detrick      (now Fort Detrick).       The record shows that by the late 1930s Japan's biological      warfare (BW) program was ready for testing. It was used with      moderate success against Chinese troops and civilians and      with unknown results against the Russians. By 1945 Japan had      a huge stockpile of germs, vectors and delivery equipment      unmatched by any other nation.       Japan had gained this undisputed lead primarily because its      scientists used humans as guinea pigs. It is estimated that      at least 3,000 people were killed at the main biological      warfare experimental station, code named Unit 731 and located      a few miles from Harbin. They either succumbed during the      experiments or were executed when they had become physical      wrecks and were no longer fit for further germ tests [1, pp.      19-21]. There is no estimate of total casualties but it is      known that at least two other Japanese biological warfare      installations--Unit 100 near Changchun and the Tama      Detachment in Nanjing--engaged in similar human      experimentation.       (End Notes at end of articles)       This much of the story has been available for some years.      What has not been known until very recently is that among the      human guinea pigs were an undetermined number of American      soldiers, captured during the early part of the war and      confined in prisoner-of-war camps in Manchuria. Official U.S.      reports reveal that Washington was aware of these facts when      the decision was made to forego prosecution of the Japanese      participants. These declassified ``top secret'' documents      disclose the details and raise disturbing questions about the      role of numerous highly placed American officials at the      time.       The first public indications that American prisoners of war      were among the human victims appeared in the published      summary of the Khabarovsk trial. A witness stated that a      researcher was sent to the camps where U.S. prisoners were      held to ``study the immunity of Anglo-Saxons to infectious      diseases'' [1, p. 268]. The summary noted: ``As early as      1943, Minata, a researcher belonging to Detachment 731, was      sent to prisoner of war camps to test the properties of the      blood and immunity to contagious diseases of American      soldiers'' [1, p. 415].       On June 7, 1947, Colonel Alva C. Carpenter, chief of      General Douglas MacArthur's legal staff, in a top secret      cable to Washington, expressed doubt about the reliability of      early reports of Japanese biological warfare, including an      allegation by the Japanese Communist Party that experiments      had been performed ``on captured Americans in Mukden and that      simultaneously research on similar lines was conducted in      Tokyo and Kyoto.'' On June 27, Carpenter again cabled      Washington, stating that further information strengthened the      charges and ``warrants conclusion'' that the Ishii group had      violated the ``rules of land warfare.'' He warned that the      Soviets might bring up evidence of Japanese use of biological      warfare against China and ``other evidence on this subject      which may have resulted from their independent investigation      in Manchuria and in Japan.'' He added that ``this expression      of opinion'' was not a recommendation that Ishii's group be      charged with war crimes.       Cecil F. Hubbert, a member of the State, War, Navy      Coordinating Committee, in a July 15, 1947 memo, recommended      that the story be covered up but warned that it might leak      out if the Russian prosecutor brought the subject up during      the Tokyo war crimes trials and added that the Soviets might      have found out that ``American prisoners of war were used for      experimental purposes of a bw nature and that they lost their      lives as a result of these experiments.''       In his book, The Pacific War Professor Ienaga Saburo added      a few new details about Unit 731 and described fatal      vivisection experiments at Kyushu Imperial University on      downed American fliers [2, pp. 188-90].       The biological warfare project began shortly after the      Manchurian Incident in 1931, when Japan occupied China's      Northeast provinces and when a Japanese Army surgeon, Ishii      Shiro, persuaded his superiors that microbes could become an      inexpensive weapon potentially capable of producing enormous      casualties [1, pp. 105-107; 3]. Ishii, who finally rose to      the rank of lieutenant-general, built a large, self-contained      installation with sophisticated germ- and insect-breeding      facilities, a prison for the human experimentees, testing      grounds, an arsenal for makin germ bombs, an airfield, its      own special planes and a crematorium for the human victims.       When Soviet tanks crossed the Siberian-Manchurian border at      midnight on August 8, 1945, Japan was less than a week away      from unconditional surrender. In those few days of grace the      Japanese destroyed their biological warfare installations in      China, killed the remaining human experimentees (``It took 30      hours to lay them in ashes [4]'') and ship out most of their      personnel and some of the more valuable equipment to South      Korea [1, pp. 43, 125, 130-31]. Reports that some equipment      was slipped into Japan are confirmed by American documents      which reveal that slides, laboratory records and case      histories of experiments over many years were successfully      transported to Japan [4].       A ``top secret'' cable from Tokyo to Washington on May 6,      1947, described some of the information being secured:       ``Statements obtained from Japanese here confirm statements      of ussr prisoners. . . Experiments on humans were . . .      described by three Japanese and confirmed tacitly by Ishii;      field trials against Chinese took place . . . scope of      program indicated by report . . . that 400 kilograms [880      lbs.] of dried anthrax organisms destroyed in August 1945. .      . . Reluctant statements by Ishii indicate he had superiors      (possibly general staff) who . . . authorized the program.      Ishii states that if guaranteed immunity from ``war crimes''      in documentary form for himself, superiors and subordinates,      he can describe program in detail. Ishii claims to have      extensive theoretical high-level knowledge including      strategic and tactical use of BW on defense and offense,      backed by some research on best agents to employ by      geographical areas of Far East, and the use of BW in cold      climates'' [5, 6].       A top secret Tokyo headquarters ``memorandum for the      record'' (also dated May 6), gave more details: ``USSR      interest in Japanese BW personnel arises from interrogations      of two captured Japanese formerly associated with BW. Copies      of these interrogations were given to U.S. Preliminary      investigation[s] confirm authenticity of USSR interrogations      and indicate Japanese activity in:       a. Human experiments       b. Field trials against Chinese       c. Large scale program       d. Research on BW by crop destruction       e. Possible that Japanese General Staff knew and authorized      program       f. Thought and research devoted to strategic and tactical      use of BW.       Data . . . on above topics are of great intelligence value      to U.S. Dr. Fell, War Department representative, states that      this new evidence was not known by U.S. [6].       Certain low echelon Japanese are now working to assemble      most of the necessary technical data. . . . Information to      the present have [sic] been obtained by persuasion,      exploitation of Japanese fear of USSR and Japanese desire to      cooperate with U.S. Additional information . . . probably can      be obtained by informing Japanese involved that information      will be kept in intelligence channels and not employed for      `war crimes' evidence.       Documentary immunity from ``war crimes'' given to higher      echelon personnel involved will result in exploiting twenty      years experience of the director, former General Ishii, who      can assure complete cooperation of his former subordinates,      indicate the connection of the Japanese General Staff and      provide the tactical and strategic information'' [7].       A report on December 12, 1947, by Dr. Edwin V. Hill, chief,      Basic Sciences, Camp Detrick, Maryland, described some of the      technical data secured from the Japanese during an official      visit to Tokyo by Hill and Dr. Joseph Victor [8].      Acknowledging the ``wholehearted cooperation of Brig. Gen.      Charles A. Willoughby,'' MacArthur's intelligence chief, Hill      wrote that the objectives were to obtain additional material      clarifying reports already submitted by the Japanese, ``to      examine human pathological material which had been      transferred to Japan from BW installations,'' and ``to obtain      protocols necessary for understanding the significance of the      pathological material.''       Hill and Victor interviewed a number of Japanese experts      who were already assembling biological warfare archival      material and writing reports for the United States. They      checked the results of experiments with various specific      human, animal and plant diseases, and investigated Ishii's      system for spreading disease via aerosol from planes. Dr. Ota      Kiyoshi described his anthrax experiments, including the      number of people infected and the number who died Ishii      reported on his experiments with botulism and brucellosis.      Drs. Hayakawa Kiyoshi and Yamanouchi Yujiro gave Hill and      Victor the results of other brucellosis tests, including the      number of human casualties.       Hill pointed out that the material was a financial bargain,      was obtainable nowhere else, and concluded with a plea on      behalf of Ishii and his colleagues:       ``Specific protocols were obtained from individual      investigators. Their descriptions of experiments are detailed      in separate reports. These protocols . . . indicate the      extent of experimentation with infectious diseases in human      and plant species.       Evidence gathered . . . has greatly supplemented and      amplified previous aspects of this field. It represents data      which have been obtained by Japanese scientists at the      expenditure of many millions of dollars and years of work.      Information has accrued with respect to human susceptibility      to those diseases as indicated by specific infectious doses      of bacteria. Such information could not be obtained in our      own laboratories because of scruples attached to human      experimentation. These data were secured with a total outlay      of Y [yen] 250,000 to date, a mere pittance by comparison      with the actual cost of the studies.       Furthermore, the pathological material which has been      collected constitutes the only material evidence of the      nature of these experiments. It is hoped that individuals who      voluntarily contributed this information will be spared      embarrassment because of it and that every effort will be      taken to prevent this information from falling into other      hands.''       A memo by Dr. Edward Wetter and Mr. H.I. Stubblefield,      dated July 1, 1947, for restricted circulation to military      and State Department officials also described the nature and      quantity of material which Ishii was beginning to supply, and      noted some of the political issues involved [9]. They      reported that Ishii and his colleagues were cooperating      fully, were preparing voluminous reports, and had agreed to      supply photographs of ``selected examples of 8,000 slides      of tissues from autopsies of humans and animals subjected      to BW experiments.'' Human experiments, they pointed out,      were better than animal experiments:       ``This Japanese information is the only known source of      data from scientifically controlled experiments showing the      direct effect of BW agents on man. In the past it has been      necessary to evaluate the effects of BW agents on man from      data obtained through animal experimentation. Such evaluation      is inconclusive and far less complete than results obtained      from certain types of human experimentation.''       Wetter and Stubblefield also stated that the Soviet Union      was believed to be in possession of ``only a small portion of      this technical information'' and that since ``any `war      crimes' trial would completely reveal such data to all      nations, it is felt that such publicity must be avoided in      the interests of defense and national security of the U.S.''      They emphasized that the knowledge gained by the Japanese      from their human experiments ``will be of great value to the      U.S. BW research program'' and added: ``The value to U.S. of      Japanese BW data is of such importance to national security      as to far outweigh the value accruing from war crimes      prosecution.''       A July 15 response to the Wetter-Stubblefield memo by Cecil      F. Hubbert, a member of the State, War, Navy Coordinating      Committee, agreed with its recommendations but warned of      potential complications because ``experiments on human beings      . . . have been condemned as war crimes by the International      Military Tribunal'' in Germany and that the United States      ``is at present prosecuting leading German scientists and      medical doctors at Nuremberg for offenses which included      experiments on human beings which resulted in the suffering      and death of most of those experimented upon'' [10].       Hubbert raised the possibility that the whole thing might      leak out if the Soviets were to bring it up in cross-     examining major Japanese war criminals at the Tokyo trial and      cautioned:       ``It should be kept in mind that there is a remote      possibility that independent investigation conducted by the      Soviets in the Mukden area may have disclosed evidence that      American prisoners-of-war were used for experimental purposes      of a BW nature and that they lost their lives as a result of      these experiments.''       Despite these risks, Hubbert concurred with the Wetter-     Stubblefield recommendation that the issue be kept secret and      that the Japanese biological warfare personnel be given      immunity in return for their cooperation. He suggested some      changes for the final position paper, including the following      casuistry: ``The data on hand . . . does not appear      sufficient at this time to constitute a basis for sustaining      a war crimes charge against Ishii and/or his associates.''       Hubbert returned to the subject in a memorandum written      jointly with E.F. Lyons, Jr., a member of the Plans and      Policy Section of the War Crimes Branch. This top secret      document stated, in part:       ``The Japanese BW group is the only known source of data      from scientifically controlled experiments showing direct      effects of BW agents on humans. In addition, considerable      valuable data can be obtained from this group regarding BW      experiments on animals and food crops. . . .       Because of the vital importance of the Japanese BW      information . . . the Working Group, State-War-Navy      Coordinating Sub-     committee for the Far East, are in agreement that the      Japanese BW group should be informed that this Government      would retain in intelligence channels all information given      by the group on the subject of BW. This decision was made      with full consideration of and in spite of the following:       (a) That its practical effect is that this Government will      not prosecute any members of the Japanese BW group for War      Crimes of a BW nature.       (b) That the Soviets may be independent investigation      disclose evidence tending to establish or connect Japanese BW      activities with a war crime, which evidence the Soviets may      attempt to introduce at the International Military Trial now      pending at Tokyo.       (c) That there is a remote possibility that the evidence      which may be disclosed by the Soviets would include evidence      that American prisoners of war were used for experimental      purposes by the Japanese BW group'' [11].       In the intervening years the evidence that captured      American soldiers were among the human guinea pigs used by      Ishii in his lethal germ experiments remained ``closely      held'' in the top echelons of the U.S. government. A      ``confidential'' March 13, 1956, Federal Bureau of      Investigation internal memorandum, addressed to the      ``Director, FBI (105-12804)'' from ``SAC, WFO (105-1532)''      stated in part:       ``Mr. James J. Kelleher, Jr., Office of Special Operations,      DOD [Department of Defense], has volunteered further comments      to the effect that American Military Forces after occupying      Japan, determined that the Japanese actually did experiment      with ``BW'' agents in Manchuria during 1943-44 using American      prisoners as test victims. . . . Kelleher added that . . .      information of the type in question is closely controlled and      regarded as highly sensitive.''       It is perhaps not surprising that it has taken so long for      the full story to be revealed. Over the years fragments have      occasionally leaked out, but each time were met with      denials, initially by the Japanese and later by the United      States. During the Korean War when China accused the      United States of employing updated versions of Japan's      earlier biological warfare tactics, not only were the      charges denied, but it was also claimed that there was no      proof of the earlier Japanese actions.       At the time of the Khabarovsk trial, the United States was      pressing the Soviet Union to return thousands of Japanese      prisoners held in Siberian labor camps since the end of World      War II. When news of the trial reached Tokyo, it was      dismissed as ``propaganda.'' William J. Sebald, MacArthur's      diplomatic chief, was quoted in a United Press story in the      Nippon Times on December 29, 1949, as saying the story of the      trial might just be fiction and that it obviously was a      ``smoke screen'' to obscure the fact that the Soviets had      refused to account for the missing Japanese prisoners.       It is possible that some of Ishii's attacks went      undetected, either because they were failures or because the      resulting outbreaks of disease were attributed to natural      causes by the Chinese. However, some were recognized.      Official archives of the People's Republic of China list 11      cities as subjected to biological warfare attacks, while the      number of victims of artificially disseminated plague alone      is placed at approximately 700 between 1940 and 1944 [12, p.      11].       A few of the Chinese allegations received international      press coverage at the time. The Chinese Nationalists claimed      that on October 27, 1940, plague was dropped on Ningbo, a      city near Shanghai. The incident was not investigated in a      scientific way, but the observed facts aroused suspicion.      Something was seen to come out of a Japanese plane. Later,      there was a heavy infestation of fleas and 99 people came      down with bubonic plague, with all but one dying. Yet the      rats in the city did not have plague, and traditionally,      outbreaks of plague in the human population follow an      epizootic in the rat population.       In the next few years a number of other Japanese biological      warfare attacks were alleged by the Chinese. Generally, they      were based on similar cause and effect observations. One      incident, however, was investigated with more care.       On the morning of November 4, 1941, a Japanese plane      circled low over Changde, a city in Hunan Province. Instead      of the usual cargo of bombs, the plane dropped grains of      wheat and rice, pieces of paper and cotton wadding, which      fell in two streets in the city's East Gate District.      During the next three weeks six people living on the two      streets died, all with symptoms suggesting plague. Dr.      Chen Wen-kwei, a former League of Nations plague expert in      India, arrived with a medical team just as the last victim      died. He performed the autopsy, found symptoms of plague      which were confirmed by culture and animal tests. Again,      there was no plague outbreak in the rat population [12,      pp. 195-204].       On March 31, 1942, the Nationalist government stated that a      follow-up investigation by Dr. Robert K.S. Lim, Director of      the Chinese Red Cross, and Dr. R. Politzer, internationally      known epidemiologist and former member of the League of      Nations Anti-Epidemic Commission, who was then on a wartime      assignment to the Chinese government, had confirmed Chen's      findings.       Western reaction to the Chinese charges was mixed. Harrison      Forman of the New York Times, and Dr. Thomas Parran, Jr., the      U.S. Surgeon-General, thought the Chinese had made a case.      But U.S. Ambassador Clarence E. Gauss was uncertain in an      April 11, 1942, cable to the State Department, while Dr.      Theodor Rosebury, the well-known American bacteriologist,      felt that failure to produce plague bacilli from cultures of      the material dropped at Changde weakened the Chinese claim      [13, pp. 109-10]. Chen's full report, in which he suggested      that it was fleas that were infected rather than the other      material, was not made readily available by the Nationalist      government.       Later disclosures of Japanese techniques would support      Chen's reasoning: Fleas, after being fed on plague-infected      rats, were swaddled in cotton and wrapped in paper, while      grain was included in the mix in the hope that it would      attract rats so that the fleas would find a new host to      infect and thus start a ``natural'' epidemic.       At the December 1949 Soviet trial at Khabarovsk evidence      was produced supporting the Nationalist Chinese biological      warfare charges [14]. Witnesses testified that films had been      made of some tests, including the 1940 attack on Ningbo.      Japanese witnesses and defendants confirmed other biological      warfare attacks, such as the 1941 Changde incident. Military      orders, railroad waybills for shipment of biological warfare      supplies, gendarmerie instructions for sending prisoners to      the laboratories, and other incriminating Japanese documents      were introduced in evidence [1, pp. 19-20, 23-24].       Describing the operation of Unit 731, the main biological      warfare installation, located outside Harbin, the transcript      summary stated: ``Experts have calculated . . . that it was      capable of breeding, in the course of one production cycle,      lasting only a few days, no less than 30,000,000 billion      microbes. . . . That explains why . . . bacteria quantities      [are given] in kilograms, thus referring to the weight of      the thick, creamy bacteria mass skimmed directly from the      surface of the culture medium [1, pp. 13-14].       Total bacteria production capacity at this one unit was      eight tons per month [1, pp. 266-67].       Euphemistically called a ``water purification unit,''      General Ishii's organization also worked on medical projects      not directly related to biological warfare. In the Asian      countries it overran, the Japanese Army conscripted local      young women to entertain the troops. The medical difficulties      resulting from this practice became acute. In an effort to      solve the problem, Chinese women confined in the detachment's      prison ``were infected with syphillis with the object of      investigating preventive means against this disease. [1, p.      357].       Another experiment disclosed at the Khabarovsk trial was      the ``freezing project.'' During extremely cold winter      weather prisoners were led outdoors:       ``Their arms were bared and made to freeze with the help of      an artificial current of air. This was done until their      frozen arms, when struck with a short stick, emitted a sound      resembling that which a board gives out when it is struck''      [1, pp. 289, 21-22, 357-58].       Once back inside, various procedures for thawing were      tried. One account of Unit 731's prison, adjacent to the      laboratories, described men and women with rotting hands from      which the bones protruded--victims of the freezing tests. A      documentary film was made of one of the experiments.       Simulated field tests were carried out at Unit 731's Anta      Station Proving Ground. Witnesses described experiments in      which various infecting agents were used. Nishi Toshihide,      Chief of the Training Division, testified:       ``In January 1945 . . . I saw experiments in inducing gas      gangrene, conducted under the direction of the Chief of the      2nd Division, Col. Ikari, and researcher Futaki. Ten      prisoners . . . were tied facing stakes, five to ten metres      apart. . . . The prisoners' heads were covered with metal      helmets, and their bodies with screens . . . only the naked      buttocks being exposed. At about 100 metres away a      fragmentation bomb was exploded by electricity. . . . All ten      men were wounded . . . and sent back to the prison. . . . I      later asked Ikari and research Futaki what the results had      been. They told me that all ten men had . . . died of gas      gangrene.'' [1, pp. 289-90].       Among the many wartime recollections published by Japanese      exservicemen are a few by former members of Unit 731 [15].      Akiyama Hiroshi told his story in two magazine articles and      Kimura Bumpei, a former captain, has published his memoirs      [16]. Sakaki Ryohei, a former major, has described how      plague was spread by air-dropping rats and voles and has      given details of the flea ``nurseries'' developed by Ishii      for rapid production of millions of fleas [17].       A more dramatic confirmation of Ishii's work was an hour-     long Japanese television documentary produced by Yoshinaga      Haruko and shown by the Tokyo Broadcasting System. A      Washington Post dispatch on November 19, 1976, reported:       ``In the little-publicized television documentary on the      germ warfare unit, Yoshinaga laid bare secrets closely held      in Japan during and since the war. . . . [She] traveled      throughout Japan to trace down 20 former members of the      wartime unit. . . . Four of the men finally agreed to help,      and the reporter found their testimony dovetailed with      reports of war crime trials held in the Soviet Union.''       Some of those interviewed by Yoshinaga claimed that they      had told their stories to American authorities. Eguchi said      that he ``was the second to be ordered to G.H.Q. [General      Headquarters]'' and ``they took a     record'' of his testimony. Takahashi, an ex-surgeon and Army      major, stated: ``I went to the G.H.Q. twice in 1947.      Investigators made me write reports on the condition that      they will protect me from the Soviets.'' Kumamoto, an ex-     flight engineer, said that after the war General Ishii went      to America and ``took his research data and begged for      remission for us all'' [4].       Declassified position papers indicate a difference of      opinion on how to deal with the question of immunity. The War      Department favored acceding to Ishii's demands for immunity      in documentary form. The State Department, however, cautioned      against putting anything in writing which might later cause      embarrassment, arguing that if the Japanese were told the      information would be kept in classified intelligence channels      that would be sufficient protection. In any event, a      satisfactory arrangement apparently was worked out as none of      the biological warfare personnel was subsequently charged      with war crimes and the United States obtained full details      of Japan's program.       The Japanese experts who, Dr. Hill hoped, would ``be spared      embarrassment,'' not only used their human guinea pigs in      experiments to determine lethal dosages but on occasion--in      their pursuit of exact scientific information--made certain      that the experimentees did not survive. A group would be      brought down with a disease and, as the infection developed,      individuals would be selected out of the group and killed.      Autopsies were then performed, so that the progress of the      disease could be ascertained at various time-frames.       General Kitano Masaji and Dr. Kasahara Shiro revealed this      practice in a report prepared for U.S. officials describing      their work on hemorrhagic fever:       ``Subsequent cases were produced either by blood or blood-     free extracts of liver, spleen or kidney derived from      individuals sacrificed at various times during the course of      the disease. Morphine was employed for this purpose'' [18].       Kitano and Dr. Kasahara Yukio described the ``sacrificing''      of a human experimentee when he apparently was recovering      from an attack of tick encephalitis:       ``Mouse brain suspension . . . was injected . . . and      produced symptoms after an incubation period of 7 days.      Highest temperature was 39.8 deg. C. This subject was      sacrificed when fever was subsiding, about the 12th day.''       Clearly, U.S. biological warfare experts learned a lot from      their Japanese counterparts. While we do not yet know exactly      how much this information advanced the American program, we      have the Fort Detrick doctors' testimony that it was      ``invaluable.'' And it is known that some of the biological      weapons developed later were at least similar to ones that      had been part of the Japanese project. Infecting feathers      with spore diseases was one of Ishii's achievements and      feather bombs later became a weapon in America's biological      warfare arsenal [19].       Dr. Leroy D. Fothergill, long-time scientific advisor to      the U.S. Army's Biological Laboratories at Fort Detrick, once      speculated upon some of the possible spin-off effects of a      biological warfare attack:       ``Everything that breathes in the exposed area has an      opportunity to be exposed to the agent. This will involve      vast numbers of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and      insects. . . . Surveys have indicated surprising numbers of      wild life inhabiting each square mile of countryside. It is      possible that many species would be exposed to an agent for      the first time in their evolutionary history . . . Would it      create the basis for possible genetic evolution of      microorganisms in new directions with changes in virulence of      some species? Would it establish public health and      environmental problems that are unique and beyond our present      experience?'' [20].       Perhaps President Richard Nixon had some of these things in      mind when, on November 25, 1969, he renounced the use of      biological warfare, declaring:       ``Biological weapons have massive unpredictable and      potentially uncontrollable consequences. They may produce      global epidemics and impair the health of future generations.      I have therefore decided that the U.S. shall renounce the use      of lethal biological agents and weapons, and all other      methods of biological warfare'' [21].       Some research on defensive aspects was permitted by the      ban. The line between defense and offense is admittedly a      thin one. Nearly a year after the Nixon renunciation of      biological warfare, Seymour Hersh wrote that the programs the      Army wanted to continue ``under defensive research included a      significant effort to develop and produce virulent strains of      new biological agents, then develop defenses against them.      `This sounds very much like what we were doing before,' one      official noted caustically'' [22].       There is a difference of opinion among observers as to      whether the United States and other major powers have indeed      given up on biological warfare. Some believe the issue is a      matter of the past. However, its history has been so replete      with deception that one cannot be sure. One thing seems      certain: The story did not end with Japan's use of biological      war fare against China; there are additional chapters to be      written.       Available documents do not reveal whether anyone knows the      names of any of the thousands of Chinese Mongolians,      Russians, ``half-breeds'' and Americans whose lives were      prematurely ended by massive doses of plague, typhus,      dysenteries, gas gangrene, typhoid, hemorrhagic fever,      cholera, anthax, tularemia, smallpox, tsutsugamushi and      glanders; or by such grotesqueries as being pumped full of      horse blood; having their livers destroyed by prolonged      exposure to X-rays or being subjected to vivisection.       It is known, however, that because of the ``national      security'' interests of the United States, General Ishii and      many of the top members of Unit 731 lived out their full      lives, suffering only the natural afflictions of old age. A      few, General Kitano among them, enjoyed exceptional good      health and at the time of writing were living in quiet      retirement.         General Headquarters, Supreme Commander for the Allied            Powers,                                                       Mar 27, 47.                      Brief for the Chief of Staff       1. This has to do with Russian requests for transfer of the      former Japanese expert in Bacteriological Warfare.       2. The United States has primary interest, has already      interrogated this man and his information is held by the U.S.      Chemical Corps classified as TOP SECRET.       3. The Russian has made several attempts to get at this      man. We have stalled. He now hopes to make his point by      suddenly claiming the Japanese expert as a war criminal.       4. Joint Chiefs of Staff direct that this not be done but      concur in a SCAP controlled interrogation requiring expert      assistance not available in FEC.       5.

Karazawai affidavit in para      3 below confirms this as Ishii Detachment experiment. 97      plague fatalities.       2. Strong circumstantial evidence exists of use of bacteria      warfare at Chuhsien, Kinghwa and Changteh. At Chuhsien      Japanese planes scattered rice and wheat grains mixed with      fleas on 4th October 1940. Bubonic plague appeared in same      area on 12th November. Plague never occurred in Chuhsien      before occurrence. Fleas were not properly examined to      determine whether plague infected. At Kinghwa, located      between Ningpo and Chupuien, 3 Japanese planes dropped a      large quantity of small granules on 28th November 1940.      Microscopic examination revealed presence of numerous gram-     negative bacilli possessing * * *.                           *   *   *   *   *                             A Judge's View                         (By Bert V.A. Roling)       As one of the judges in the International Military Tribunal      for the Far East, it is a bitter experience for me to be      informed now that centrally ordered Japanese war criminality      of the most disgusting kind was kept secret from the Court by      the U.S. government. This Japanese war criminality consisted,      in part, of using human beings, prisoners of war, Chinese as      well as American, as ``guinea pigs'' in an endeavor to test      the impact of specific biological warfare weapons. Research      on and production of these weapons was not forbidden at that      time. The Protocol of Geneva, 1925, forbade their use only in      battle. But to use human beings for biological experiments,      causing the death of at least 3,000 prisoners of war, was      among the gravest war crimes.       The first information about these Japanese atrocities      became known through the trial at Khabarovsk, December 25 to      30, 1949. I remember reading about it [1], and not believing      its contents. I could not imagine that these things had      happened, without the Court in Tokyo being informed.      According to the book about the trial all the facts were      transmitted to the chief prosecutor, Joseph B. Keenan. But      some of the information was incorrect. The book mentions that      the Military Tribunal was informed of the wicked experiements      done by the Tama division in Nanking, and that it requested      the American prosecution to submit more detailed proof [1, p.      443]. Such Court procedures would not have been in conformity      with Anglo-Saxon practice. It is more likely that the      information was given to the chief prosecutor.       A further feature of the Khabarovsk book is the strange      character of the confessions made by the accused. Some are      quoted as saying that they acted upon the special secret      orders of the Japanese emperor [1, pp. 10, 519]. This was      bound to cause doubts about its credibility. The emperor does      not give orders to perform specific military acts. Everything      that is ordered by the government and its officials is ``in      the name of the emperor.'' But his role is remarkable in that      he may not make decisions; he has only to confirm decisions      of the government. The ``imperial will is decisive, but      it derives wholly from the government and the small circle      around the throne. Titus stresses the     ``ratification function'' of the reached consensus [2, p.      321]. It is clear that this imperial confirmation gives a      decision an exceptional authority: the command of the      emperor is obeyed. In fact, however, the emperor has a      kind of loud-speaker function. He is heard, and obeyed,      but he speaks only on the recommendation of the      government.       Very seldom does the emperor act in a personal manner. One      such occasion was his criticism of the behavior of the      Japanese army in Manchuria (the so-called Manchurian      Incident). Another related to his role in connection with the      capitulation at the end of World War II. Despite the atomic      bombs and the entry of the Soviet Union into the war, the      cabinet was divided and could not come to a decision because      the military members refused to surrender. Their motivation:      the existence of the imperial system was not sufficiently      guaranteed. In a very exceptional move, the emperor was      brought in to make the decision. He took the risk, and      decided for immediate capitulation.       Thus the emphasis on the personal secret involvement of the      emperor in the Khabarovsk trial account make it appear      untrustworthy. The whole setup could be perceived as a source      of arguments in favor of indicting the emperor. I remember at      that time, writing to show the danger of national postwar      judgments which could easily be misused for political      purposes, and giving the Khabarovsk trial as an example. I      must state now that the Japanese misbehavior as described in      the judgment, has been confirmed by the recently disclosed      American documents.       Immunity from prosecution was granted in exchange for      Japanese scientific findings concerning biological weapons,      based on disgusting criminal research on human beings. We      learn from these documents that it was considered a bargain:      almost for nothing, information was obtained that had cost      millions of dollars and thousands of human lives. The      American authorities were worrying only about the prospect of      the human outcry in the United States, which surely would      have taken place if the American people had been informed      about this ``deal.''       The security that surrounds the military makes it possible      for military behavior to deviate considerably from the      prevailing public standard, but it is a danger to society      when such deviation takes place. It leads gradually to      contempt for the military, as witness the public attitude in      connection with military behavior in the Vietnam war. The      kind of military behavior that occurred in connection with      the Japanese biological weapon atrocities can only contribute      further to this attitude.       Respect for what the Nuremberg judgment called ``the      honorable profession of arms'' is needed. Military power is      still indispensable in our present world to provide for peace      and security, so it is desirable for it to be held in high      esteem. Power which is despised may become dangerous.      Moreover, only if the military is regarded with respect, will      it attract the personnel it should have.       The same is true of diplomatic service, which needs      national and international respect. This respect will      disappear if the service indulges in subversive activities,      as the U.S. diplomatic mission did in Iran. That diplomatic      misbehavior in Iran led to developments--the hostage crisis--     which were disastrous for the whole world.       The documents which have come to light inform us also of      the use of biological weapons in the war against the Chinese      people. The criminal warfare was not mentioned in the Tokyo      indictment, and not discussed before the Military Tribunal.      It was kept secret from the world. The immunity granted to      the Japanese war criminals covered not only deadly research      on living persons, but also the use of biological weapons      against the Chinese. And all this so that the United States      could obtain exclusive access to the information, gained at      the cost of thousands of human lives.       Knowledge about what kind of bargain was being struck in      the biological weapons area may strengthen the perception of      the repulsiveness of war. It may also show the danger of      moral depravity, in peacetime, within the circles that have      the instruments of military power in their hands.                               end notes       1. Materials on the Trial of Former Servicemen of the      Japanese Army Charged with Manufacturing and Employing      Bacteriological Weapons (Moscow: Foreign Languages Publishing      House, 1950), pp. 19-21. This volume is a summary of the      transcript of the Soviet trial in Khabarovsk, Siberia, Dec.      20-25, 1949, of 12 captured Japanese Army personnel charged      with participation in the biological warfare program. For a      later reference to the program see Outline History of Science      and Technology in Japan, (``Nihon Kagaku Gijutsu-shi      Taikei''), Vol. 25 (Medicine 2, 1967), pp. 309-10. This      account states that the biological warfare program was      organized in 1933 and that ``for special research on      bacteria, members of the epidemic-prevention section shall be      sent to Manchuria.'' It also stated that little was known      about the program after the war since all records were said      to have been destroyed and that the only evidence was that      produced at the Khabarovsk trial. It did add, however, that      there were reports that General Ishii had avoided prosecution      by turning over his materials to U.S. authorities. I have not      seen this volume and am indebted to John Dower, of the      University of Wisconsin, who supplied the citation.       2.

Although most U.S. documents and the Soviet trial      summary give Ishii credit for originating the biological      warfare program, it is possible that he was only the chosen      instrument. There are references indicating interest in the      program at higher levels. The ``staff officer'' of Ishii's      Operations Division was Lieutenant Colonel Miyata, who in      real life was Prince Takeda [1, p. 40]. Ishii's friend at      court was Gen. Nagata Tetsuzan, long Japan's top military man      [1, pp. 106, 295], while the orders establishing the two      original units were reputedly issued by the Emperor [1, pp.      10, 104, 413].       4. ``A Bruise--Terror of the 731 Corps,'' Tokyo      Broadcasting System television documentary, produced by      Yoshinaga Haruko, shown Nov. 2, 1976. It has also been      screened in Europe but not in the United States. However, the      Washington Post (Nov. 19, 1976) carried a lengthy news story      describing the film. In an interview with Post reporter John      Saar, Yoshinaga said five former members of the biological      warfare unit told her they were promised complete protection      in return for cooperation with U.S. authorities. ``All the      important documents were given to the United States,'' she      said.       5. This ``top secret'' cable [C-52423] also reveals that      the first of the biological warfare experts to be sent from      Washington to Japan had already arrived, referring to ``Dr.      Norbert H. Fell's letters via air courier to General Alden C.      Waitt,'' who was then chief of the U.S. Army Chemical Corps.       6. Cable from Washington to Tokyo on April 2, 1947, stating      that Fell would leave for Japan on April 5. A cable from      Tokyo to the War Department on June 30, 1947, warns that an      ``aggressive prosecution will adversely affect U.S.      interests'' and urges that Fell (presumably now returned to      Washington) be shown recent cables because he is an expert      and can appreciate the value of the Japanese bw material.       7.
