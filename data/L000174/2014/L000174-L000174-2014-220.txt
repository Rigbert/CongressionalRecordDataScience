President, I have spoken several times in the past few weeks--and I have spoken many times in the past 20 years--about the scourge of landmines.  They are inherently indiscriminate weapons. They are triggered by the victim, and usually the victim is an innocent civilian who is either killed or horribly maimed.  The United States has not exported, produced, or used antipersonnel mines for more than 20 years. But notwithstanding that--even though 161 nations have joined the international treaty banning them--one nation stands out for not having joined the treaty. That is the United States, and it is a shame on this country.  As the world's only superpower with by far the most powerful military, one would have thought the United States would set an example of moral leadership. Instead, we are among those who are preventing the universality of the treaty.  This is doubly disappointing, considering that it was President Clinton who, 20 years ago, called for the elimination of antipersonnel mines. Two years later, in 1996--back in the last century--he said: ``Today I am launching an international effort to ban anti-personnel landmines.'' But his administration did not sign the treaty.  Then we had the Bush administration. They did nothing on the issue.  Now we have the Obama administration. Nothing has changed. The Obama administration is following the Bush administration's policy of doing nothing. So we are still waiting.  Last week I was in Vietnam, along with Senators Shelby and Crapo and Representatives Cooper from Tennessee and Welch from Vermont. We had conversations with President Sang, with the Minister of Defense, and other Vietnamese officials. But we also met with nongovernmental organizations--many of them Americans--that work to locate and clear landmines and other unexploded ordnance.  It is costly, dangerous work. They have been doing it for decades. At the current rate, when you consider that millions of landmines and bombs were dropped in Vietnam during the war, it is estimated that it will take another 100 years before it is safe to walk in that country without fear of triggering a deadly explosion.  I have met countless people in Vietnam who have been crippled and disfigured by landmines. Many of them are children the age of my grandchildren. Here is a photograph of two Vietnamese men I met last week. You can see what landmines do. My wife Marcelle and I were deeply touched when we spoke with them. After all the pain and hardship they have suffered, they were thanking us for helping to get them wheelchairs.  Their lives have been changed terribly forever, yet they are lucky because they survived. They lost their legs, their arms, but thankfully they are not among the tens of thousands who died from landmines during that war and in the decades since the war ended.  In Vietnam, we have used the Leahy War Victims Fund to provide medical care and rehabilitation to thousands of mine victims.  As a Democrat, I want to compliment a Republican President, George H.W. Bush, who worked with me and with the inspired founder of the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation, Bobby Muller, to start using the Leahy War Victims Fund in Vietnam.  We have spent many millions of dollars to help get rid of the mines. As I said earlier, 40 years after the war, there are still vast areas of Vietnam littered with unexploded mines and bombs.  Yet Vietnam is only one of dozens of countries whose people have been terrorized by landmines--some from our country, some from others.  When you talk to the Department of Defense about this, they say their mines are ``smart'' because they are designed to deactivate after a finite period of time. Of course, that is better than mines that remain active for years. But if a child steps on one before the time they are deactivated, that child does not know whether this is a smart mine or a dumb mine because as long as they are active, they are no better at distinguishing between a child and a soldier.  I remember the young woman I met in a hospital after the Bosnia war. She was sent away by her parents to be safe during that conflict. But when the war ended she was running down the road to greet her parents and had both legs blown off. The war was over, but it never ended for her.  I have never argued that mines have no military utility. Every weapon does. So does poison gas, so do IEDs. But we would not use them, and we consider it immoral for other people to use them. They are the antithesis of a precision weapon. They do not belong in the arsenal of civilized countries, least of all in the United States. The United States ought to have courage enough to sign the landmine treaty.  You have to wonder, if Pennsylvania or Oklahoma or Utah or Georgia or Vermont or New Jersey or any of our 50 States were littered with landmines, killing and maiming innocent Americans, would we tolerate it? Of course not. We would not make excuses about needing to use these weapons. The outcry would be deafening and the United States would join the treaty, as we should have 15 years ago.  Some might ask why this matters. The United States has not used mines for two decades, even while we fought two long land wars. That is because the political price of using them--particularly in Afghanistan where more innocent civilians have been killed or injured from landmines than perhaps anywhere else--would have been prohibitive.  It matters because, like any other issue, even when the United States is not part of the problem, we have to be part of the solution. We ought to set an example on this. We ought to be strong enough to do what 161 other countries have done and join the treaty.  I have spoken to President Obama about this. I know he shares my concern about the toll of innocent lives from landmines. As a Senator, he cosponsored my legislation. So did Secretary Hagel.  This is an unfinished job. It began with President Clinton. It is time to put the United States on a path to join the treaty. Only the Commander in Chief can do that. The world cries out to him to show that kind of moral leadership.                          ____________________
