 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session for the en bloc consideration of the following nominations received today: James N. Mattis to be Secretary of Defense; and John F. Kelly to be Secretary of Homeland Security. I ask consent that there be 20 minutes of debate on the nominations, equally divided in the usual form, and that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the nominations in the order listed with no intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table en bloc; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; that no further motions be in order; and that any statements relating to the nominations be printed in the Record.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
