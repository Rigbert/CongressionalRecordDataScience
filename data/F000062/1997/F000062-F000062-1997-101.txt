 President, I am proud to support the breast cancer research stamp bill, H.R. 1585, sponsored by Congresswoman Susan Molinari and approved in the House of Representatives yesterday on a vote of 422 to 3.  I, along with Senators D'Amato, Faircloth, and the original 51 cosponsors of my bill, the breast cancer research stamp Act (S. 726), have worked very hard to give life to this innovative breast cancer research stamp idea, which originated with a physician--Dr. Bodai from my State, and I am happy to see it become a reality today.  At a time when the National Cancer Institute can only fund 26 percent of applications, a drop from 60 percent in the 1970's, this legislation creates an innovative way for citizens to contribute to breast cancer research.  Under this bill:  Postal Service would establish a special rate of postage for first-class mail, not to exceed 25 percent of the first-class rate, as an alternative to the regular first-class postage. The additional sum would be contributed to breast cancer research.  The rate would be determined in part, by the Postal Service to cover administrative costs and the remainder by the Governors of the Postal Service.  Seventy percent of the funds raised would fund breast cancer research at NIH and 30 percent of the funds raised would go to breast cancer research at DOD.  The Postal Service would provide the stamp within a year from the date of enactment.  Within 3 months prior to the stamp's 2-year anniversary, the bill requires the Comptroller General to evaluate the effectiveness and the appropriateness of this method of fund raising and report its findings to Congress.                         The breast cancer Toll  There are 1.8 million women in America today with breast cancer. Another 1 million women do not know they have it; 180,200 new invasive cases will be diagnosed this year.  Breast cancer kills 46,000 women a year. It is the leading cause of death for women ages 35 to 52 and the second leading cause of cancer death in all women, claiming a woman's life every 12 minutes in this country.  For California, 20,230 women were diagnosed with breast cancer and 5,000 women will die from the disease. (Source: American Cancer Society--cancer facts and figures 1996.)  The San Francisco Bay area has one of the highest rates of breast cancer incidence and mortality in the world. According to the Northern California Cancer Center, bay area white women have the highest reported breast cancer rate in the world, 104 per 100,000 population. Bay area African-American women have the fourth highest reported rate in the world at 82 per 100,000.  In addition to the cost of women's lives, the annual cost of treatment of breast cancer in the United States is approximately $10 billion.  The incidence of breast cancer is increasing. In the 1950's, 1 in 20 women developed breast cancer. Today, it is one in eight and growing.  While we know there is a genetic link to some breast cancers, we do not understand the fundamental cause. In hearings I held as cochair of the Senate Cancer Coalition, we learned that environmental factors may lead to as much as 90 percent of breast cancer. We know that breast cancer rates vary between countries and when people migrate, they tend to acquire cancer rates closer to those of newly adopted countries within a generation.  Over the last 25 years, the National Institutes of Health has spent over $31.5 billion on cancer research--$2 billion of that on breast cancer. In the last 6 years alone, appropriations for breast cancer research have risen from $90 million in 1990 to $600 million today.  And the United States is privileged to have some of the most talented scientists and many of the leading cancer research centers in the world such as UCLA, UC San Francisco, Memorial Sloan-Kettering, the Dana Farber Institute, and M.D. Anderson. But researchers need funding. Science needs nourishment. Without it, promising avenues of scientific discovery go unexplored. Questions go unanswered. Cures go undiscovered.                         Citizen Contributions  The breast cancer research stamp bill allows anyone who chooses to, to conveniently contribute to Federal research and to finding a cure for the breast cancer epidemic. It is an innovative idea originating with an American citizen and I am very grateful for the support of the House yesterday.  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.
