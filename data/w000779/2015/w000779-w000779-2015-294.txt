President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senators Merkley, McConnell, and Paul in introducing the Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2015.  I introduced this bill during the 113th Congress with these same colleagues to amend a regulation that is holding America's economy back. I am committed to empowering American farmers and increasing domestic economic activity, and that is exactly what this bill will do.  The United States is the world's largest consumer of hemp products, yet it remains the only major industrialized country that bans hemp farming. As the United States imports millions of dollars of hemp products, such as textiles, foods, paper products and construction materials, American farmers who could grow hemp right here at home are unable to profit from this growing market. This is an outrageous restriction on free enterprise and does nothing but hurt economic growth and job creation.  The Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2015 would amend the definition of ``marihuana'' in the Controlled Substances Act to exclude industrial hemp, allowing American farmers to produce domestically the hemp we already use. Industrial hemp is a safe, profitable commodity in many other countries, and I've long said that if you can buy it at the local supermarket, American farmers should be able to grow it. This commonsense bill would end the burdensome restrictions on industrial hemp and is pro-environment, pro-business, and pro-farmer.  I encourage my colleagues to take the time to learn about the great potential for farming industrial hemp in the United States, and to understand the real differences between industrial hemp and marijuana. Under our bill, industrial hemp is defined as having extremely low THC levels: it has to be 0.3 percent or less. The lowest commercial grade marijuana typically has 5 percent THC content. The bottom line is that no one is going to get high on industrial hemp. And to guarantee that won't be the case, our legislation allows the U.S. Attorney General to take action if a state law allows commercial hemp to exceed the maximum 0.3 percent THC level.  I urge my colleagues to join Senators Merkley, McConnell, Paul, and me by cosponsoring and ultimately passing this important bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 134       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Industrial Hemp Farming Act      of 2015''.     SEC. 2. EXCLUSION OF INDUSTRIAL HEMP FROM DEFINITION OF                    MARIHUANA.       Section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C.      802) is amended--       (1) in paragraph (16)--       (A) by striking ``(16) The'' and inserting ``(16)(A) The'';      and       (B) by adding at the end the following:       ``(B) The term `marihuana' does not include industrial      hemp.''; and       (2) by adding at the end the following:       ``(57) The term `industrial hemp' means the plant Cannabis      sativa L. and any part of such plant, whether growing or not,      with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more      than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis.''.     SEC. 3. INDUSTRIAL HEMP DETERMINATION BY STATES.       Section 201 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C.      811) is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``(i) Industrial Hemp Determination.--If a person grows or      processes Cannabis sativa L. for purposes of making      industrial hemp in accordance with State law, the Cannabis      sativa L. shall be deemed to meet the concentration      limitation under section 102(57), unless the Attorney General      determines that the State law is not reasonably calculated to      comply with section 102(57).''.                                 ______                                       By
