Speaker, I rise today to praise and congratulate the North Point varsity basketball team on winning the Class 4A Maryland state finals. The narrow victory over Patterson High School on March 12th was not only a great achievement for the North Point Eagles but was the first time a Southern Maryland Athletic Conference team has taken the championship in 39 years.  This year's championship is the perfect ending to the perfect season. After months of training, practice, travel and games, the Eagles earned a number one seed and a home regional championship game against Glen Burnie. North Point put Glen Burnie to rest in one solid quarter, gaining a 29 to 6 lead from which Glen Burnie could not recover.  After 26 wins and no losses, North Point faced one last challenge--to beat Patterson High School in the state finals at the Comcast Center in College Park, Maryland. North Point took the lead early and then fell behind only to finish strong in dramatic fashion, triumphing by just 76 to 72 over their respectable opponents. The ``epic Blast at Comcast'' completed for a 27 and 0 record for these student-athletes, making them the only one in Maryland to have a perfect season.  Under the guidance of their coach, Jimmy Ball, this basketball team's strong defense made the difference. According to a recent news release, ``North Point led by as much as 16 points but found themselves trailing Patterson 66-65 with 3:20 remaining. Senior Gerel Simmons scored seven points in the final two and a half minutes to seal the title. Sophomores Naim Muhammad, who recorded a double-double (20 points, 11 rebounds), and Marquis Wright, who scored nine points and dished out 12 assists, paced the Eagles defensive effort against a Patterson team that averaged more than 80 points a contest this year. Senior captain Devonte Thomas scored 10 points and collected eight rebounds while Simmons finished with 19 points.''  Let me also honor the entire North Point High School community for they are an integral part of this team's victorious season. At every game the fans chant, in a unified voice, ``We are North Point.'' As Principal Kim Hill has said, the motto declares that ``We are many, but we are united as one.'' And as one team, one school, and one community they were able to accomplish victory. Congratulations to the North Point High School Eagles and the North Point Community.                          ____________________
