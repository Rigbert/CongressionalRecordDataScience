President, last year an amendment to the Fiscal Year 1996 Defense Authorization bill which I sponsored with 49 other senators, both Democrats and Republicans, to impose a 1-year moratorium on the use of anti-personnel landmines, except along international borders and in demilitarized zones, passed the Senate on August 4 of last year by a vote of 67 to 27. It was signed into law by President Clinton on February 12 of this year. Support for the moratorium has broadened in the Congress since then, due to the extraordinary media attention this issue has received and the experience of our troops in Bosnia.  Recently, it came to my attention that the House National Security Committee included a provision in its version of the fiscal year 1996 Defense authorization bill, which would effectively nullify my amendment. This provision is identical to a provision the House included last year, but which was deleted in the conference.  While I do not question the motives of the authors of that provision, I have communicated my concerns about it to Chairman Thurmond, as well as Senators Warner and Nunn. I have made clear that not only does this provision undermine the position of two-thirds of the Senate, it is totally unnecessary and premature since the moratorium would not take effect until February 1999. It also contradicts the Pentagon's considered judgment that it can manage with the Leahy moratorium, and ignores the administration's own position that it will not seek to modify or repeal the amendment.  Mr. President, on May 16, President Clinton announced the administration's long-awaited policy on landmines. While I was disappointed that the administration did not use this opportunity to renounce the use of an indiscriminate weapon that is responsible for horrendous suffering of civilians, the President did commit to vigorously negotiate an international agreement to ban antipersonnel mines. Over the next 2 years, we will have ample opportunity to judge the seriousness of the administration's efforts. With 41 nations already on record in support of an immediate, total ban, including many of our NATO allies, it is crucial that we preserve the Leahy amendment intact in order to reinforce our support for strong U.S. leadership in this global effort.  I am very pleased and appreciative that Chairman Thurmond has, like last year, answered my concerns by reaffirming his intention to defend the Senate position in conference. He was successful in doing so last year, and nothing has changed since then to weaken the Senate position. In fact, the official opinion of the Pentagon that it can live with the Leahy moratorium, the administration's policy to vigorously negotiate an international ban as soon as possible, and the growing number of countries that support a ban, should significantly strengthen it.  I hope the House will reconsider its position on this. There is no reason for an issue that has such broad public support, from veterans organizations to the Catholic Bishops to the American Red Cross, to become an issue of contention between us. If necessary, there is more than enough time to revisit this when the effective date of the moratorium approaches.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that excerpts from a May 16 Pentagon press briefing describing the Pentagon's opinion of my amendment, and my correspondence with Chairman Thurmond, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                             News Briefing      Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense--Public Affairs       Senior Defense Official #2: The President signed it into      law. I mean, we have not been happy with it with regard to      its provisions compared to this broader policy. The President      did accept it. And we believe we can live with it, but we      don't think it's an adequate--I didn't say we didn't support      it--I mean, we don't think it's an adequate answer to the      problem. And so, this policy is meant to answer the problem      in a broader way. If the moratorium stays in place, we can      live with that one year moratorium given the exceptions that      are written into it.       Q: All anti-personnel mines?       Senior Defense Official #2: Anti-personnel landmines.                                                                    ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                                     Washington, DC, May 12, 1996.     Hon. Strom Thurmond,     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, Washington, DC.       Dear Strom: It has come to my attention that the House      National Security Committee has included in its FY 1997      Defense Authorization bill the same certification provision      concerning my anti-personnel landmine moratorium amendment      that was deleted last year.       Not only is this provision unnecessary since the moratorium      does not take effect until February 1999, it also would      nullify the effect of the amendment which was supported by      over two-thirds of the Senate in a bipartisan vote.       If necessary, I will take whatever measures are necessary      to prevent this attempt by the House to undermine the      Senate's position on my amendment. However, your help was      instrumental in getting this same provision deleted from the      bill last year. Before I make any decision on this, I would      appreciate knowing whether I can count on you to prevent this      provision from being included in the final version of the FY      1997 Defense Authorization bill.       I look forward to hearing from you soon.           With best regards.                                                    Patrick Leahy,                                                     U.S. Senator.                                                      U.S. Senate,                                  Committee on Armed Services,                                Washington, DC, December 18, 1995.     Sen. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: Pursuant to our discussion on the floor      this morning concerning consideration of the National Defense      Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, I would like to recap      our agreement.       We have agreed that: You will control 20 minutes of debate      on the landmine provision and I will control the same amount      of time; you will not filibuster the defense authorization      conference report and will not object to a unanimous consent      for a time certain to vote on the defense authorization      conference report; and if the current version of the FY 96      Defense Authorization bill does not become law, I will do      everything in my power to ensure that section 1402(b)      (concerning a certification in relation to the moratorium on      landmine use) is deleted from any subsequent version of the      bill. If the current version of the FY 96 Defense      Authorization bill is signed into law, I will do everything      in my power to ensure that section 1402(b) is reversed in the      next Defense Authorization bill.           Sincerely,                                                   Strom Thurmond,     Chairman.                                                                    ____                                                      U.S. Senate,                                  Committee on Armed Services,                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 1996.     Sen. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Pat: Thank you for your recent correspondence      regarding the anti-personnel landmine moratorium. I      appreciate your bringing to my attention the provision in the      House defense bill regarding a requirement for a      certification prior to the imposition of a moratorium.       As the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I      will support the Senate position on any issue that comes      before the conference on the defense authorization bill.      However, as you know, it is impossible for me, or any other      member of the Senate, to predict or guarantee the outcome of      any particular provision during the conference of a bill. As      always, I would support the Senate position with the House in      the conference on the defense authorization bill.       As I recall our agreement last year it was that I would not      offer any language to the fiscal year 1997 defense bill that      would undermine your provision, and you would not offer      language regarding the anti-personnel landmine moratorium to      the fiscal year 1997 defense authorization bill. I have kept      that agreement--there is no language in the fiscal year 1997      Senate defense authorization bill regarding the anti-     personnel landmine moratorium.       With kindest regards and best wishes,           Sincerely,                                                   Strom Thurmond,                                                         Chairman.
