 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, the House will convene on Tuesday at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several measures under suspension of the rules. A final list of those bills will be sent to Members' offices by the end of this week. Any votes called on these measures will be rolled until 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday.  On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will convene at 10 a.m. We plan to consider the budget resolution for fiscal year 2005. We would hope to complete several hours of general debate on Wednesday before moving into the amendment process on Thursday.  And, finally, I would like to note for all the Members, and they should take note, that we are making a change to the schedule that was sent to offices at the beginning of the year. We do not plan to have votes next Friday, March 26.  I thank the gentleman for yielding and would be happy to answer any questions.
