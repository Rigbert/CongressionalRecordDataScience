President, the reason these names are being read is to share with my colleagues in the Senate the fact that this is not just another issue. The issue of gun safety and gun violence in America is an ongoing tragedy, a tragedy which we will read about in tomorrow morning's paper and the next morning's paper and every day thereafter until we in this country come forward with a sensible gun safety policy to keep guns out of the hands of those who misuse them.  I have seen the National Rifle Association, Mr. Heston, and all of his claims about second amendment rights to the ownership of guns. I believe people have a right to own guns, so long as they do so safely and legally, but I do not believe there is a single right under our Constitution--not one--that does not carry with it a responsibility.  There is a responsibility on the part of gun owners across America to buy their guns in a way that will keep guns out of the hands of those who would misuse them and to store their guns in a way so they are safely away from children who would use guns and hurt themselves and others, and not to demand guns in America that have no legitimate sport, hunting, or self-defense purpose.  Most Americans agree with what I have just said. I think it is a majority opinion in this country. It is clearly not the feeling of the Republican leadership in the Senate and the House of Representatives. They have continued to bottle up this legislation which would move us closer to the day when we have a safer society and when families and communities across America can breathe a sigh of relief that the crime statistics and gun statistics about which we read are continuing to go down and not up.                          ____________________
