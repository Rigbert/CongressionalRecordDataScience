 Madam Speaker, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Archer) stated correctly that there is a significant problem with a surge in steel imports into the United States of America. In the first 6 months of this year compared to the first 6 months of last year, imports have surged from South Korea by 89 percent.                              {time}  1800  Imports from Japan have surged 113 percent. Imports from Indonesia have surged over 300 percent. People have lost their jobs. They are not going to get laid off, they are not going to lose their jobs, they have lost their jobs.  The gentleman from Texas was also correct, that in a bipartisan fashion a period of time ago, a significant number of Members in the House of Representatives introduced a resolution to call upon the administration, that has not acted on this matter, to take action. The administration has not acted, and people have lost their jobs because of that. That is why we are here tonight, because if the President of the United States is not going to enforce the trade statutes of the United States of America, we have a constitutional responsibility to do it in this House.  I have the utmost respect for the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Regula), the chairman of the Congressional Steel Caucus, as well as the Vice-Chair, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murtha), and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Quinn), who chairs the executive committee.  We were all on that original resolution, and we called for the enhanced enforcement of the United States trade laws with respect to the surge in steel imports. We asked that the United States government use all remedies available under those laws, including offsetting duties, I stand to be corrected if that is not the law of the land today, and the instrument of the law under the Constitution that the President can use today.  We said in that resolution, that bipartisan resolution, calling upon our president, who has not acted, that he should use quantitative restraints if necessary. That is exactly what the European community has done. They have put up a wall. People are so cavalier when they come in. They say yes, the Europeans did it, but we are going to cause a crisis internationally if we simply protect ourselves from an illegal international action.  If I am wrong that quantitative restraints are not allowable under the law of the land today, I stand to be corrected right now, and other authorized remedial measures as appropriate that are available to the President of the United States.  The second paragraph of that resolution that was introduced in a bipartisan fashion to call upon the President, who has not acted, said that the President should pursue with all tools at his disposal a more equitable sharing of the burden of accepting imports of finished steel products from Asia and the countries within the Commonwealth.  The language we have before us today says that we should consult with the officials of Japan, we should consult with the officials of Korea, we should consult with the European Union. I bet Mr. Kim at Pohang Steel is going to lay awake tonight worrying about our consultation. We are going to consult him to death between now and January 3. Mr. Yakamura of Nippon Steel in Japan, the guy is probably going to have a heart attack because we are going to consult with the Japanese. We have been consulting for 6 months, and nobody has taken any action.  I bet the foreign ministers of Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, I bet they are going to be apoplectic because we are going to consult with them.  Do Members know what, they have a job. They have a job. But 450 white-collar workers at Inland Steel in Chicago, Indiana, they do not have a job today. They do not have a job today. On October 7, 2 days ago, or 5 days ago, I stand corrected, Timken Steel in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, laid off 160 workers. They do not have a job today. That foreign minister in France got his job.  Forty-seven steelworkers who were laid off at three Ohio steel-producing facilities last month, those 47 workers, I will bet most of them are married, I will bet most have kids, most have a mortgage, and they cannot wait until January 5, with Christmas and Thanksgiving, and three months of feeding their kids and sending them to school.  We have 40 union workers laid off at Timken Steel in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. We had, on September 2nd, 400 people laid off at Inland Steel, in addition to the 450. Geneva Steel in Utah, an 18 percent cutback, 355 people as of September 29. As of 1\1/2\ weeks ago, those 350, they are not working, but the guy in Luxembourg, the guy in Japan, the guy in Korea, he is working. He is working.  The President has done nothing. We have an obligation to do something. The third portion of our resolution, bipartisanly introduced, said that the administration ought to establish a task force within the branch with the responsibility for closely monitoring imports. No great quibble here.  The resolution before us today says we will continue to closely monitor. A lot of good that has done for all of these other people that have continued to lose their jobs, the 200 people in Fairfield, Alabama, who on September 1 were laid off by U.S. Steel, the 100 people in Mon Valley, Pittsburgh, who were laid off on September 1.  That monitoring so far to date, the last 6 months, has not helped the people at Slater Steel, where 51 positions were eliminated last week. Last Thursday, 51 people lost their jobs. It did not help them that we have been monitoring since last summer.  The last part of our resolution said that there should be a report to us, to the Republicans, to the Democrats, a report to us by the President, who has not acted, on the comprehensive plan we want him to develop to deal with this surge. We want a plan in place. We want action taken no later than that. The resolution before us today said that the President ought to report back and say he should tell us what the impact is by January 5.  I have a couple more. Acme Steel in Riverdale, Illinois. They just filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. A good thing we had a bankruptcy bill on the House floor last week. We anticipated that event.  We have lost jobs. We are losing jobs as the weeks go by. We are asking for the President to come back in 3 months with this resolution and say, tell us what the impact is, Mr. President. We would really like to know.  Everybody in this Chamber is smart enough to know what the problem is. I respect all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, because we all want the same thing to happen. We want the President of the United States to act. We want this institution to act.  But in the last day or two of this Congress, to stand before the American people with a resolution that says, report back to us on the impact, let us monitor this, let us consult people to death, is a sham, and I am not going to lie to the workers who are losing their jobs every day.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
