Chair, as the author of the 2004's Water Supply, Reliability and Environmental Improvement Act, also known as CALFED, I strongly supported H.R. 1837, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Water Reliability Act. This bill is an important step in preventing onerous regulations from creating another manmade drought like the one that devastated farms and families in California's San Joaquin Valley in 2009 and 2010. As a result of this man-made drought, many farmers lost their livelihoods and many communities saw unemployment rates top 50 percent as jobs dried up with their water.  With California once again faced with record low precipitation this year, we cannot wait to act. Among other things, H.R. 1837 would restore water deliveries to communities by codifying the Bay-Delta Accord and protects and secures private property and senior water rights. This bill will ensure communities will no longer have their water cut off and diverted due to heavy-handed environmental regulation and litigation that attempts to place fish before farmers and families.  This bill protects over 30,000 jobs and strikes a common sense balance between environmental regulations and environmental realities to ensure that California's Central Valley will never again be plunged into man-made drought. I commend my colleague Representative Devin Nunes of California for his leadership in crafting this important piece of legislation.                          ____________________
