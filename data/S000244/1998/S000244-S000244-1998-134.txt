Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution of inquiry.  At Monday's meeting of the Committee on the Judiciary, Investigative Counsel David Shippers informed the committee that the material received to date shows that the President may have committed 15 felonies. These alleged felonies were in the course of the President's successfully defeating Paula Jones' civil rights lawsuit, claims the Supreme Court in a 9-0 decision said that she had the right to pursue. The President denies all these allegations. Obviously someone is telling the truth and someone is lying.  The Committee on the Judiciary must be given the power to decide this issue. What is at stake here is the rule of law. Even the President of the United States has no right to break the law. If the House votes down this inquiry, in effect, it will say that even if President Clinton committed as many as 15 felonies, nothing will happen. The result will be a return to the imperial presidency of the Nixon era where the White House felt that the laws did not apply to them, since they never would be punished. That would be a national tragedy of immense consequences.  Vote for the resolution. Let the Committee on the Judiciary try to find the truth.
