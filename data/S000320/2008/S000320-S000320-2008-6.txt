 President, I rise to speak in support of the final passage of H.R. 3221, the legislation before us Senator Dodd and others have been talking about. This legislation contains numerous provisions that address a wide variety of issues associated with the housing crisis. Many of them, in fact, were previously considered and passed by the Senate in earlier versions of this bill right here on the floor. I wish to highlight a few of these important provisions now.  As the Presiding Officer well knows, because he is an important player in this and a very important member of the Banking Committee, this final package contains the same mortgage refinance program included in the earlier bills. This is a temporary, voluntary program within the Federal Housing Administration to back FHA-insured mortgages to distressed borrowers. It requires both mortgage lenders and borrowers to give up some of their financial interest in order to participate.
