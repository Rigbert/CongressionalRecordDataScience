 President, I would like to speak 6 or 7 minutes as in morning business, but I also would like to ask--if there is nobody on the other side of the aisle who would intervene--if I could have another 15 minutes after this time. I do not wish to take advantage of anything, but if they do not know of any other people from the Democratic Party who wish to speak, I would like to speak longer. But right now I ask unanimous consent for 6 or 7 minutes.
