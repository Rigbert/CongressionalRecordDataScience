  As I listened carefully to my friend from Maryland, he is straining to think of a good argument against this worthwhile amendment. It has been my experience over the years in the Senate that when we start saying there has been no committee action, there have been no hearings, we are having a hard time thinking of a good argument against the proposal on the merits.  So let me repeat again what the merits are. It seems to me we do not need committee hearings or committee action to convince us that a 45-day bereavement rule for victims and their families, which we have already adopted in Federal law for victims and families of plane crashes--we do not need committee action to tell us this is a fundamentally appropriate thing to do.  Do we need hearings and committee action to tell us that in Federal claims and in Federal cases it is appropriate and only right that lawyers provide information to their clients at the beginning, during, and at the end of their handling of the case as to the possible costs involved? That is what is before us, not the issue of whether or not we should have hearings on this or whether or not the committee should act. My goodness, we spent 6 weeks on an energy bill that the committee did not pass out of the Energy Committee. We do that frequently. The Senate is not known to be constrained by tight rules of germaneness, nor by official committee action.  So I urge my colleagues to look at the amendment itself, not these rather extraneous arguments seeking to divert our attention away from what the amendment itself provides, which is protections for consumers of legal services.  I reserve the remainder of my time.
