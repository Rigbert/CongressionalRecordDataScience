First of all, I appreciate all the Senator from Colorado has done in this field.  I say to the Senator, in your statement, when you talked about that some of our allies, some of our friends, such as the Japanese, might be more susceptible because of their proximity to North Korea, I remind my colleagues what happened 6 years ago this coming August when the North Koreans did in fact fire a multistage rocket that had the capability of reaching the United States of America. So that threat is still there for us.  I was going to ask my colleague a couple questions about his amendment. But if somebody else desires the floor, that is perfectly all right.
