 I heard so many people say, you don't have to worry about a black market, it is not going to happen. There is a black market today in California based on the present $2-per-pack price. The trick really is how the bill phases in per-pack pricing increases plus FDA's regulation of content and nicotine to see that it is done in a way that does not create an increased black market or increased smuggling. We provide in our bill an additional $9.4 billion over 25 years for enforcement of antismuggling provisions.  So, if the ultimate goal of tobacco legislation is to reduce teen smoking and smoking overall, we believe this bill will pass scrutiny by our colleagues. We offer to work with anyone who cares to work with us.  I would like very much to thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I very much enjoyed working with him on this bill.  I now yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished Senator from Louisiana.
