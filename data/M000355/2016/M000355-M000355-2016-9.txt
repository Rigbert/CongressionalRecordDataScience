 President, let me explain before my colleague, the Democratic leader, addresses the matter. What this does is set up votes in connection with the CR at 10 p.m., but then I want everybody to understand that if we can't get an agreement to move the WRDA votes up to that series of votes, they will occur 3 hours later, at 1 a.m. Failure to consent to including WRDA will only delay the Senate until 1 a.m. in the morning.  Let me go over that again. At the moment, I understand there is an objection to adding the WRDA votes to the stack that we just agreed to. So without consent, we will be here another 3 hours or so, voting at 1 a.m. Everybody should understand we are going to finish all of these votes tonight, and that is the schedule for the rest of the evening.
