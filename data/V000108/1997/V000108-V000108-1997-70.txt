Speaker, it is my privilege to congratulate St. John the Baptist Catholic Church in Hammond, IN, on the joyous occasion of its centennial celebration this Sunday, June 22, 1997. The day's festivities will begin with a Mass of Thanksgiving at 3:00 p.m., officiated by the Most Reverend Dale J. Melczek. Following the mass, a gala reception will begin at 4:30 p.m. in the parish's Panel Room Banquet Hall. The reception will include dinner, several guest speakers, and live performances by the Lubo Pala Slovak Folk Band, the Vychodna Slovak Folk Dance Ensemble, soprano, Dorothy Hoover, the St. John adult choir, and the Stanley Paul Orchestra.  The founding of St. John the Baptist Church is one of struggle and triumph. In the spring of 1897, after successfully petitioning Bishop Joseph Radermacher for a Czechoslovakian priest to serve those in the community of Slovak heritage, a welcoming committee met Father Benedict Rajcany in Hammond on April 17, Holy Saturday. His first mass was offered on Easter Sunday 1897 at Sacred Heart Church in Whiting, IN, since no Slovak church existed at the time. Soon after, the Slovak Catholic Union Branch 130 transformed its meeting hall into a church, which was dedicated on July 4, 1897. The church was dedicated to St. John the Baptist because the new pastor stated he felt like ``one crying in the wilderness'' in his new assignment in the United States.  By the time World War I began in 1914, the church had been enlarged to accommodate 650 parishioners. By 1921, the first regular assistant, Father Michael Kosko, was appointed to the church. During his ministry, Father Rajcany continued to place emphasis on the English language and on the Americanization of his parishioners. Some objected, but their reluctance was soon overcome. At approximately the same time, priests from St. Joseph College in Rensselaer, IN, journeyed to assist the parish on weekends.  By 1925, it became apparent that a new and larger church would be needed. That same year, the future pastor of St. John, Reverend John Kostik, C.P.P.S., arrived as a permanent assistant. Later, at the suggestion of Father Rajcany, Father Kostik was appointed pastor of St. John by Bishop John F. Noll. Also during that year, the parish was placed under the supervision of the Society of the Precious Blood, and it continues to be served by priests of the society to this day.  Groundwork for the new church, the work of Chicago architect Herman Gaul, began in May, 1930. Knowing the economic seriousness of the times and the dangers of bankruptcy, Father Kostik placed the success of the $300,000 venture in the hands of St. Therese, the Little Flower of Jesus. Amazingly, during this period of financial disaster, the parish lost only $340, and the entire debt was retired by 1942. The new Romanesque style church, with its 190-foot steeple, stands as a tribute to God from those founders of Slovak heritage.  In the late 1940's, much-needed additions to the parish were begun. Plans conceived by then-pastor Father John F. Lafko, C.P.P.S., were carried out by his successor, Father Gabriel Brenkus, C.P.P.S. In 1948, construction on the first phase of the new school, consisting of classrooms, a convent, and the Panel Room Banquet Hall, began. After its completion in 1951, the second phase of construction, consisting of an auditorium, gymnasium, and additional classrooms, began in 1955. The final addition to the St. John the Baptist complex was a new rectory, which was completed in 1967.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating the parish family of St. John the Baptist, under the guidance of Father John Kalicky, C.P.P.S., and former pastor-in-residence Father Edward Homco, C.P.P.S., as they prepare to celebrate their centennial in 1997. Their slogan, ``We Remember, We Celebrate, We Believe,'' reverberates throughout the community in a celebration of faith--faith in God, faith in country, and faith in people. In this spirit, St. John has enhanced the quality of life within the Hammond community through its religious, educational, and cultural contributions for the past 100 years.                          ____________________
