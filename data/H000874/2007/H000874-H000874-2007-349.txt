Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  (1) That during all proceedings today on H.R. 2642, the Military Construction bill, the Chair be authorized to reduce to 2 minutes the minimum time for electronic voting on any question that otherwise could be subjected to 5-minute voting under clause 8 or 9 of rule XX or under clause 6 of rule XVIII; and  (2) That during proceedings in the House today on both H.R. 2638 and H.R. 2642, the Chair be authorized to reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for electronic voting on even the first vote in a series.  Mr. Speaker, by this order I am proposing that the first vote in any series in the Committee of the Whole will be, as usual, a 15-minute vote; that the first vote in a series back in the House after concluding business in the Committee of the Whole may be, and we expect will be, a 5-minute vote; and that subsequent votes in any series and in either setting may be 2-minute votes.
