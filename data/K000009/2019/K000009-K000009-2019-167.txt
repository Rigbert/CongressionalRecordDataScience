Next week members will come together to celebrate this significant milestone, both reminiscing and looking toward the future.  The International Hod Carriers' and Building Laborers' Union (which would become today's Laborers' International Union of North America, or LIUNA) Local No. 500 was chartered on October 20, 1919 to represent laborers who were in demand to build roads, bridges and other infrastructure in Toledo and Northwest Ohio. The union has since provided skills training to thousands of laborers and secured living wages, health insurance and retirement pension benefits for thousands of its members who live and work in Northwest Ohio, allowing them to live decent, productive lives; provide for their families; and retire with dignity and security. Local 500 has produced many community leaders and has been a beacon in our community.  Local 500 helped protect its hundreds of members during the Great Depression of the 1930s while working to build landmark Toledo structures under the federal New Deal program, including University Stadium at the University of Toledo and the Toledo Main Public Library. Members also contributed mightily on the home front during World War II, helping to build many of the Northwest Ohio factories that supplied and eventually helped win the war effort.  Over the years, Local 500 members have helped build many of the vital highways, roads, bridges and infrastructure of Northwest Ohio, including the Toledo Municipal Airport, the Ohio Turnpike, the Davis Besse Nuclear Power Station, Veterans' Glass City Skyway, Interstate 280 and Interstate 475. Members have helped build and rebuild downtown Toledo, including the Fiberglas Tower, Promenade Park, One Seagate Tower, Owens Corning World Headquarters and the Fifth Third Field baseball stadium.  At the same time as the members of Local 500 helped to build and shape our region, they have remained eager and important contributors to our community. The union participates in charitable initiatives such as repairing the City of Toledo's Wilson and Farr pools and sponsoring the Kings Kids Academy and Family House Homeless Shelter.  Today, as Local 500 turns 100 years old, it continues to serve and protect its membership and its six-county jurisdiction of Lucas, Wood, Fulton, Henry, Defiance, and Williams counties while providing the region with a skilled workforce involved in the placement and removal of concrete, demolition, asbestos removal, grade checking, flagging, carpenters tenders, brick mason tenders, hazardous waste removal, tunneling and more.  President Barack Obama noted, ``Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.'' As the membership of LIUNA Local 500 looks back on a century of progress and changing both lives and community for the better, we pause to remember those on whose shoulders we stand. We look forward to the next century with promise. Onward.                          ____________________
