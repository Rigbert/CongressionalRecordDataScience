Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  My purpose was not to be partisan in presentation, as is alleged by the chairman, my good friend, the chairman of the committee. My purpose was to say that there is a very simple way to get out of this perceived problem, and that is to say, yes, we have differences, they are substantive differences, and we are debating them, and we will go on debating them for probably weeks to come because there is substantial disagreement within your party and between the President and the Congress. The simple way to do it is to say we do not intend to shut down the parks or other aspects of Government. The fact of the matter is, we are going to operate Government while we debate these issues.  I would say to the gentleman that that was my point. I think it is a valid point on this bill and others like it that seek to accept certain portions as opposed to making sure that the Government continues to operate.
