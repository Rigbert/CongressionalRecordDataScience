Speaker, this Medicare conference report is, sadly, a missed opportunity. I was here in 1983. Ronald Reagan, Tip O'Neill, and Bob Michael joined together to save Social Security. They came together, President Reagan, Speaker O'Neill, and Minority Leader Michael and said, we need to have a bill that has bipartisan support and will get the job done.                              {time}  0030  It did.  The Republicans rejected that model. Most Members of this body on both sides of the aisle recognize that it is long past time that we provide for our seniors and give them a prescription drug program; but it is not this bill that they expected, a feeble benefit that forces them to pay 80 percent of their costs.  I will tell the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ginny Brown-Waite) her dad was right. He was a Democrat because this party has historically and now believes that we should have done better by our seniors. Even the conservative Heritage Foundation, which is against this bill because they want to see Medicare done away with, says this, ``The politically engineered premiums and deductibles, coupled with the odd combination of `donut holes' or gaps in drug coverage, are likely to be unpopular with seniors.''  The Heritage Foundation said that. Not Steny Hoyer, not Democrats. Even Dick Armey, the immediate past leader of our party wrote in the Wall Street Journal on Friday that this conference report is ``bad news for seniors.''  Your majority leader just past said that. Now, he wants to do away with Medicare. He does not believe we ought to have Medicare. He nevertheless says this is bad news for seniors. Because it is bad news for seniors, we ought to vote against this bad bill.
