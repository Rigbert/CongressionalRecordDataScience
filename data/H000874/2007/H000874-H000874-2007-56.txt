And the reason I say it's possible is because a lot of Members, obviously, would like to get out. It's Thanksgiving week. We're leaving. And I'm not sure whether it's a majority of your side or the majority, but I think there's probably unanimity that if we could see our way clear to finishing the business that we have by Thursday, they would prefer to work Tuesday night than they would prefer to work on Friday day. So I want to say to my friend it's possible, to facilitate the work. We're going to be talking about that later on today, and maybe even over the weekend, where we are. So I want to say to the gentleman, it's possible.
