 Chairman, I think the gentleman from Oregon just made a very important point, and maybe somebody can correct me if I am wrong here. My understanding is that this particular program is up for reauthorization next year. If that is so, and I cannot swear to it, but that is my understanding, then that is the time to discuss this issue.  Now, the truth of the matter is what we are doing here, and maybe the chairman wants to deny it, is we are legislating in an appropriations bill. I guess there is a rule that allows the chairman to do it, but that is what he is doing. We are making a profound change in a bill that should be dealt with in an authorizing committee, that should have serious debate, that should involve the States.  The gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) raised some very important issues. Some of the States have balanced budgets precisely because they have cut back on programs like that, and we are now going to go to the States and expect that they are going to add more money to programs that they have already cut? I doubt it.  What is the impact? Have we really studied the impact of what it would mean for a number of States, maybe some of the poorest States in this country, not to have this program? How many people might die?  I would refer my colleagues to The Washington Post of last Friday. ``Officials said that those who died in the heat wave may have not had air conditioners on because they worried about payment of the electricity bills or kept their windows closed.'' Those are exactly the people that we are trying to help out in this very successful, cost-effective program.  So I would hope that if the chairman believes in this idea, he will bring it back next year when this bill is reauthorized and we can have a serious debate on it, but I would ask for support for the Sanders amendment, which has widespread support.
