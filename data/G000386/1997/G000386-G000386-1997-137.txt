 President, look at how wrong the argument of the Senator from Arizona is, that when a consumer doesn't pay a gasoline tax, it turns out to be a subsidy to an industry. How wrong that argument can be. This is not a subsidy to any industry. If this amendment passes, after the year 2000 the consumers of America are going to pay more gas tax on that portion of their gasoline that is ethanol. This is good for the environment and good for agriculture. It is good for jobs in the cities--195,000 jobs. It is good for energy independence and everything. It is good, good, good.
