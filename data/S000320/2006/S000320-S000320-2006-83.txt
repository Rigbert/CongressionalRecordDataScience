 President, Jessie Tehranchi was a passionate advocate for improved public transportation and universal health care from my State of Alabama. Jessie dedicated her time to helping others as she worked to advocate on behalf of the issues that shaped her life.  Jessie's passion was personal; diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1987, she spent much of her adult life confined to a wheelchair. Faced with seemingly insurmountable odds, Jessie used her experience to better the lives of many others with similar handicaps. A fixture in transportation activist groups, she spoke across the country on behalf of her causes.  Jessie testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs in 2002 at a Housing and Transportation Subcommittee meeting. Jessie emphasized the need for effective public transportation and cited her own experiences as a person unable to drive. Her testimony was powerful and useful as the Senate worked on the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century.  Jessie was optimistic, energetic, and passionate. I am proud of her efforts, and I am grateful for her dedication to this important cause. I know that she will be missed not only by her husband, Jim Tehranchi, and two sons, David and Michael, and her many friends, but by the many people whose lives she touched through her devotion to public transportation.                          ____________________[Page S443]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                      TRIBUTE TO JESSIE TEHRANCHI
