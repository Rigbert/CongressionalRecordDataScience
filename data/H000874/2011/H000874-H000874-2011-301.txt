I know that he has indicated that we are going to be considering what I believe to be a $52 million cut--that's important money--to reach your $100 billion. However, if you do it at that level per week, of course, you will take approximately 50 years to get to $100 billion if we consider one every week that we are in session.  My presumption is that you will be informing us of those opportunities to cut as well, giving us opportunities on our side. There may well be Members on our side who want to join in making sure that we spend our money as effectively and efficiently as possible. But we also know and the commissions that have reported know that while these types of expenditures are important to review, I don't know that there have been any hearings on this YouCut. I know that this has been in response to the Web page question that you have propounded to people--I don't know how many responses you have received to that. But are you intending to have hearings in relevant committees on future propositions to cut?
