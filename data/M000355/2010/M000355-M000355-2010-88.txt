  Americans are speaking out, but Democrats in Congress still aren't listening. At a time when Americans are clamoring for Democrats in Congress to do something about jobs and the economy, Democrats are not only turning a deaf ear, they are spending 2 full days here working to silence the voices of even more people with a bill that picks and chooses who has a right to political speech. This is precisely why Americans are speaking out loudly--loudly--about the excesses of this administration and this Congress. This is why Senate Republicans strongly support the efforts Republicans in theHouse will unveil later this morning in Virginia.
