Speaker, if the Speaker and the House would give me leave, let me say how proud I am to see Mr. Langevin presiding over the House of Representatives; how proud I am that we have made a reasonable accommodation, so somebody like Jim Langevin from Rhode Island, whose character and intellect has commended him to the electorate of Rhode Island to send him to the House of Representatives; how proud I am that we made a reasonable accommodation in the House of Representatives so that Mr. Langevin, as he properly should have the ability to do, preside over the House of Representatives.  Congratulations, Mr. Langevin, for your courage and your leadership and your extraordinary example.                          ____________________
