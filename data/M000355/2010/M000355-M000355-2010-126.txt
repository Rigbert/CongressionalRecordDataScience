 I appreciate the majority leader taking out basically the appropriations measures. One was in the underlying bill and the others were going to be offered as amendments.  I had not originally intended to offer a counter UC, but in order to reassure everyone--I know there is support on our side of the aisle if we can get it right--I offer a counter UC which I suppose will be objected to, as I will object to the majority leader's, for the afternoon.  But I want to underscore what he said, which is I do think we are getting closer to getting back to the original bill which started off on a pretty strong bipartisan basis and then seemed to deteriorate over the course of the last month. In fact, we turned to the bill on June 24 and left it six times between then and now.  Having said all that, I think we are heading back in the right direction.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture motions with respect to the small business substitute and the bill be vitiated. I further ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be the only amendments in order to the Reid substitute, and there are four: Johanns amendment No. 1099, repeal; Hatch, R&D Grassley, biodiesel; Sessions, spending caps. I further ask unanimous consent that it be in order for the majority to offer relevant side-by-sides limited to the subject matter of the above-listed amendments. And, as I said last night, we are prepared to enter into reasonable time agreements on each of these amendments.
