Speaker, our World War II veterans remind us of a time when our country stood united in the pursuit of independence and liberty, whether it be for others on foreign soil, or here at home. Twelve years ago, Roger Durbin, my constituent and a World War II combat veteran, asked me why there was no national monument to honor those who served in this war. Legislation I sponsored and Congress passed will rectify that grievous oversight. However, until the memorial is completed, a new postage stamp will serve to recognize those contributing to the war effort. I am inserting in today's Record the following speech by Roger Durbin, documenting the bravery of those who served and celebrating the release of the new stamp in their honor. An Address by Roger Durbin Celebrating the Stamp Unveiling, November                                 19, 1998       Mr. Vice-President, Mr. Postmaster General, General      Woerner, thank you for allowing me to share this honor with      you today.       It's a double honor for me to participate in a ceremony to      unveil a stamp commemorating World War II. In 1979, I retired      from the U.S. Postal Service after spending 32 years as a      rural carrier in Berkey, Ohio, near Toledo. I've been told      that I am that last surviving member of branch 4408 of the      National Association of Letter Carriers.       I am proud of my career as a letter carrier. But today, on      the eve of Veteran's Day my thoughts are focused on a      different uniform-one I wore in Europe in the 1940s. I was a      member of the Tenth Armored Division and participated in the      Battle of the Bulge, one of the costliest battles ever fought      by Americans. I have memories of those cold bitter days that      will be with me until I die.       One memory I wish to share with you is about the Battle for      Metz. It was the first time Metz had been captured in 1,500      years. Three bridges had to be built to cross the Mozells      River at Thionville, France, while the 4th and 90th Infantry      established a bridgehead. They met a terrible resistance.      During the night, civilians pointed out to the Germans where      the Americans were sleeping. By morning, only one man was      still alive from the German counter-attack. Later history      called this attack the ``Killing Fields of Kerling.''       When daylight came, it was a terrible sight-a sight that      cannot be forgotten by those who saw it. The American dead      were neatly stacked in the ditches like cords of wood. The      German dead were in their foxholes, eyes wide open still      keeping their vigil of surveillance. The retreating Germans      had body-trapped their dead. They had to be removed by our      engineers. Right then I decided that those Germans were      really trying to kill me.       ``Saving Private Ryan'' has brought attention to the horror      of war to those born since World War II ended. The D-Day      depicted was but one battle. Six hundred thousand American      soldiers fought in the Battle of the Bulge. There were 91,000      casualties in just 30 days. The bitterness of that 1944      December cold cannot be forgotten. A wounded, bleeding      soldier could be dead and frozen solid in just three hours.      It was so cold that on Christmas night I had lain on top of      the half-track transmission in an effort to get warm.       We moved back east of Metz after the battle had ended to      draw new equipment and to get replacements. The replacements      were eighteen and nineteen year old boys that had been home      with families for Christmas dinner in 1944.       Those of us in the Tenth Armored Division who survived the      Battle of the Bulge had the honor of being the first American      soldiers from Patton's Third Army to cross the German border.      The Tenth seized 450 towns and cities and earned more than      3,000 medals. But it was achieved at a terrible cost. When      finished, the Tenth Armored had 8,381 killed, wounded, and      missing casualties. There was a 78.5 percent turnover of      personnel.       As a nation we must never forget that cost.       The stamp we are unveiling today commemorates World War II      as one of the most significant events of the Twentieth      Century. It is a fitting tribute for all who were involved in      this struggle for a way of life, a world. This was the war      that had the involvement of almost the entire population.       Three years ago I had the honor of joining President      Clinton in dedicating a World War II Memorial site on the      Mall between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln      Memorial. We sprinkled sacred soil from sixteen overseas      American cemeteries in which are buried thousands of      Americans who were not as fortunate as I am. They never made      it home.       Ground is to be broken in 2000 and the memorial dedicated      in 2002. When Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur started the memorial      legislation eleven years ago there were 13.5 million living      World War II veterans. An average of 30,000 World War II      veterans now die each month. Only 7 million remain of those      alive twelve years ago. For most of those now remaining, this      stamp will be the nation's tribute to their service.                               ____________________
