Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4019, a bill to amend title 4 of the United States Code to clarify the treatment of self-employment for the purposes of the limitation on State taxation of retirement income.  This bill makes technical and clarifying amendments to the legislation enacted in 1996 to restrict the ability of States to tax certain pension income received by their former residents and nonresidents who earned income in that State.  Virtually every State correctly interpreted the law to encompass all retired individuals as Congress intended, and adjusted their tax systems accordingly. However, after 10 years, at least one State has sought to promote an interpretation of the law at odds with congressional intent by taxing the retirement income of partners who no longer live in the State or who may never even have ever lived there.  H.R. 4019 clarifies and reiterates the policy Congress wrote into Public Law 104-95, that States are prohibited from taxing the retirement income of all nonresident retirees, whether the individual is a retired employee, partner or principal.  Mr. Speaker, this bill, which enjoys bipartisan support, merely restores fairness and the original intent of Congress by reaffirming that States should treat all retirees equally.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
