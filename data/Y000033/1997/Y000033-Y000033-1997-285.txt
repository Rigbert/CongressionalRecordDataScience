Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce this legislation to reauthorize and improve the effectiveness of the act of September 15, 1960, commonly referred to as the Sikes Act.  Since coming to Congress in 1973, I have led the fight to enhance and conserve the vital fish and wildlife resources that exist on our military lands. The Department of Defense [DOD] manages nearly 25 million acres at approximately 900 military bases nationwide. These lands contain a wealth of plant and animal life, they provide vital habitat for thousands of migratory waterfowl and they are home for nearly 100 Federally listed species.  The Department does a superb job of training our young men and women for combat. Regrettably, they often fail to do even an adequate job of comprehensive natural resource management planning. At far too many installations, management plans have never been written, are outdated, or are largely ignored. Furthermore, when these plans do exist, all too often they are not coordinated or integrated with other military activities.  While this bill will make a number of improvements in the Sikes Act, it does not undermine in any way the fundamental training mission of a military base.  What the bill does is expand the scope of existing conservation plans to encompass all natural resource management activities, require management plans for all appropriate installations, mandate an annual report summarizing the status of these plans, require that trained personnel be available, and ensure that DOD shall manage each installation to provide for the conservation of fish and wildlife, and to allow the multipurpose uses of those resources. In addition, the bill extends the act's authorization for the next 3 years at half of its previous funding level.  Mr. Speaker, this is a noncontroversial bill. In fact, during the last Congress, it was thoroughly considered by both the House Resources and National Security Committees. It was approved by the House of Representatives unanimously by voice vote on July 11, 1995.  Regrettably, the other body took no action on this measure. While I am today introducing a bill that is identical to the one that was overwhelmingly adopted by the House, I am committed to reauthorizing this longstanding conservation measure. With that in mind, I intend to meet with representatives of the Departments of Defense and the Interior, the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, and members of the House National Security Committee. I am confident that together we can develop a strong and effective reauthorization bill.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife and Oceans, Jim Saxton, for joining with me in this effort and I commend the Sikes Act Improvement Amendments of 1997 to the membership of the House of Representatives.                          ____________________
