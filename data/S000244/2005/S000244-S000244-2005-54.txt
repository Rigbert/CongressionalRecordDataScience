Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment, which requires the Department of Homeland Security to report to Congress on the implementation of the employment eligibility verification system which this bill expands economy-wide.  One of the key components of this bill is a mandatory, national employment eligibility verification system. By checking the work authorization status of each person working in the U.S., we will finally be able to flush out the those working illegal.  We are expanding the Basic Pilot Program, which has worked extremely successfully as a voluntary program for 10 years.  Employers who use the Basic Pilot to conduct employment eligibility checks clearly like the system and that it is easy to use. A 2001 report found that ``an overwhelming majority of employers participating found the basic pilot program to be an effective and reliable tool for employment verification''--96 percent of employers found it to be an effective tool for employment verification; and 94 percent of employers believed it to be more reliable than the IRCA-required document check.  The system is available to employers both over the internet, and through a toll-free telephone number. Employers may use whichever option is more convenient.  As this system is expanded to a much larger scale, I am committed to working with the Department of Homeland Security and the business community to ensure that it works well and meets the needs of America's employers. I believe it is important that the verification process is user-friendly for all businesses--large and small.  This amendment would require DHS to report to Congress after the first and second years of implementation, and specifically address the concerns of businesses. These reports will assist Congress in monitoring the progress of the program.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
