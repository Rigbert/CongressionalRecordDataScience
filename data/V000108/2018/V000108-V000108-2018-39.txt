Speaker, it is with great respect and admiration that I take this time to honor Judge Julia Jent and to wish her well upon her retirement. For her lifetime of service, and truly inspiring career, Judge Jent is worthy of the highest praise. Among her numerous contributions to the community of Northwest Indiana, most impressive is her compassionate and unwavering commitment to our veterans. The Judge will oversee her final Veterans Treatment Court graduation on May 30, 2018, at Woodland Park in Portage, Indiana.  Judge Julia Jent was born in Germany and came to the United States in 1957 when she was adopted by a military family from Texas. At the age of eighteen, she joined the United States Army. It was during her time in the service that she met her husband, Jack Jent, a fellow servicemember. Following their time in the military, the couple eventually moved to Northwest Indiana where they raised four children. After years of working a few different jobs, Julia decided to continue her education. In 1979, she received a Bachelor's degree from Indiana University Northwest, and in 1982, she earned a law degree from Valparaiso University. Judge Jent worked thirteen years in private practice law, before she was appointed by former Governor Evan Bayh as Judge of the Porter Superior Court to fill the remainder of the term vacated by Judge Mary Harper, in 1997. She was then elected to a six-year term in 1998, and has presided over Porter Superior Court III for the past twenty-one years. In addition to her remarkable career, the Judge gives much of her time and efforts to numerous charitable and civic organizations, and for that she is to be commended.  Presiding as a Superior Court Judge, values such as respect for others, loyalty, and patriotism, instilled during her military service, as well as her concern for the veterans appearing before her bench, served as the motivation for Judge Jent to establish a Veterans Treatment Court in Porter County. Recognizing many of our veterans struggle with addiction, mental health, and other issues after their time in the service of our nation, Judge Jent knew a more effective solution to address the nonviolent criminal charges veterans faced as defendants was to create a framework based on partnerships to focus on the root problem, rather than incarceration, and the Veterans Treatment Court was established in 2011. This court system allows defendants to participate in programs, including treatment and mentoring, that will meet their individual needs and take one to two years to complete before their record is expunged. The numerous graduates of this program attest to its success, and to it saving their lives, thanks to the dedicated professionals who share Judge Jent's vision and her compassion and who work together to improve the lives of those in their community.  Personally, I have been blessed by the depth of Marge's kindness. I first met the Judge in early 1983 when I was an unemployed lawyer beginning to seek my way in the world. From the first time I met her and Jack, I was enveloped in their friendship and constant assistance. I could not have been successful without it. But my story is not unique, but only one of innumerable instances of Judge Julia Jent's empathy and kindness.  I am honored to call Julia Jent a friend. More importantly, Marge has been a friend to all, and the epitome of a public servant. Hers is a life we should all seek to emulate.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other colleagues join me in honoring Judge Julia Jent for her outstanding service to the people of Northwest Indiana and to wish her well upon her retirement. Judge Jent's impact on the region will be witnessed by generations to come, and for her many contributions, she is worthy of our gratitude and admiration.                          ____________________
