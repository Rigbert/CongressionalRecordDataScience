Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend, my colleague, Mr. Levin, for yielding. And thank you for all of your great and good work.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this bill. It is a very sad day for this body. Day in and day out, unemployed Americans beat the pavement applying for jobs everywhere and anywhere, sending hundreds of resumes applying for many jobs. These people lost their jobs through no fault of their own. They don't want a handout. They want a job.  In Atlanta we had a job fair where more than 4,500 people from as far away as New York showed up with the hope of just getting an interview. This bill is an insult to them. It is an affront to their dignity. It says that millions of Americans do not want to work or they are not searching hard enough for a job.  Instead of extending unemployment benefits before the holiday break, giving equal treatment for struggling Americans, as we do for the wealthy and large corporations, this legislation strips the program down to its bones. It's not right. It's not fair. It is not just.  This body represents the people, and we should not stomp on the souls of our fellow citizens. We can do better. We must do better. We must do better for the sake of our fellow citizens.  Mr. Speaker, is this the spirit of the season? Last night we offered an amendment to the Rules Committee that the Republicans refused to even consider. These amendments said, in effect, stop the politics, stop the games. Stand up for the people, for the people that voted for us, for our people that need our help. They are depending on us.
