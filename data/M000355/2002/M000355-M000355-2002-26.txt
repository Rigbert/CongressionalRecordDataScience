 President, today I pay tribute to a legend in the world of professional football, the late Johnny ``Golden Arm'' Unitas. I would also like to extend my most heartfelt condolences to his wife Sandy, his daughters Paige and Janice Ann, and his sons John, Kenneth, Robert, Christopher, Joe and Chad. I know my colleagues join me in expressing our gratitude for Johnny's many contributions.  Revered as the greatest quarterback of all time, Johnny was a man of incredible integrity and was a hero to many, both on and off the field. After graduating from St. Justin's High School in Pittsburgh, PA, where he got his start playing football as a sophomore, Johnny began to set his sights on college football. He found his niche at the University of Louisville. As quarterback for the university's football team, Johnny's skills and leadership demanded the attention of national recruiters. He was signed by the Baltimore Colts in 1956, and proved to be one of the team's greatest assets for 17 seasons.  His impressive accomplishments include throwing touchdown passes in a record 47 consecutive games and being the first quarterback in the NFL to pass a total of 40,000 yards. During his celebrated career in the NFL, Johnny received many of the game's highest awards. He was named Player of the Year in 1959, 1964 and 1967, was named Player of the Decade for the 1960s. On July 28, 1979, Johnny was enshrined into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was also named the Greatest Player in the First 50 years of Pro Football, was named to the NFLs 75th Anniversary Team, and had his number, 19, retired by the Baltimore Colts.  Indeed, Johnny Unitas will forever be considered one of the greatest football players in history. But his legacy doesn't end there. He was a down-to-earth role model who cherished interaction with teammates and younger players. In 1987, the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award was established in his name to honor the top senior quarterback in college football each year. Additionally, after completing his reign in the NFL, Unitas continued to visit Louisville to help his alma mater with anything he could.  I am certain that the legacy of excellence that Johnny Unitas has left will continue on, and will inspire others. On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the Senate, I offer my deepest condolences to Johnny's friends and loved ones, and express my gratitude for all he contributed to the University of Louisville, the National Football League and to our great Nation.                          ____________________
