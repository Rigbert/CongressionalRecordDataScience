I have been particularly advantaged as the minority whip with an extraordinary man who has worked for me now for 5 years. Prior to that, he worked for Dick Gephardt for many years and has been on this floor working on behalf of not only the majority side or the minority side, depending on what the Democrats were, but also in trying to make sure that this institution talked to one another and worked together as well as it possibly could.  He is going to be retiring now after 25 years of service to this institution. He's been a congressional staffer since 1983. He has served as floor director for the majority leader since January of 2007, myself. In that capacity, he has been responsible for scheduling bills and managing the daily legislative program. He's provided tremendous legislative advice to so many of you on the floor who have gone to him and asked him for his counsel. He's provided policy advice to our side of the aisle and policy discussion with your side of the aisle, and he has also been a communications counsel.  There is nobody who knows this young man who does not like him. He is a decent, good, very smart, wonderful human being.  He served as floor director in my office, as I said, for 4 years. Prior to that, Rob was the chief appropriations staffer for former Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt, and he also worked for Representatives Rosa DeLauro and Peter Visclosky. In those positions, his primary areas of focus included appropriations, global health, and foreign assistance.  During his career, Rob also worked for former Senator Brock Adams and former Representatives Jimmy Hayes, Cathy Long, and Gillis Long.  Rob is a graduate of the University of California Berkeley with a bachelor's degree in physiology and earned a master's in public policy at the University of Washington, and before that, was floor director for the Democratic whip's office.  All of us have deep affection for those people who spend extraordinary amounts of time at pay, which is not comparable to what they would be earning in the private sector. And I want to say, Rob Cogorno, to you, how very much I appreciate all that you have done for this institution, all that you have done for me as an individual, and I know I speak for all of the Members that we will greatly miss your advice and your counsel, your good humor and your good judgment. And we say to you, we wish you the very best of luck in everything you do.  I might also say that the young man who just gave me another piece of paper with some business is Rob's successor, and I urge Members of both sides of the aisle when he can be helpful to you, give you advice in terms of scheduling or the calendar in terms of when we are doing business, Alejandro Perez, my new floor director.                          ____________________
