 President, I made my comments this morning on the Reid amendment. I very strongly support it and I pointed out my rationale for so doing.  Since then, we have been reading the committee report, Mr. President, and something has come to my attention. In the spirit of debate and discussion which was so prevalent on the floor between the Senator from Pennsylvania and the distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, I would like to continue that spirit, and if the bill manager, the Senator from Pennsylvania, would be prepared to answer a question on the majority report, I would appreciate it very much.  In this report, on page 19, it is pointed out that some programs are exempted from this resolution and some are not. Now, this is news to me, because, as a member of the Judiciary Committee that considered this, that was not the case.  I would like to read the exact language. It reads:       Among the Federal programs that would not be covered by      S.J. Res. 1 is the electric power program of the Tennessee      Valley Authority. Since 1959, the financing of that program      has been the sole responsibility of its own electric      ratepayers--not the U.S. Treasury and the Nation's taxpayers.      Consequently, the receipts and outlays of that program are      not part of the problem S.J. Res. 1 is directed at solving.  Now, this is very strange to me. Social Security is put on budget and its receipts and outlays are subject to Senate Joint Resolution 1, but we suddenly find that the Tennessee Valley Authority is not. And not only is it not, but the words prefacing the statement say ``Among the Federal programs that would not be covered by Senate Joint Resolution 1 * * *''  My question to the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania is: A, are you aware of this, that the TVA is being exempted; and, B, what other programs are being exempted from Senate Joint Resolution 1?
