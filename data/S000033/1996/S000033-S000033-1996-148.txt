 Speaker, I am pleased today to join with Representative Rosa DeLauro in introducing ``The Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act of 1996'' to require insurers to pay for a minimum 2-day hospital stay for a mastectomy and a 1-day stay for a lymph node removal, unless the doctor and patient decide less time is appropriate. The legislation responds to a recent trend by insurers who are refusing to pay for an overnight stay for a woman with breast cancer who has had a mastectomy, the surgical removal of a breast, unless the doctor can prove it is ``medically necessary.''  While medical societies have no established guidelines on how long a woman should stay in the hospital following a mastectomy, doctors have argued that women need to stay 1 to 2 nights after such surgery. Surgeons have told me that the large majority of women would not do well going home the same day after such a surgery. It is unbelievable to me that the insurance industry is now considering mastectomy an ``outpatient procedure'' and denying women overnight stays.  After a mastectomy, a women has a large wound, still-attached drainage tubes and intravenous fluids, and, often times, excessive pain. Overnight stays allow doctors to address many of the problems that can arise in the 12 to 24 hours following surgery and allow women the time to learn how to care for the wound, handle the paint that accompanies such surgery and recover from the emotional trauma that can result from the surgery.  Outpatient mastectomies are disturbing new part of a growing trend in the insurance industry to deny care or truncate stays. First they denied insurance to victims of domestic violence, then they sent mothers and their newborn home within hours following a birth and now women with breast cancer are being denied the ability to have a very difficult surgery with some degree of dignity.  I have played an active role in ensuring that victims of domestic violence are no longer discriminated against in the health insurance industry and in guaranteeing that mothers and newborns are not sent home before they are ready to go. To that end, I will remain steadfast in my commitment to protect breast cancer patients from premature discharges from the hospital.  I am pleased that the National Breast Cancer Coalition has given its support to ``The Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act of 1996.'' I look forward to working together with the Breast Cancer Coalition, surgeons and medical societies to protect safe and appropriate care for cancer survivors.  The truth of the matter is that insurance companies are trampling on the sacred doctor-patient relationship and it must stop. The decision about when a woman should leave the hospital after a mastectomy should be made between the doctor and the woman, not by insurance companies bent on profits.  Congress must restore the doctor-patient relationship once and for all, and I am doing everything I can to see that that happens. In the meantime, this critical measure will protect thousands of women who confront breast cancer surgery from being forced out of the hospital against their will and against the best advice of their doctor.                          ____________________
