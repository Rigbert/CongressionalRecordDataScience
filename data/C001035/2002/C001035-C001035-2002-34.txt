It has been a pleasure to work with him and the Senator from Nebraska, as well as the Senator from Oregon, on this important amendment.  The Senator from Nebraska raised a very good point. This amendment has implications for all of our health care providers and that is why it enjoys such strong support of our nursing homes, of our hospitals--our rural hospitals are struggling with inadequate reimbursements--from disability advocates and the Visiting Nurse Associations.  But let's talk about what this means. We have talked about it being necessary to protect the most vulnerablein our society. Let's talk about what it means for some individual States.  I mentioned yesterday that this amendment would provide $54 million in much needed relief to my home State of Maine. That would help avoid the necessity for draconian cuts in essential social service programs such as our Medicaid Program. But let's look at a few other States.  For Alabama, for example, this would mean $92.6 million; for Alaska, it would be $32.2 million; for Arizona, $144 million; for Arkansas, $80 million.  Let me skip down a bit. For Florida, $359 million; for Georgia, $208 million; for Hawaii, $28 million; for Idaho, $28.6 million. Indeed, the Governor of Idaho, our former colleague, Governor Kempthorne, has worked very hard as an advocate for this important legislation.  In other words, every single State in the Nation would be by this amendment provided with much needed relief. That is why we need to act. Otherwise, States are going to have no choice but to slash essential programs.  We have new figures coming out today that show the fiscal crisis affecting our partners, the States, has widened still further. According to the National Conference of State Legislators, States have used up two-thirds of their cash on hand. The gap between revenues and spending has hit $36 billion and is expected to be $58 billion, affecting 46 States. We must act. I urge my colleagues to reject the point of order.
