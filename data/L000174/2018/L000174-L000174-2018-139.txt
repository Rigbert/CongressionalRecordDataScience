Hester ``Hep'' Caldwell, who died on April 10, 2018, will be forever remembered and admired for a life well lived.  Hep, who lived to be 89, was one of those people who just about everybody liked immediately. She loved people, she loved sports, she loved the outdoors, and she loved living on West Hill in Putney, VT, with her husband, John, whom she first met when they were both just 10 years old.  For decades, Hep taught history and John taught mathematics at the Putney School. Besides challenging her students in the classroom, Hep's many passions--hiking, skiing, gardening, classical music--inspired all who knew her. She set an example for generations, young and old, in her home, in the classroom, in woods, fields, and on the slopes and summits of mountains in all seasons of the year and by her many years of community service.  Putney will not be the same without Hep, but she has left her mark there and in her children and grandchildren in ways that will live on for generations.  I ask unanimous consent that Hep Caldwell's obituary in the Valley News be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From Valley News, Apr. 22, 2018]                       Hester Goodenough Caldwell       Putney, VT.--Hester Goodenough Caldwell, born Nov. 30,      1928, died on Tuesday, April 10, 2018. Hep died as she lived:      sustained by her love for her family and her ability to meet      challenges with laughter and quick wit. Hep was born in      Woodbridge, Conn. to Erwin and Helen Goodenough. She grew up      loving the outdoors and playing alongside her three older      brothers and male cousins, excellent preparation for her      future schooling and her later ability to simultaneously      embrace and challenge traditional gender roles. At the age of      10 she entered Putney School, where she met the boy she would      later wed, John Caldwell. After graduating from Smith College      in 1950 and marrying John, she returned to Putney School in      1953, where she taught history for 37 years even as she      raised four children and earned her Master of Arts in Liberal      Studies from Wesleyan University. During her tenure at Putney      School, Hep also held a variety of positions including head      of the history department, dean of faculty, field hockey      coach, and ski coach. An avid hiker, she led student ski      trips to Tuckerman's Ravine, drawing on her years of skiing      for Putney School and on the ski patrol at Smith. Together,      Hep and John exemplified partnership as they raised their      four children, worked at Putney School, and traveled to      Switzerland, France, Italy, Austria, Finland, Norway,      Australia, Tonga, Wales, England, Japan, Yugoslavia, China      and Russia on learning, hiking and skiing expeditions.       In their later years, Hep and John became co-sponsors of      Camp Caldwell, a series of mini-camps for their 10      grandchildren, where they nurtured family ties, promoted the      benefits of physical labor, and cultivated a respect and love      for the natural world. In the spirit of 5:00 AM barn duty at      the Putney School, the little grandkid campers could not have      7 AM breakfast until they had dipped in the icy cold spring-     fed pond at the bottom of the hill, which of course Hep and      John had done themselves an hour or so earlier. Other camp      activities ranged from ``waking up the chickens and feeding      them'' to drawing straws to see which pair would have to wade      into the swamp mud to remove the water-cress that had      infested the pond's water. Now adults, some of the grandkids'      fondest memories include their time together with Hep and      John.       Hep contributed significantly to her community, serving as      a founding member of the new Putney Library, Chairperson of      Brattleboro Community Chorus, head of the Putney's Democratic      Party and as a Justice of the Peace, presiding over scores of      marriages. Inspiring her children, grandchildren and students      to do good in this world, lifting hearts with her piano      playing, Hep's legacy lives on in her children and      grandchildren, all of whom love skiing and other outdoor      activities, many of whom are engaged in teaching and      coaching.       Hep faced old-age challenges in her final years, but she      never lost her quick laugh and ability to find levity in      whatever was happening around her. She was pre-deceased by      her daughter, Jennifer and her brother, Ward. She will be      greatly missed by her husband, John, her three children, Tim,      Sverre, and Peter and her ten grandchildren, Tyler, Alexa,      Anya, Lucy, Sophie, Lucinda, Heidi, Austin, Isabel, and      Patrick, and her brothers, John and Jim. A gathering to      reflect on and celebrate her life will be held at the Putney      School Aug. 4.                          ____________________
