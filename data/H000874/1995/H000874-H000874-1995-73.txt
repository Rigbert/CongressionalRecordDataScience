Speaker, the gentleman from Arizona says it is not a cut. Then how come in their budget they count money from the EITC toward balancing the budget? Is that Washington-speak reform?  Ms. DeLAURO. Just one more sham.  Let me tell you what this is about. It is not about a balanced budget. That is not what the issue is about today. It is about holding the President of the United States hostage to a set of Republican budget assumptions which say that what we ought to do is to cut $270 billion in Medicare, throw senior citizens in this country in disarray and provide devastating cuts, increase their premiums, and deny them their choice of doctors. That is what they want to do. They want to cut Medicaid, which allows nursing home coverage. That is one issue, one area that this is about, and holding the President hostage.  The President is right. The President is absolutely right in saying ``no'' to $270 billion in Medicare cuts, ``no'' no to the slashing of education benefits for our young people.  I do not know how all of you got to school. I went to school with student loans. We are about to cut student loans and deny working middle-class families in this country the opportunity to send their kids to school.  They would like to hold the President hostage on those assumptions. The President has said ``no'' to that. He is right to do it.
