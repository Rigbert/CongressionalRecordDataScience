 President, no one asked for a study on pornography. No one asked for that. I did not hear anybody stand up here and say, ``Let's have a study on pornography. I wish to stop pornography on the Internet.'' I did not hear anybody say, ``Let's not do it. Let's have a study.'' When it comes to a bomb, teaching our kids how to make bombs, we want to study it.
