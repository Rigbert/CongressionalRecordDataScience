Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I would also like to add to my first statement a little bit of litany of Mr. Hyde. He was my neighbor right next door to 2111 in the Rayburn Building. He was always good for a conversation but, most of all, good advice. He also has been one that has protected, or at least protected the unborn, and he has been to my State numerous times and has spoken eloquently and with forcefulness about their need to be protected.  He has been a friend of this body because he brought dignity, as I mentioned before, and the prestige of a gentleman but, more than that, a very intellectual individual that understood the issues.  So I am extremely proud today to support this legislation. I hope all my colleagues understand that we are losing a good colleague. Some of my colleagues that have left prior to this were not recognized by naming a room. It is just a small token of appreciation to someone who brought the needed, I think, gentlemanness to this body.  So it is with great honor that I support this legislation again.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
