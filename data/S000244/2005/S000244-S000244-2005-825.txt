Chairman, let me say that I think the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions) has spotted a loophole in our current law and the vulnerability for aircraft that are not passenger aircraft in nature.  An aircraft that is brought down by a laser will kill people just as dead if they have passengers on it or if it is a cargo plane or general aviation aircraft or a government plane. I think people who shine lasers into cockpits of planes should have to face the music with criminal charges whether the planes are carrying passengers or not, and I think the amendment is a good one and ought to be adopted.
