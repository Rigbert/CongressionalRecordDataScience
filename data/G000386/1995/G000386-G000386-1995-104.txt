 President, just for a couple of minutes to respond to what the Senator from New York had to say, I would very readily admit that a certain amount of flexibility under the 1988 act gave States the opportunity to change their plan and come to Washington and request waivers. It gave us an opportunity for the political laboratories of our system of Government, our State legislatures, to try something new and to experiment. Most of those States participating have been very successful. I think my State of Iowa has been the most successful.  But I think that what we have seen is two phenomenon which dictates to me that we ought to move more aggressively toward flexibility to the States. The No. 1 thing is a dramatic increase in the number of people on welfare, 3.1 million now since the 1988 act went into effect. There was some leeway to States in that act that gave them an opportunity to make it possible for more people to get on welfare. I do not know whether that was intended or not, but it was an end result. So we have 3.1 million more people on welfare. The second phenomenon is that it is costing more money, and I think at a time when we thought we were passing an act that was going to save some money, that tells me, as I look back to my involvement with the 1988 Act, that I failed in making that judgment.  In the meantime, we have seen several States move dramatically forward, move people from welfare to work, save their taxpayers' money, and save the Federal taxpayers some money as well. And in that 7-year period of time, it has given me, and others of my colleagues, encouragement to have more faith in the States to do things even more dramatic and dynamic than they have done thus far under waivers.  I would suggest that if there is one reason that I wish to be able to move forward based upon the success of the Iowa legislature and their plan, it is the fact that, in my judgment, that Iowa would have gone much, much further in reforming welfare if they did not have to tailor a program that would meet the requirements of some obscure bureaucrat in the Department of HHS in order to get approval. So that is why Republicans have a bill that gives so much more authority to the States than ever before.  I will admit, in conclusion, that the stage was set for it by the 1988 Family Support Act; but it set a stage that tells us now that we can do even more than what we could do under the 1988 act and we ought to do it.  I yield the floor.                           Amendment No. 2529
