Adalbert Parish. On October 28, 2007, Saint Adalbert Parish in Toledo, Ohio celebrated its naissance into the north Toledo Polish Community. This 100th anniversary commemorates the formative role St. Adalbert's had in helping shape a vibrant Toledo, while centering an ethnic community of largely citizens of Polish descent. The celebration, commenced with Mass, reminded those attendees of their proud Polish heritage that molded north Toledo, but also northwest Ohio. For this celebration marked a day that spoke to the importance of commemorating important ethnic communities in America because these immigrant-based groups have enriched America's heritage.  Approximately 170 years ago, the banks of the Maumee River welcomed the first Polish immigrant with the family name Vistula, a name shared with the central river of Poland. Following this initial arrival, Toledo attracted more Polish pioneers from Krakow, the medieval capital of Poland and from Warsaw, Poland's current capital in the Mazowsze region. However, during the 19th century, the overwhelming majority of Polish settlers came from the western territories. These western territories of Poland were controlled by the Germans. Poles longed to escape the religious and linguistic persecution of the infamous ``Kulturkamt instituted by Otto von Bismarck, subsequently followed by the ``Ha-Ka-Ta'' program of colonization by buying up Polish lands.  The specific origins of Poles fleeing German maltreatment are known. Most came from Poznan province, the seat of Poland's earliest Roman Catholic cathedral. Other Poles came from the Pa5uki region around the county of Znin. This region rests immediately to the northwest of the Kujawy region around Gniezno. Upon finding a sight of white eagleshere, Prince Lech established this as the capital and further, the white eagle became the national coat-of-arms.  Additionally, Poles migrated to America at the beginning of the 20th Century through the First World War. They arrived from the Austrian-held southern Poland, Zakopane with Gorale culture, Rzeszow, Lwow, Russian territories of Kujawy, and Wi5no, the modern capital of Lithuania.  Regardless of their ancestral region, Polish immigrants contributed greatly to Toledo's growing labor forces. By 1920, people of Polish origin constituted the largest foreign-born group in Toledo and Lucas County. These settlers accounted for at least one quarter of the population of northwest Ohio, eventually spilling over into southeastern Michigan. Toledo was the largest city in northwest Ohio with a population of over 300,000 people. Residents of Polish ancestry now number over 60,000.  Given Poland's special relationship with the Catholic Church, when Poles came to inhabit Toledo, naturally, the Catholic Church became the bastion of their communities. Indeed its establishment predated the formation of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Toledo itself. By 1879, the Lagrange street district (known as ``Lagrinka'' by Poles) hosted the first Polish parish under the patronage of Saint Hedwig, Queen of Poland. The Polish Lagrinka district rapidly expanded into the beginning of the 20th century. By 1907, Bishop Ignatius Horstmann of Cleveland established a second Polish parish in the Lagrange Street district as a division of St. Hedwig Parish. The bishop assigned Fr. Jozef Wachowski, a young priest who worked in Cleveland, to begin the new parish by October 18, 1907 with Park Street as the boundary line. The old church building of St. Hedwig housed the first parish meeting on February 23, 1908.  By March 4, 1908, Bishop Horstmann approved the choice of St. Adalbert as the namesake and patron of the new parish. The official announcement of the parish patron saint was made on March 15, 1908. A nine-room cottage on the property was used as the pastor's house. By November of 1908, Fr. Wachowski signed a contract for a combination church/school building, and a pastoral residence. The first spade of ground for the new church was turned on December 1, 1908, at 12 o'clock noon.  Auxiliary Bishop Joseph Kudelka laid the cornerstone on May 2, 1909. Representatives of all the Polish parishes in the Toledo and Rossford areas, and parishes from Ironville in east Toledo attended this ceremony. The church school was finished in October 1909. Work started on the rectory in February of 1909. A demonstration of Catholic Polish people which has never been equaled in Toledo took place Sunday, September 18, 1910 when the Right Reverend Bishop from Chicago dedicated St. Adalbert Church and School on Lagrange and Oakland Streets. The parade to follow showcased all societies, military and religious, of all the Polish churches. Bishop Paul P. Rhode was the first and only Polish bishop in the United States, leading nearly 3,000,000 Catholic Poles and more than 800 churches. By October 1909, Fr. Wachowski moved into the new rectory, followed by a sister's convent in 1915.  St. Adalbert Parish eventually became the largest parish in the diocese; thus, it was necessary to build a new, separate church to sustain the parish members. On April 19, 1927, parish supporters laid the cornerstone to the present magnificent church. This church, built between the church-school and the parish house in the Spanish Mission style, was 145 feet long and 75 feet wide with a 100-foot tower at one side. September 18, 1927 celebrated the first Mass of the new church. The new St. Adalbert Church was dedicated by Bishop Samuel A. Stritch on April 22, 1928, which also marked the 25th anniversary of Fr. Wachowski's ordination to the priesthood.  After the new church was built, the Great Depression came. Father Czarnecki inherited the debt of the church building. However, Fr. Czarnecki introduced and distributed financial booklets to list all the contributions of each member during the year. Due to the priest's business acumen, the building debt was paid.  Parishioners of Saint Adalbert have been involved in numerous organizations. These members of the parish organized a number of societies: St. Adalbert Society, St. Casmir's and St. Joseph's Societies, St. Michael Society (men), Altar-Rosary Society (women), and Young Ladies Society (girls), St. Theresa and Holy Rosary Sodalities, the Ladies' Guild, the Young People's Friendly Circle, the Catholic Order of Foresters, Court No. 1865, LCBA Branch No. 1434 and the Altar Boys' League. From these organizations and tight-knit community, Saint Adalbert was an anchor for the neighborhood.  The church buttressed a parish school that became a site of advancement for young people for generations. The selfless contributions of the teachers, more notably, the Felician Sisters ensured the students received a top-notch education, but nurtured students who were dedicated and devoted to serve their fellow man, community and country. Rev. J.P. Wachowski requested the services of the Felician Sisters. The future welfare of the Polish pioneers lay in their education and training by a religious community of their own nationality. Retaining some ethnic identity was essential for those separated from their mother country by a force of circumstances. The Felician Sisters have taught in Toledo since 1883, nine years after five Sisters arrived in Polania, Wisconsin from Poland to establish the first U.S. Foundation. The religious community was founded in Warsaw, Poland in 1855 by Mother M. Angela, eventually being housed in Livonia, Michigan in 1936. The sisters became an integral part of the community, the elementary schools, high schools, religious education centers, parish religious programs, a college hospital, home for dependent children and a home for the aged. The Congregation of Sisters of Saint Felix has been teaching at the St. Adalbert Parish for 98 years.  The original St. Adalbert Parish attracted about 150 families. Upon completion of the new parish, more than 1,000 families claimed Saint Adalbert as their parish. Presently, approximately 550 household families are registered at St. Adalbert Parish.  In lieu of current trends of former vibrant Polish communities, two parishes were superfluous to meet the needs of the community. Thus, to keep alive the Polish churches of North Toledo, in July of 2005, St. Adalbert Parish and St. Hedwig Parish were twinned, staying separate parishes but one community. What once partitioned the north Toledo Polish neighborhood has now become united. In fact, the parish schools of Saint Hedwig and Saint Adalbert joined, creating Pope John Paul II School, tangibly representing this union.  Indeed the story of 100 years of activity can never be told in its entirety; but the contributions of the Felicians, priests and laity, who served as lectors, ushers, Eucharistic ministers, choir members, musicians, youth athletic coaches, and skit, dance and musical choreographers nurtured the joy of community commemorated during its 100th anniversary.  October 2007 marks the 100th anniversary of St. Adalbert Parish. A year-long celebration begins with the blessing of the statue of our late Pope John Paul II. May God bless St. Adalbert Parish--all its founders and inheritors--and our beloved community, and city.                          ____________________
