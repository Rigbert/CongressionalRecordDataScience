President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators Collins, Schumer, Sanders and Gillibrand as we introduce this legislation to hold accountable those criminals who fraudulently sell what they call ``maple'' syrup.  Vermont iconic maple syrup--painstakingly produced, and prized across the Nation and beyond--is one of our state's fine, high-quality, natural products. I have been alarmed by the growing number of individuals and businesses claiming to sell genuine Vermont maple syrup when they are in fact selling an inferior product that is not maple syrup at all. This is fraud, plain and simple, and it undermines a key part of Vermont's economy and reputation for quality that has been hard-earned through Vermonters' hard work. I know that diligent syrup producers in Maine, New York, and other States have been similarly hurt by this crime. Our bill, the Maple Agriculture Protection and Law Enforcement, or ``MAPLE''Act, will deter this criminal conduct.  The MAPLE Act creates a felony offense with a 5-year maximum penalty for fraudulently selling a product purported to be maple syrup that is not, in fact, maple syrup. Under current law, doing so is only a misdemeanor offense with a one year penalty.  The sale of fraudulent maple syrup is a real problem facing consumers and producers. Recently, Vermont U.S. Attorney Tris Coffin sought an indictment after a Food and Drug Administration investigation revealed that a Rhode Island man had been selling cane sugar-based syrup as ``maple'' syrup and representing to consumers that the syrup was authentic. The legislation we introduce today will more effectively protect consumers and the maple industry by punishing and deterring this deceptive conduct.  Vermonters, and consumers across the country, should be confident that when they buy food, they know exactly what they are getting. The fines that may result from criminal violations under current law are often not enough to protect the public from harmful or fraudulent products. Too often, those who are willing to endanger our livelihoods in pursuit of their profits see fines as just a cost of doing business. We need to make sure that those who intentionally deceive consumers get a trip to jail, not a slap on the wrist. Schemers should not easily be able to sully the seal of quality that is associated with genuine Vermont maple syrup.  I have a longstanding commitment to comprehensive food safety and food integrity reforms, and our work is not done. Earlier this year, the Senate unanimously passed my Food Safety Accountability Act, which would hold those criminals who intentionally poison our food supply accountable for their crimes. I urge the House to pass that noncontroversial bill, and I hope that all Senators will join us in supporting the MAPLE Act.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1742       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
