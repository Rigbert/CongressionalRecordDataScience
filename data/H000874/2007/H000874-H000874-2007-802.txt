, House of Representatives.  Jerry joined the Office of the Law Revision Counsel in 1976, just two years after it was established, and we've been lucky enough to have him here with us ever since.  Throughout his career, Jerry has been an indispensable member of a small but essential group of nonpartisan professionals who prepare and publish the United States Code and draft legislation to improve the codification of federal law. He has played an important role in maintaining the Code from year to year, and Jerry has used his expansive wealth of legislative knowledge to guide and train each and every attorney that is currently charged with updating the laws of our land.  In 1997, Jerry rose to his current position of Deputy Law Revision Counsel, and his leadership, expertise and tireless efforts have been invaluable in ensuring the accuracy and quality of the volumes that govern every aspect of American life.  Jerry's easygoing demeanor, patient manner and high standards are greatly appreciated by his colleagues and those of us who have had the pleasure of getting to know him over these last 30 years. And when he thinks back on his time in the People's House, I know he will do so with all the pride and satisfaction that accompany an outstanding career of public service,  Later this month, Jerry will retire to Richmond, Virginia, where he plans to continue his love of golf and spend more time with his family. But before he goes, I want to congratulate Jerry Director on a wonderful career and wish him all the best as he embarks on the next--and hopefully, the most fulfilling--chapter of his life.                          ____________________
