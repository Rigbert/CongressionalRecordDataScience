 President, I rise today to express my support for the Social Security ``lock box.'' This legislation is vital to the future of the Social Security program. I commend my colleagues, Senators Domenici, Abraham, and Ashcroft on their leadership and dedication to the fiscal year 2000 budget resolution which establishes goalsfor the next ten years by setting aside projected Social Security surpluses of $1.8 trillion.  The unified budget system created during President Lyndon Johnson's administration allows the government to account for non-Social Security programs using Social Security funds. For years it masked the size of the federal deficit. When it comes to Social Security, this accounting method has fanned unfavorable public sentiment. According to a survey conducted by the National Public Radio, the Kaiser Foundation, and the Kennedy School of Government, Americans believe that the Social Security trust fund is somehow being misused. Asked why the system is in trouble, more people (65%) selected ``money in the Social Security trust fund is being spent on programs other than Social Security'' than any other reason. It's time to change the system. The lock box legislation would help restore the public's trust in the system and ensure Congress and the President don't squander the surpluses accumulating in the Social Security trust fund.  The surplus could be very tempting to the President and Congress to spend. The Social Security ``lock box'' would institute a 60-vote budget point of order in the Senate which would limit Congress's ability to pass a budget resolution which uses a portion of the Social Security trust fund for non-Social Security purposes. In addition, this legislation would institute a limit on the debt held by the public.  Passing this legislation demonstrates Congress's ability and discipline to save money. Taxpayers and beneficiaries believe ``reform'' will translate into higher taxes and lower benefits. One way to quell public concern is by starting out on the right foot. We can protect the Social Security trust fund from being drained for non-Social Security purposes. As Members of Congress, we owe this to the future generations of America. As Senators, we should understand the dynamics of saving the Social Security trust funds because we all have constituents in our home states who have doubts about Social Security money being there for them when they retire. That is why this legislation is so important: it will help restore the confidence of the American people in their government. Locking away the Social Security trust fund is a key way to secure the public's peace of mind. Wage earners who contribute a sizable percentage of their paycheck every week to the public retirement system have grown leery about the Federal Government using their Social Security taxes for other purposes.  President Clinton, pledged in his 1998 State of the Union Address, to ``save every cent of the Social Security Surplus.'' Some Members of Congress including myself along with Senators Gregg, Breaux, and Kerrey have put forth proposals to save Social Security. However, if Congress and the White House reach a Social Security stalemate this year, the lock box legislation offers a bonus economic benefit. It would ensure the public debt is reduced. That's because the Social Security lock box effectively would limit the amount of public debt, which would prevent Social Security revenue from being used for other programs.  Some have expressed concern that passing this legislation would stifle Congress's ability to address emergency situations such as economic recession or war. Those situations were anticipated in the development of the lock box legislation. This bill would allow the flexibility necessary to address such situations by suspending the public debt limit in specific instances such as recession or a declaration of war.  We are at a point in time where talk is cheap and execution is everything. At one time or another we all learned the steps of first aid and the first step that is taken is to stop the bleeding. We need to stop the bleeding of the trust fund dollars from the Social Security trust fund.  I ask my colleagues to demonstrate the courage necessary to pass this bill and preserve the future of our great Nation.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
