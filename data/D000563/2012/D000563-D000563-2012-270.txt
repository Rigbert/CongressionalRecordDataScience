President, the horrific shooting that happened last week in Aurora, CO has shocked our Nation. Our hearts and our prayers go out to the victims, to their loved ones, and to all those whose lives have been forever marred by this tragedy. Twelve have died, and 58 more have been injured, many seriously.  We certainly give thanks to the first responders and to the medical personnel who responded so quickly and so capably. Most of all, we mourn those who we have lost.  Sadly, no state in our Union is immune to the horror of lives cut short by violence. In my State of Illinois, there have been too many lives lost, too many families shattered, too many children caught in the crossfire in my hometown of East St. Louis and some neighborhoods of Chicago.  The tragic mass shooting in Aurora has sent ripples of sadness and loss far beyond Colorado. For many people in Illinois, the scene last Friday was sickeningly familiar. A little over 4 years ago, a mentally disturbed gunman walked into a lecture hall at Northern IL University in DeKalb, IL, and opened fire. He killed 5 people, and injured 21 more. We in Illinois know something about the grief Coloradans are feeling after last Friday's mass shooting, and we grieve with them.             Petty Officer John Larimer of Crystal Lake, IL   We were saddened to hear that a young man from Illinois was among those killed in Aurora. U.S. Navy PO3 John Larimer of Crystal Lake, IL, was a fourth-generation Navy man.  He joined the Navy last year and trained at the Naval Station Great Lakes near Chicago. He was a cryptologic technician. He was stationed at Buckley Air Force Base in Aurora, where he was assigned to the U.S. Fleet Cyber Command. Last week Petty Officer Larimer went to the movies with his girlfriend, Julia Vojtsek, a nurse who grew up in Algonquin, Illinois. When the shooting started, John Larimer shielded Julia's body with his own. Julia said that John ``held myhead, and protected my whole body with his, and saved me.'' John Larimer was a brave man who died a hero. He was 27 years old.  His commanding officer, Commander Jeffrey Jakuboski, said the following of Larimer:       He was an outstanding shipmate. A valued member of our Navy      team, he will be missed by all who knew him.  Over the weekend, John Larimer was remembered by friends and family for his intelligence, his good nature, his compassion, and his dedication to his family, his community and his country.  Family members spoke of his ``incredible mind'' and ``quiet gentleness.'' John's English teacher at Crystal Lake South High School remembered a good student who was ``incredibly bright and firm in his ideals.'' He said John ``was a good, strong human being . . . and I know he would have done incredible things for our country.'' To his high school principal, John Larimer was ``just a great kid to be around.''  Whether it was giving a big tip to a neighborhood kid who sold him a lemonade, or sending letters to the local newspaper calling for tolerance and respect for the views of others, John Larimer inspired those around him through the way he lived his life. And now he has inspired us with the way he died, literally sacrificing his life to save another.  His passing is a heartbreaking loss to the community of Crystal Lake, to Illinois, and to our country. I offer my condolences to John's parents, his brother and his three sisters. All of us will keep John, his family and his loved ones in our thoughts and prayers.  A night out at the movies is supposed to be a joyful event. That it could end in such a horrific scene reminds us how precious and fragile life is.  In the days and weeks to come, we will learn more about what happened in Aurora and whether there was any point at which this disturbed gunman could have been identified and stopped.  There will inevitably be discussions about whether we need to change any of our laws or policies. We owe it to the victims and their loved ones to see that those debates are guided by an honest assessment of the facts, what it will take to keep us safe in America, safe from the gunman who walks into a classroom at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb or the gunman who walks into a crowded theater in Aurora CO.  I came out of church yesterday, and a woman came up to me and said: They are talking about putting metal detectors in movie theaters now. What is next?  I said, sadly: I am not sure. I don't know where we will turn next to keep America safe from people who misuse firearms, assault rifles, a 100-round clip of ammunition.  All of these things are raising questions in the minds of everyone about where is it safe anymore.  I said to this woman outside our church: There was a big crowd sitting in that church today, too. Just as in that movie theater, we all thought we were safe until this happened.  For today we pause, not to enter into a debate about these important issues, which we must face, but to remember and honor those who died, to offer our condolences to those who were left behind, and to pray for the recovery of all those who were wounded and those who have suffered. We wish them comfort in this difficult time.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
