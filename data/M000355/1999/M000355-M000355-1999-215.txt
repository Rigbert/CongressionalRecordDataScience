 I have listened very carefully to his remarks, and I commend him for his tireless efforts in supporting children's causes, here in the United States and throughout the world. I would like to assure him that I will give every possible consideration to his request when we go to conference.  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my distinguished friend from Kentucky, and I yield the floor.                          ____________________
