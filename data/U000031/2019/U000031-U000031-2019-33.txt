Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the DERA Coalition in support of H.R. 1768 on the Diesel Emission Reduction Act.             Diesel Emission Reduction Act (DERA) Coalition  Please Support One of the Nation's Most Effective Clean Air Programs       When it comes to improving air quality for communities      across the country, one of the most effective strategies is      to replace older heavy-duty vehicles and equipment with new      and much cleaner options. That is the goal of the Diesel      Emission Reduction Act (DERA) program managed by U.S.      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We urge you to support      continuation of the program as provided under Matsui-Long      reauthorization bill (H.R. 1768) which would deliver vital      air quality improvements to your constituents.       Four out of every ten Americans reside in a region with      unhealthy air, according to EPA. The American Lung      Association estimates that air quality for many regions      around the country is not improving. DERA helps communities      clean up their air by replacing older trucks, buses, and      equipment with newer, cleaner technologies. Replacing just      one Class 8 truck with a new model can eliminate tons of      emissions. DERA also enjoys broad bipartisan support, along      with support from a long list of business interests and      environmental and health advocates, including those      signatories below.       According the EPA's latest report to Congress on the      program issued in July of this year, since DERA's funding was      first appropriated in 2008, more than 67,000 vehicles and      engines have been upgraded or replaced, delivering $19      billion in direct health benefits. Those benefits include      eliminating 15,490 tons of fine particles and 427,700 tons of      nitrogen oxides, a smog forming compound. That works out to      just about the same emission reductions as taking more than      236 million cars off the road for a year.       The program provides just enough funding to encourage      owners to make a smart investment in their purchase of      cleaner and often more fuel-efficient vehicles and equipment.      As a result, every $1 in public funds appropriated through      the DERA program is leveraged with an additional $3 in      nonfederal funds, generating between $11 and $30 in public      health benefits and an additional $2 in fuel savings.       While DERA has been around since 2008, there still is much      to be done. Heavy-duty trucks and off-road equipment are      built to last, meaning a large fleet of older and higher      emitting trucks remain in service. Only four in ten trucks on      the road today is equipped with technologies to achieve the      latest near-zero tailpipe emissions standard set by EPA.      Research shows that off-road equipment, including      locomotives, are of an even older generation technology and      will be in the field for decades to come. DERA provides the      funding needed to incentivize the replacement of those older      and higher emitting vehicles and equipment. The program is      voluntary, competitive, and technology neutral, allowing      funding to be used for projects, advanced locally, that      provide the highest benefits for the amount of funding      requested.       The Diesel Emission Reduction Act has proved to be one of      the most effective tools to generate short-term air quality      and health benefits for local communities across the country,      but those benefits cannot be sustained without proper      funding. We encourage you to support extending the      authorization of this cost-effective and environmentally      impactful program for an additional five years as provided      for under the bill.
