Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the Senate bill (S. 1888) to amend title 18 of the United States Code to correct a technical error in the codification of title 36 of the United States Code.  The Clerk read as follows:                                S. 1888       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. TECHNICAL CORRECTION OF ERROR IN THE CODIFICATION                    OF TITLE 36.       Section 2320(e)(1)(B) of title 18, United States Code, is      amended by striking ``section 220706 of title 36'' and      inserting ``section 220506 of title 36''.
