Leader, I think I am correct that every tax bill that we have passed over the last 3 years has been sunsetted. Therefore, pursuant to your rationale on child tax credit, in effect those bills would be raising taxes, sometimes in 2010, sometimes a little before, and sometimes a little after, 2006, 2007 some sunset. How does that rationale differ from the rationale being applied to the child tax credit?  Mr. DeLAY. Madam Speaker, it is pretty simple. The House has voted for a bill which covers more families than the Senate bill, and we think that they ought to receive that child tax credit, and they ought to receive it on a permanent basis. The House has spoken, and the Senate does not seem to want to come together with the House and work out our differences.
