``Trish'' Andre of Wauseon, Ohio, who left this world for a higher grace-filled existence on Friday, August 2, 2019.  As we remember Trish, we are reminded of a life dedicated to our earth's fabric in agriculture. A graduate of Purdue University, her academic studies were based in science where she received a degree in Agronomy. Serving as a Certified Crop Advisor, a 4-H Advisor, a member of the Ohio Jersey Breeder's Association, and a member of the Farm Bureau, Trish led an extraordinary life dedicated to agriculture.  I can still see her stooping in the fields picking off tiny creatures on plants, studying their meaning, marveling at nature and its infinite connection to a higher cosmos. Her work raising the next generation of her own family and the larger 4-H youth family is legendary. She was a prophetess in her own time.  Trish's deep dedication to agriculture was shared with her loving husband of 34 years, Nathan (Nate) L. Andre who survives her. Nate and Trish formed a strong bond in marriage and as agricultural stewards. He is a proud organic and fanning consultant for Andre Farms, a family-owned business that has served Ohio and Michigan communities for over 60 years. I know Nate will honor his wife's memory by upholding the Andre Farms' mission of integrity driven land stewardship.  As a parishioner of the North Clinton Church in Wauseon, Ohio, Trish was a devout woman of faith. As a member of Gideon International Auxiliary, a Christian nonprofit, and a Bible Quiz Coach, her service to community was firmly rooted in faith.  Trish will be profoundly missed by her friends, family, and the community she served.My thoughts and prayers are with Nate, their children Perry, Kira, and Ross, and her granddaughter Esther. Although their beloved Trish was taken well before her time, may they find peace in knowing she is peacefully at rest in the earth she faithfully tended. Now her power for betterment of life on earth assumes new dimension and one that is eternal. May God provide her angelic spirit soft clouds and rising suns so her goodness showers upon humankind in unending waves.                          ____________________
