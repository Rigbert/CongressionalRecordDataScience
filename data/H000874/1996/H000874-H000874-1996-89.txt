Chairman, I subscribe to the remarks the gentleman just made.  Obviously, this committee has not addressed this issue. Having said that, just as obviously the proponents of this amendment I think have a proposition with which all of us would agree, and do agree, and this is an issue which we are going to have to study between now and conference from a substantive standpoint.  The chairman points out correctly that regulations in this area, vis-a-vis Medicare and Medicaid, as I understand, have taken even longer than 1994 to date and antedate that by some time.  Having said that, I think clearly the objective that the two gentlemen seek is an objective that is an important one and which I think all of us support.
