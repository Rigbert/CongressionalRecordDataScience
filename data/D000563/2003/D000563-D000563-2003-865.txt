Inspired by an Illinois native, Dr. Carter G. Woodson, the month of February allows Americans an opportunity to honor and celebrate the achievements African Americans have made to our country.  Earning his bachelors and master's degrees from the University of Chicago, Dr. Woodson feared that the history of African Americans was quickly fading into obscurity. Realizing that past contributions by African Americans needed to be documented and taught, Dr. Woodson devoted his time popularizing Black history amongst the masses. He concluded, ``if a race had no recorded history, its achievements would be forgotten and, in time, claimed by other groups.'' In 1915, Dr. Woodson founded the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History, ASNLH, and in 1916 they released the first publication of the Journal of Negro History, a publication for which Dr. Woodson served as editor and director until his death in 1950.  In 1926, Dr. Woodson established Negro History Week, which expanded to Black History Month in 1976. Thanks to the efforts and achievements of Dr.Woodson and others, each year our Nation celebrates the history of African Americans and the contributions they have made for the entire month of February.  I am proud to say my home State of Illinois is rich in African-American History and I would like to share some of the great accomplishments African-American Illinoisans have made to our country. Beyond the well known Illinoisans like Miles Davis and James Cleveland who transcended racial lines in the music industry, there exist lesser-known Illinoisans who have made tremendous impacts on our society.  Take for example Dr. Mae C. Jemison, the first African-American woman in space. Raised in Chicago, Dr. Jemison graduated from Morgan Park High School in 1973. At age 16, she entered Stanford University on scholarship where she graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in chemical engineering, and fulfilled the requirements for an A.B. in African and Afro-American Studies. On September 12, 1992, Dr. Jemison flew into space aboard the space shuttle Endeavor, becoming the first woman of color to venture into space. Along with this tremendous accomplishment, Dr. Jemison has focused on improving the status, quality, and image of the scientist, specifically encouraging women and minorities to pursue careers in science. For example, she founded The Jemison Group, Inc., to research, develop, and implement advanced technologies suited to the social, political, cultural, and economic context of the individual, especially for the developing world.  Along with Dr. Jemison, there are countless others in Illinois that have had a tremendous impact on the lives of many Americans. One such example is those affiliated with the Illinois Theater Center in Chicago. In honor of Black History Month each February, the Illinois Theater Center produces an African-American play. This year is no different, with the Theater presenting a play titled ``Master Harold and the Boys''. The drama is the work of South Africa's leading playwright, and was recently chosen as ``One of the Most Significant Plays of the 20th Century'' by the National Royal Theater in London. Set in Port Elizabeth, South Africa in 1950, it depicts the coming-of-age of a white teenager and his relationship with the two black men who work as waiters at his parents' restaurant.  Dr. Jemison, and those of the Illinois Theater Center continue to carry on Dr. Woodson's goal of popularizing Black history. Black History Month allows others, like myself, to commend these remarkable individuals on their tireless efforts and accomplishments. However, while we honor the great strides made by African Americans in overcoming obstacles and color barriers, we must also look ahead and recognize the great obstacles that still hinder African Americans today.  One such obstacle is the issue of HIV/AIDS. Although African Americans make up about 12 percent of the U.S. population, they accounted for half of the new HIV cases reported in the United States in 2001. African Americans have accounted for nearly 315,000 of the more than 816,000 AIDS cases reported since the beginning of the epidemic. By the end of December 2001, more than 168,000 African Americans had died from AIDS. These astonishing statistics remind us that the issue of HIV/AIDS infiltrates all borders and is not exclusive to developing nations.  Earlier this month the Center for Disease Control and Prevention noted that the 25 States that track HIV cases reported an increase in new diagnoses. As the number of HIV cases increase, prevention programs must continue to develop in cities across the United States. One particular prevention program, the AIDS Foundation of Chicago, works to reduce the risk of HIV among African Americans living in shelters and other transitional living facilities throughout the greater Chicago area. The program trains shelter staff and volunteers to be HIV and STD prevention peer educators and provides personalized HIV counseling, testing and referral services to those at risk for HIV. Programs like these will help fight this terrible epidemic.  To fulfill the dreams of visionaries like Dr. Woodson and Dr. Jemison, progress must be made in breaking down barriers that continue to hinder African Americans. All of these great Illinoisans, and the countless others, struggled against violence and bigotry, but each managed to demonstrate through their distinctive talents that racism and bigotry are un-American. I urge all Americans to learn more about the history of African Americans in this country, and acknowledge the contributions of African Americans to our great Nation.                          ____________________
