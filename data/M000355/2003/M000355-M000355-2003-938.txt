 President, for the information of all Senators, tomorrow the Senate will be in a period of morning business until noon. Following morning business, the Senate will begin consideration of the NATO expansion treaty. Under the previous order, the Senate will debate the treaty and dispose of all amendments during tomorrow's session.  I advise my colleagues that rollcall votes are expected in relation to the two amendments to the resolution of ratification. The Senate will not vote on the adoption of the resolution of ratification until Thursday morning at 9:30.  As a reminder, cloture motions were filed on the nominations of Priscilla Owen and Miguel Estrada. This will be the second attempt to cut off a filibuster on the Owen nomination and our sixth effort with respect to Miguel Estrada. Cloture votes on Owen and Estrada will occur during Thursday's session.  In addition, I inform all Members that work continues in an effort to clear several items for floor action. These items are under discussion, including the State Department authorization bill, the bioshield bill, the air cargo security legislation, the FAA reauthorization bill, the FISA legislation, and several judicial nominations. Therefore, Members should anticipate additional votes during tomorrow's session.                          ____________________
