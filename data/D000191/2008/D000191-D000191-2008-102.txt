Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I would again congratulate the gentleman. It is sad that such a tragedy occurred to one of his constituents. But the best we can do to try to make sense of that tragedy is to try and prevent future tragedies as a result of these sorts of vehicles.  It has been fully my intention as chairman of the committee to hold hearings on both these vans and some other related safety items that have come to the attention of the committee. The reason the hearing has been delayed is because the head of the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration has been on administrative leave for personal reasons. We expect her back in the not-too-distant future, and then intend to go ahead.  But in the interim, by passing this legislation we can at least send the message that we have concern and we can try to alert the American public, we can try and avert more tragedies.  I would also point out that our colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee have substantial jurisdiction in this area. And hopefully as they cast their votes for this initiative, this resolution here today, they will think about their jurisdiction and perhaps they too will join with us in raising concerns.  With that, I have no further requests for time.
