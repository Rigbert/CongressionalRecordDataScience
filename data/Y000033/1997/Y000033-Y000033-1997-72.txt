Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment, and I reluctantly do so because I have great respect for the gentleman from California [Mr. Brown].  But my committee has held three hearings on the biosphere designations. Biosphere Reserves are unpopular because they were created without consulting, working with the public. In my State, no one was notified, including the governor. Nearby property owners, who are not even consulted about the nomination, have legitimate concerns about the program. No hearings have been held on this amendment and there has been no chance for public comment.  Very frankly, I think the amendment is, although well thought out, is not the amendment that should be adopted. For designation of Biosphere Reserves, this amendment delegates the constitutional power of the Congress to the Secretary of State. In all due respect to our new Secretary of State, I do not want this Congress to give her that much power. It only gives us a cursory role to make these decisions.  Frankly, why have more roadblocks? Nearly every month the Congress passes bills naming post offices, park visitor centers, and federal courthouses, and it is all an honorary function. If someone would like to have their area as a biosphere area now, if they want to come back, there is no reason why that Congressman in that district, the person of the people, cannot recommend it.  Again I want to stress that I think it is the role of this Congress to make these definitions, so I do oppose this amendment and urge the defeat of the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
