 President, on another point, for the last three decades, Des Moines has hosted something every year this week called the World Food Prize. As the World Food Prize kicks off this week in Des Moines, I pay tribute to an outstanding Iowan and the president of that foundation.  In his Foreign Service career, Ken Quinn was the Ambassador to Cambodia, but earlier in that career, Ken Quinn's life of service took him from a small town in Iowa to Southeast Asia and back. Decades ago, he identified an avenue to peace and prosperity. As a young Foreign Service officer, he saw that roads secured economic freedom and food security for the impoverished people of Southeast Asia.  For the last 20 years, Ambassador Quinn--now not in the Foreign Service--has cultivated the World Food Prize into the Nobel Prize for Agriculture. Thanks to his stewardship of the seeds first planted by the Nobel Peace Prize laureate of 1970, Dr. Norman Borlaug, the World Food Prize will yield humanitarian goods for generations to come.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Blackburn). The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
