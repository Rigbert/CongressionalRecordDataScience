President, I rise today to express my appreciation to the bipartisan leadership for responding so quickly to an issue that cries out for justice. With strong and responsive action from the leadership today, the U.S. Senate said that those who have a visual impairment will be able to fully utilize their talents on this Senate floor.  A resolution was accepted today in the Senate which allows persons requiring a guide dog, a wheelchair, or a cane to be considered on a case-by-case basis for entry to the floor. Pursuant to this resolution, the Sergeant at Arms has determined that for Ms. Moira Shea, a staffer in my office, that her guide dog is necessary and appropriate to the performance of her duties.
