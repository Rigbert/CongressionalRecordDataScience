 President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that on Friday, April 11, the Senate proceed, at a time determined by the majority leader, after consultation with the Democratic leader, to executive session for the consideration, for debate only, of Calendar No. 32, the nomination of Jeffrey Sutton to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit. I further ask unanimous consent that following debate on that day, the nomination be set aside and the Senate resume consideration of the nomination on Monday, April 28, for debate only. Further, I ask unanimous consent that following debate on Monday, the nomination be set aside, and on Tuesday, April 29, at a time determined by the majority leader, after consultation with the Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to a vote on the confirmation of the nomination, with no intervening action or debate.
