 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate receives the House message to accompany H.R. 1350, the IDEA reauthorization bill, if the House amends the Senate amendment, the Senate disagree with the House amendment or insist upon its amendment, as is appropriate, and request a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses; provided, alternatively, that if the House requests a conference, the Senate agree to the request for a conference, and in either case the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees with a ratio of 11 to 10.
