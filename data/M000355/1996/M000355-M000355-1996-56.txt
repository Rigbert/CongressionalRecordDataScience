 President, this committee was prepared to deal with a current trade dispute and nationalization of foreign assets in Zimbabwe, but has withdrawn action relying upon the good faith representations of Ambassador Midzi of the Republic of Zimbabwe that the problems involving United States companies have been mediated successfully. We congratulate the leadership of the Republic of Zimbabwe for its constructive actions and hope there will be no further need for this committee to review this matter nor contemplate action to remedy complaints by United States citizens.                         the export-import bank
