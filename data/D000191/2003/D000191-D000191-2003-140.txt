Speaker, well, congratulations are in order for the Bush administration. They have set yet another record, something to be proud or at least something that their political campaign contributors can be proud of, which is the trade policy of the United States which is a disaster for working Americans and the industrial infrastructure of this country, but immensely profitable for many multinational corporations based in the United States who are generous campaign contributors.  The trade deficit for the first 3 months of 2003 was a new record: $136.1 billion. If we keep that pace up, we will break last year's trade deficit of $435 billion, and reach a $550 billion trade deficit. That means we are losing $1.5 billion a day in U.S. wealth to overseas. $1 million per minute.  Mr. Speaker, 53,000 manufacturing jobs alone were lost in May of this year, hollowing out the manufacturing base of the United States of America, formally the greatest industrial Nation on Earth. There have been 251,000 lost this year and 34 consecutive months of decline in the manufacturing workforce. These are all record accomplishments of the Bush administration.  They told us if they weakened the dollar, this would all get better. Well, the dollar has plummeted, hurting the purchasing power of all Americans, yet the trade deficit is continuing to grow longer. How can that be? The economists scratch their heads. The theory says your currency goes down, your trade deficit goes. But if you do not manufacture things any more, if you do not export goods, which the United States does precious little of, then it does not matter what the value of the currency is because you are buying overseas.                              {time}  1815  In fact, if your currency goes down, your trade deficit goes up, which is exactly what happened because you are buying all the manufactured goods overseas. Besides that, the Chinese have illegally under the WTO, which I am not a supporter of, but the U.S. is a signatory to, as is China, and the U.S. fought to get them in, has fixed their currency to the U.S. currency. So no matter how low our dollar goes, we are still going to run record trade deficits with the Chinese who now are the largest holders of U.S. debt overseas.  We are not only enthralled to the Chinese for their manufacturing, they can basically threaten the United States if the United States ever decided to get tough with a lot of the bad things they do over there with the 300-plus billion dollars of our currency that they hold because of the growing trade deficit. This is a looming disaster for this country.  If we look at the record deficit we are setting domestically, again another record for the Bush administration, over a $500 billion deficit this year and the trade deficit, the United States of America is going to have to borrow over $1 trillion this year to finance a failed trade policy and a failed domestic financial policy. Borrow over $1 trillion. A lot of that money is going to come from overseas. It does not come for free, let me tell you that. A good deal of that money is going to come from what was supposed to be the Social Security lock box which has been busted open and spent and is being spent on current consumption, particularly to finance tax cuts for the wealthy.  For instance, yesterday's vote to permanently repeal any estate tax on estates over $6 million, four-tenths of 1 percent of estates in the United States of America, supposedly small family farms, small businesses and small tree and wood lot folks with over $6 million in assets. I tell you what, $6 million is plenty of an exemption for small businesses. But, no, the Bush administration had to go whole hog and go for an exemption of all estates. That will cost another $60 billion a year, which we will borrow from Social Security, from working wage-earning Americans and send to the wealthy. They will, of course, replace the Social Security benefits for those folks. Ha.  So what is the good we see in this? Unfortunately, very little. Record trade deficit, failing trade policy. What has the Bush administration proposed? Tax cuts, tax cuts, tax cuts domestically to help the deficit and then on the international front, well, our trade policy is working so well with a $550 billion looming trade deficit this year, with the loss of 53,000 manufacturing jobs in May, 250,000 lost so far this year, they want to set a new record so they want more of the same. More so-called free trade agreements. They have got two that are already on the way up here to Capitol Hill that they expect will go through like that.  The wheels are greased because these are important people and this is such a successful policy. It is working so well for whom? Not for American workers, not for our industrial infrastructure, but for a few wealthy benefactors who control those companies.  Hopefully we can bring about and restore common sense here and recognize the fact that you cannot run huge and growing deficits forever. Even Alan Greenspan has recognized that. He says this policy is not sustainable.                          ____________________
