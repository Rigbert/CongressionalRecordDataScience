Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 530) urging the appropriate representative of the United States to the 60th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights to introduce a resolution calling upon the Government of the People's Republic of China to end its human rights violations in China, and for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 530       Whereas the annual meeting of the United Nations Commission      on Human Rights in Geneva, Switzerland, is the most important      international forum for discussing human rights and      expressing international support for improved human rights      performance;       Whereas according to the Department of State, the United      States Commission on International Religious Freedom, and      international human rights organizations, the Government of      the People's Republic of China continues to commit well-     documented human rights abuses against the Chinese people;       Whereas the People's Republic of China has yet to      demonstrate its willingness to abide by internationally      accepted norms of freedom of belief, expression, and      association by repealing or amending laws and decrees that      restrict those freedoms;       Whereas the Government of People's Republic of China      continues to ban and criminalize groups it labels as cults or      heretical organizations;       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China      has repressed unregistered religious groups and spiritual      movements and persists in persecuting persons on the basis of      unauthorized religious activities using such measures as      harassment, surveillance, job discrimination, exorbitant      fines, prolonged detention, physical abuse, incarceration,      and closure or destruction of places of worship;       Whereas international human rights organizations have      documented that torture, maltreatment, the use of confessions      extracted through torture, and other abuses while in      detention are rampant in the Chinese legal system;       Whereas the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners has      been particularly harsh;       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China      launched a brutal campaign to eradicate Falun Gong from their      country;       Whereas since this time large numbers of Falun Gong      practitioners have been arrested, subjected to harsh      reeducation efforts, and some have even been tortured to      death;       Whereas Falun Gong practitioners continue to report      harassment and acts of violence at the hands of foreign      nationals which have occurred against them during peaceful      protests in the United States and other countries;       Whereas the Federal Bureau of Investigation is currently      investigating the possibility of links between attacks      against Falun Gong practitioners in the United States and the      Government of the People's Republic of China;       Whereas Catholics who remain faithful to the Pope and in      communion with Rome face continuing restrictions, including      difficulties holding worship services, obtaining building      permits for churches, and training clergy;       Whereas Protestant house church leaders are facing      increased pressure to register with the official Protestant      church or face harassment, detention, and destruction of      their places of worship;       Whereas many Catholic and Protestant leaders and believers      have been imprisoned or subject to house arrest including Su      Zhimin, a Catholic Bishop who was reportedly arrested in 1997      and who is currently reported to be in very poor health;       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China      continues to exert tight control over the religious and      cultural institutions of Tibetan Buddhists and Uighur      Muslims, using torture, arbitrary arrest, and detention      without public trial against these individuals for peacefully      expressing their religious or political views;       Whereas the whereabouts of Gendun Choekyi Nyima, the boy      identified by the Dalai Lama as the 11th Panchen Lama, are      still unknown;       Whereas Gendun Choekyi Nyima was 6 years old when the      Chinese authorities took him and his family away in 1995;       Whereas it is believed that the Chinese authorities are      holding him in a secret location;       Whereas Tibetans caught displaying photos of the 11th      Panchen Lama or the Dalai Lama face harassment, fines, and      detention;       Whereas in January 2003, the Government of the People's      Republic of China executed a     Tibetan man named Lobsang Dhondup without due process and      despite repeated assurances to United States officials that      his case and that of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche would be would      reviewed by the Chinese Supreme People's Court;       Whereas this review never happened and Tenzin Delek      Rinpoche remains on death row, in the second year of his      suspended death sentence;       Whereas enforcement by the Government of the People's      Republic of China of its one-child per family policy has been      cruel and inhumane and has included the use of forced      abortion and forced sterilization;       Whereas this one-child per family policy has led to the      abandonment and infanticide of baby girls and a      disproportionate number of male children in China, which will      have serious and detrimental sociological impacts on China      for years to come;       Whereas 14 years after the 1989 pro-democracy      demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, many protesters remain in      prison and no independent investigations have taken place      regarding the massacre that occurred during those      demonstrations;       Whereas authorities in the People's Republic of China have      continued their efforts to extinguish expressions of protest      or criticism and have detained and sentenced scores of      citizens associated with attempts to organize peaceful      protests, to expose corruption, to preserve their ethnic      minority identity, and to use the Internet for the free      exchange of ideas;       Whereas many prisoners in China are confined to state run      psychiatric hospitals for simple acts of expressing their      thoughts on political issues, like veteran human rights      activist and prisoner of conscience Wang Wanxing;       Whereas many Chinese prisoners are in Laogai, forced labor      camps in which inmates are subject to various forms of cruel      and forced labor;       Whereas the International Committee of the Red Cross and      other international human rights organizations have been      denied access to the Chinese prison system;       Whereas it well documented that organs taken from executed      prisoners are sold for use in transplants in China and      abroad;       Whereas the percentage of transplant kidneys estimated to      be derived from executed prisoners in China has been put as      high as 90 percent of all transplanted kidneys in China;       Whereas organs reported to be harvested from executed      prisoners in China include corneas, kidneys, and hearts;       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China      agreed during the December 2002 session of the United States-     China Bilateral Human Rights Dialogue to invite, without      conditions, the United States Commission on International      Religious Freedom, the United Nations Special Rapporteurs on      Religious Intolerance and Torture, and the United Nations      Working Group on Arbitrary Detention to visit China;       Whereas none of these visits have taken place in the last      year and, in the case of the United States Commission on      International Religious Freedom, two agreed upon trips were      canceled because of unacceptable conditions placed on the      visit by the Government of the People's Republic of China;       Whereas the United States decision not to introduce a      resolution calling upon the People's Republic of China to end      its human rights violations in China at the 59th Session of      United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva was      based, in part, on the belief that the aforementioned      agreements signaled a good faith commitment on the part of      Chinese officials to improve human rights practice in China;       Whereas when well-founded, balanced, and accurate      resolutions regarding human rights in China were raised in      previous sessions of the United Nations Commission on Human      Rights, the Government of the People's Republic of China      strongly pressured other countries to oppose the      consideration of those resolutions;       Whereas since the last session of the United States China      Bilateral Human Rights Dialogue, a number of very troubling      incidents have occurred, including--       (1) the arrests of a number of democracy advocates,       (2) the detention and torture of 18 Tibetans who were      forcibly repatriated from Nepal with the cooperation of      Chinese officials, in contravention of international law,       (3) the ongoing forced repatriation of North Korean      nationals, who upon return to North Korea will face almost      certain arrest, torture, or even death,       (4) the arrest and sentencing of Internet essayists and      labor protesters,       (5) the execution of Lobsang Dondrup and continued      detention of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche, and       (6) the continued refusal to allow access by United States      diplomats and family members of the accused to the trials of      those detained for political or religious activities;       Whereas the People's Republic of China has signed the      International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but has      yet to take the necessary steps to make the treaty legally      binding;       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China is      a party to the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to      Refugees and its 1967 Protocol;       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China is      a party to the United Nations Convention Against Torture and      Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or      Punishment; and       Whereas the Constitution and laws of the People's Republic      of China purport to provide for fundamental human rights,      however, the protections of these rights are often ignored in      practice: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That--       (1) it is the sense of Congress that--       (A) the United States Government should continue to insist      that the People's Republic of China adhere to fundamental      human rights principles and allow its citizens the full      enjoyment of those rights;       (B) at the 60th Session of the United Nations Human Rights      Commission in Geneva, Switzerland, the appropriate      representative of the United States should introduce a      resolution calling upon the People's Republic of China to end      its human rights violations in China and meet internationally      recognized standards for human rights;       (C) the United States Government should take the lead in      organizing multilateral support to obtain passage by the      Commission of such a resolution and should draft the      resolution in such a way as to highlight specific human      rights abuses;       (D) all countries with representatives at the 60th Session      of the United Nations Human Rights Commission should support      passage of such a resolution and resist efforts by      representatives of the People's Republic of China to oppose      the consideration or passage of such a resolution; and       (E) United States Government officials and officials from      other governments should continue to speak out in      international forums and elsewhere against Chinese repression      of religious and political freedom, persecution of Tibetans,      Falun Gong practitioners, Catholics, Protestants, and Uighur      Muslims, the unjust arrest and detention of religious leaders      and political dissidents, harsh conditions in Laogai and      other prisons, coercive family planning policies, and the      forced return of North Korean refugees; and       (2) Congress urges the Government of the People's Republic      of China--       (A) to take the necessary measures to stop the persecution      of all religious practitioners and to safeguard fundamental      human rights;       (B) to stop the forced return of North Korean refugees, to      allow the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees      access to North Koreans inside China, and to work with the      United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to develop a      viable solution to the humanitarian crisis involving North      Korean refugees;       (C) to end its coercive one-child per family policy and      ensure that no national, provincial, or local government      officials subject women to forced abortions or      sterilizations;       (D) to immediately hold an open and transparent      investigation into the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy      demonstrators in Tiananmen Square, to release all the      prisoners held in connection with that event, and to pay      compensation to the families who lost their loved ones;       (E) to release from detention all prisoners of conscience,      persons held because of their religious activities, and      persons of humanitarian concern;       (F) to release the 11th Panchen Lama identified by Dalai      Lama and allow him to undertake his rightful role;       (G) to allow the Chinese people to practice freely and      openly their religious beliefs;       (H) to adhere to the provisions and guidelines of the      International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the      United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Forms of      Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and the      1951 Convention Relating to Refugees and its 1967 Protocol;      and       (I) to allow, immediately and without restrictions, visits      to China by the United States Commission on International      Religious Freedom, the United Nations Special Rapporteurs on      Religious Intolerance and Torture, the United Nations Working      Group on Arbitrary Detention, and the International Committee      of the Red Cross.
