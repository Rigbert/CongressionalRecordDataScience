 Chad Padgett first came to work in my office in 1994 and has served as my State Director for more than a decade. Madam Speaker, to put the magnitude and demands of his job into perspective requires some explanation. There are only seven other states in the U.S. House of Representatives that have State Directors. In the other 43 states, the position is commonly referred to as District Director. For example, the State of California has 53 House District Directors.  During Mr. Padgett's tenure in my office he has traveled to almost every city, town, village and road stop in the state. That's quite an accomplishment in and of itself, when you think about how large the 49th state actually is. Alaska has 6640 miles of coastline representing 50 percent of our nation's total coastline and is one-fifth the size of the entire country. Many of the places Mr. Padgett has traveled to have only been accessible by air or water. Remember, even our state capitol, the third largest city in the state, can only be accessed by plane or ferry. He has traveled by car, truck, jet, single-engine plane, helicopter, state ferry, and boats of all sizes and makes.  Madam Speaker, Mr. Padgett has had a lot of geography to cover in Alaska--more than California, Texas and Montana combined. These three states have 90 people doing what Mr. Padgett does.  As mentioned earlier, Mr. Padgett joined my team in 1994 as a Campaign Assistant. In 1995, he became a Special Assistant in my congressional office and quickly became my Deputy State Director. He remained in that position until, under President George W. Bush's administration, he received a Presidential nomination to serve as State Director for the Farm Services Agency. From there, he became the State Director for USDA Rural Development. He remained with the USDA until 2009, when he chose to come back to work as my State Director.  As much as I hate to see Mr. Padgett leave my office, I am equally pleased that he has been selected to serve as the State Director for the Bureau of Land Management in Alaska.  Mr. Padgett will excel in his new position. He brings to the job the right temperament, integrity, experience and knowledge necessary to provide leadership and stewardship overseeing our federal lands.  Mr. Padgett has proven himself as a loyal, competent and respected public servant. He has shown care and compassion for literally thousands of Alaskans by helping them resolve their problems and navigate the bureaucratic mazes.  He is well-liked by his co-workers and has helped mentor many young staffers by instilling his core values of hard work, loyalty, responsibility and maintaining a positive attitude.  To me, Chad Padgett is more than my State Director. Most of all, he is a trusted friend. He is an advisor with my best interests always at heart. He is like family--and always will be.  While it is difficult thinking of his departure from my staff, it gives me a great sense of pride and comfort knowing he will oversee and be the steward for about a quarter-of-a-billion acres of federal land in Alaska.  On behalf of the countless number of Alaskans that he has helped, his co-workers, and most of all, my family and me--I thank him and God bless.  We are excited and extend our best wishes to him for the challenges ahead.                          ____________________
