 In August 1988, he launched his final offensive against dozens of other villages, killing hundreds, and causing tens of thousands to flee to neighboring countries. A staff report prepared for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, based on interviews with survivors, described the atrocities in vivid detail:       The bombs . . . did not produce a large explosion. Only a      weak sound could be heard and then a yellowish cloud spread      out from the center of the explosion. . . . Those who were      very close to the bombs died almost instantly. Those who did      not die instantly found it difficult to breathe and began to      vomit. The gas stung the eyes, skin and lungs of the      villagers exposed to it. Many suffered temporary blindness.       After the bombs exploded, many villagers ran and submerged      themselves in nearby streams to escape the spreading gas. . .      . Many of those who made it to streams survived. Those who      could not run from the growing smell, mostly the very old and      the very young, died. The survivors who saw the dead reported      that blood could be seen trickling out of the mouths of some      of the bodies. A yellowish fluid could also be seen oozing      out of the noses and mouths of some of the dead. Some said      the bodies appeared frozen. Many of the dead bodies turned      blackish blue.  Saddam's outrageous act prompted only a muted response from the world community. One of the few sounds of protest came from this body, where Senators Pell and Helms promptly introduced legislation to impose sanctions against Iraq.  The bill sailed through the Senate on a voice vote, a day after it was introduced. Unfortunately, the Reagan Administration, still under the delusion that it could deal with Saddam, denounced the bill as ``premature,'' and later succeeded in blocking its enactment in the final days of the One Hundredth Congress.  The Kurds are not the only victims of Saddam's atrocities. The ``Marsh Arabs'' of Southern Iraq have seen hundreds of their villages destroyed. They have been subjected to arbitrary killings and forcibly relocated. The mainstay of their ancient culture--the marshes of Southern Iraq--have been drained so that military operations can be carried out against them and other rebels with greater ease.  In addition to terrorizing his own citizens, Saddam Hussein has unleashed his wrath against Iraq's neighbors on numerous occasions. He used chemical weapons repeatedly during the Iran-Iraq War in clear violation of the 1925 Geneva Convention. His troops raped and murdered with impunity during the occupation of Kuwait. And he has rained scud missiles on the civilian populations of Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Israel.  It is high time that the international community stop looking the other way when presented with these blatant crimes against humanity. It is time to systematically compile the evidence of Saddam Hussein's atrocities and undertake criminal proceedings to deliver the punishment that he so richly deserves.  Our action in passing this resolution presents a challenge to the international community to join the United States in putting the wheels of justice into motion.  We should not underestimate the difficulty of physically delivering Saddam Hussein to a tribunal, but it would be unconscionable to abandon the quest for justice. Silence and inaction would be a grave injustice to the hundreds upon thousands of his victims.               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 11, 1998]                         Why I Went, What I Saw                         (By Christine Gosden)       We have all talked so long and so reflexively about      ``weapons of mass destruction'' that the phrase has lost much      of its immediacy and meaning. It has become, like ``nuclear      devastation'' and ``chemical and biological warfare,'' an      abstract term of governmental memos, punditry and political      debate. For many it calls forth neither visual imagery nor      visceral revulsion.       Two Sundays ago, the TV program ``60 Minutes'' got a good      start on changing that when it broadcast the story of the      Iraqi city of Halabja 10 years after its civilian population      had been the target of a chemical attack by Saddam Hussein.      That population is mainly Kurdish and had sympathized with      Iran during the Iran-Iraq war. The gassing of its people was      in retaliation for that sympathizing.       ``60 Minutes'' has given us permission to make still      pictures from the film, which was originally shot, both in      1988 and 1998, by the British film maker, Gwynne Roberts. The      ``60 Minutes'' staff also helped us to get in touch with the      remarkable Dr. Christine Gosden, a British medical      specialist, whose efforts to help the people of Halabja is      documented. Dr. Gosden, who went out to Halabja 10 years      after the bombing, agreed to write a piece for us, expanding      on what she saw in Iraq. People around the world have seen      the evidence of deformity and mutation following from the      nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It shaped their      attitude toward the use of atomic weapons. Maybe if more      evidence of the unimaginable, real-life effects of chemical      warfare becomes available, a comparable attitude toward those      weapons will develop.       On the 16th of March 1988, an Iraqi military strike      subjected Halabja, a Kurdish town of 45,000 in northern Iraq,      to bombardment with the greatest attack of chemical weapons      ever used against a civilian population. The chemical agents      used were a ``cocktail'' of mustard gas (which affects skin,      eyes and the membranes of the nose, throat and lungs), and      the nerve agents sarin, tabun and VX. The chemicals to which      the people were exposed drenched their skin and clothes,      affected their respiratory tracts and eyes and contaminated      their water and food.       Many people simply fell dead where they were, immediate      casualties of the attack estimates put these deaths at about      5,000. A few were given brief and immediate treatment, which      involved taking them to the United States, Europe and Iran.      The majority of them returned to Halabja. Since then, no      medical team, either from Iraq, Europe or America or from any      international agency has monitored either the short- or long-     term consequences of this chemical attack. Gwynne Roberts, a      film director, made the award-winning film ``The Winds of      Death'' about the attack in 1988. I saw this film, and it had      a tremendous effect on me. Gwynne revisited Halabja in 1997      and was concerned that many of the survivors seemed very ill.      He could not understand why no one had tried to find out what      was happening to them. He convinced me that this was      something I had to do.       Why would a female professor of medical genetics want to      make a trip like this? I went to learn and to help. This was      the first time that a terrible mixture of chemical weapons      had been used against a large civilian population. I wanted      to see the nature and scale of the problems these people      faced, and was concerned that in the 10 years since the      attack no one, including the major aid agencies, had visited      Halabja to determine exactly what the effects of these      weapons had been.       My medical specialty was particularly apt. My principal      field of research is directed toward trying to understand the      major causes of human congenital malformations, infertility      and cancers including breast, ovarian, prostate and colon      cancers. I am carrying out studies on a group of about 15      genes called tumor suppressor genes, which include breast/     ovarian cancer genes BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 colon cancer genes and      the Retinoblastoma and Wilm's tumor genes associated with      childhood cancers. When these genes are disrupted or mutate,      they have a number of effects. Alterations lead to congenital      abnormalities or pregnancy loss. Their role after birth is to      try to prevent cancers from forming. Later in life, loss or      mutation may lead to infertility and cancers.       I was particularly concerned about the effects on the women      and children. Most of the previous reported exposures to      chemical weapons and mustard gas had involved men involved in      military service; chemical weapons had never been used on      this scale on a civilian population before. I was worried      about possible effects on congenital malformations, fertility      and cancers, not just in women and children but in the whole      population. I also feared that there might be other major      long-term effects, such as blindness and neurological damage,      for which there is no known treatment.       What I found was far worse than anything I had suspected,      devastating problems occurring 10 years after the attack.      These chemicals seriously affected people's eyes and      respiratory and neurological systems. Many became blind. Skin      disorders which involve severe scarring are frequent, and      many progress to skin cancer. Working in conjunction with the      doctors in the area, I compared the frequency of these      conditions such as infertility, congenital malformations and      cancers (including skin, head, neck, respiratory system,      gastrointestinal tract, breast and childhood cancers) in      those who were in Halabja at the time with an unexposed      population from a city in the same region. We found the      frequencies in Halabja are at least three to four times      greater, even 10 years after the attack. An increasing number      of children are dying each year of leukemias and lymphomas.      The cancers tend to occur in much younger people in Halabja      than elsewhere, and many people have aggressive tumors, so      that mortality rates are high. No chemotherapy or      radiotherapy is available in this region.       I found that there was also a total lack of access to      pediatric surgery to repair the major heart defects, hare lip      and cleft palate or other major malformations in the      children. This meant that children in Halabja are dying of      heart failure when children with the same heart defects could      have had surgery and would probably have survived in Britain      or the United States. It was agonizing for me to see      beautiful children whose faces were disfigured by hare lip      and cleft palate when I know that skilled and gifted surgeons      correct these defects every day in North America and Europe.       The neuropsychiatric consequences are seen as human tragedy      on every street, in almost every house and every ward of the      hospital. People weep and are in great distress because of      their severe depression, and suicidal tendencies are      alarmingly evident. The surgeons often have to remove bullets      from people who have failed in their suicide attempts. In      collecting data from the Martyrs Hospital in Halabja, the      doctors said that they are not able to see patients with      psychiatric and neurological conditions because there is a      lack of resources and there is no effective treatment. Many      people have neurological impairment or long-term      neuromuscular effects. Most people cannot afford even the      cheapest treatment or drugs and so are reluctant to come to      the hospital. At present, even for those with life-     threatening conditions, there is no effective therapy for any      of these conditions in Halabja.       On the first day of my visit to the labor and gynecological      ward in the hospital, there were no women in normal labor and      no one had recently delivered a normal baby. Three women had      just miscarried. The staff in the labor ward told of the very      large proportion of pregnancies in which there were major      malformations. In addition to fetal losses and perinatal      deaths, there is also a very large number of infant deaths.      The frequencies of these in the Halabjan women is more than      four times greater than that in the neighboring city of      Soulemaneya. The findings of serious congenital malformations      with genetic causes occurring in children born years after      the chemical attack suggest that the effects from these      chemical warfare agents are transmitted to succeeding      generations.       Miscarriage, infant deaths and infertility mean that life      isn't being replenished in this community, as one would      expect if these weapons had no long-term effects. The people      hoped that after the attack they could rebuild the families      and communities that had been destroyed. The inability to do      so has led to increasing despair. Their lives and hopes have      been shattered. One survivor described being in a cellar with      about a hundred other people, all of whom died during the      attack. Not only do those who survived have to cope with      memories of their relatives suddenly dying in their arms,      they have to try to come to terms with their own painful      diseases and those of their surviving friends and relatives.       For instance, many people have more than one major      condition, including respiratory problems, eye conditions,      neurological disorders, skin problems, cancers and children      with congenital malformations and childhood handicaps such as      mental handicap, cerebral palsy and Down's syndrome. The      occurrences of genetic mutations and carcinogenesis in this      population appear comparable with those who were one to two      kilometers from the hypocenter of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki      atomic bombs and show that the chemicals used in this attack,      particularly mustard gas, have a general effect on the body      similar to that of ionizing radiation.       Ten years after the attack, people are suffering a wide      spectrum of effects, all of which are attributable to long-     term damage to DNA. A radio broadcast was made the day before      our arrival to ask people who were ill to come to the      hospital to record their problems. On the first day, 700      people came; 495 of them had two or more major problems. The      cases we encountered were extremely sad.       The people of Halabja need immediate help. There is a need      for specialists (such as pediatric surgeons), equipment and      drugs. Even more basic than this, though, is the need for      heat, clean water and careful efforts to safeguard them      against further attacks. We have to realize that there is      very little medical or scientific knowledge about how to      treat the victims of a chemical weapons attack like this      effectively. We need to listen, think and evaluate with      skill, since many of these people have had exposures to      strange combinations of toxic gases. They have conditions      that have not been seen or reported before. We may severely      disadvantage a large group of vulnerable people and deny them      effective diagnosis and treatment if we are intellectually      arrogant and fail to admit that we have virtually no      knowledge about how to treat the problems resulting from      these terrible weapons, which have been used to more powerful      and inhumane effect than ever before.       The pictures beamed around the world after the attack in      1988 in newspapers and on TV were horrifying. One picture was      of a father who died trying to shield his twin sons from the      attack. The statue in the road at the entrance to Halabja is      based on that picture. This is not a traditional statue of      someone standing proud and erect, captured in stone or bronze      to represent man triumphant and successful, but of a man      prostrate and agonized dying in the act of trying to protect      his children. A deep and lasting chill went through me when I      entered the town and saw the statue, and it settled like a      toxic psychological cloud over me. This proved hard to      dispel; it intensified as I met the people, heard their      stories and saw the extent of the long-term illnesses caused      by the attack. The terrible images of the people of Halabja      and their situation persist and recur in my nightmares and      disturb my waking thoughts. Perhaps these thoughts persist so      vividly as a reminder to me that the major task is now to try      and get help for these people.
