 President, I am proud to be here again this year, joining my colleagues in the Senate to talk about the National Race for the Cure. This important event underscores the critical need to raise awareness about breast cancer, and the need to support research and education about this frightening disease.  We have heard the numbers and seen the statistics. Each year breast cancer strikes 184,000 women, and kills an estimated 45,000. Far too many have died from this disease, and the list includes many of my own friends and relatives. We all can agree that more must be done to educate women about the risks, prevention, and treatment of breast cancer. I can tell you that, as a woman, the mixed messages we receive are frustrating and dangerous.  We hear conflicting advice about when to have a mammogram--one year it's at age 40 then next it's at age 50--we need consistent, accurate information or else women will continue to die. Studies show that early detection and proper treatment could save the lives of 9 out of 10 women with breast cancer--that's 90 percent, Mr. President. These numbers are too serious to ignore.  We must do all we can to encourage education and awareness about how we can protect ourselves and our daughters from the tragedy of breast cancer. For this reason, the Race for the Cure is so very important; the D.C. race isthe largest 5-kilometer race in the country--35,000 participants are expected to run, walk, and roller blade this year. This is a day to draw national attention to this disease; throughout the year races will be taking place in cities across the country to turn the spotlight on this critical women's health issue. Of course 1 day is not enough, but it's a good place to start and it's an important reminder for all of us.  I want to encourage my colleagues to participate, as well as people all over the country. As it happens, today and tomorrow are Capitol Hill registration days. I am proud to say my office has put together a team and will be participating in the race. I urge everyone to do the same.  Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to thank Senator Bradley for his passionate and personal commitment to addressing women's health issues. I appreciate his leadership and dedication to supporting the National Race for the Cure.  I also want to briefly thank Senator Ford for submitting the resolution to designate June 15 ``National Race for the Cure Day.'' I am proud to join him as a cosponsor of this resolution and for recognizing the importance of the Race for the Cure in the battle against breast cancer.  Breast cancer, while predominantly a woman's health issue, does affect men and it certainly can devastate an entire family. We must do all that we can to protect ourselves and our families from having to endure the tragedy of this disease. The National Race for the Cure is an ideal way to join the fight against breast cancer. I thank my colleagues for recognizing that.           No Backsliding on Finding a Cure for Breast Cancer
