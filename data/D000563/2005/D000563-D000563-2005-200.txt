President, this amendment provides a fully offset tax credit to the very best companies in America. We call them patriotic employers. They are employers who invest in creating jobs in the United States, not overseas. They are employers who pay a decent wage, at least $7.75 an hour. They are employers who provide a retirement plan, either defined benefit or defined contribution, matching at least 5 percent of workers' contributions. They are employers who pay health insurance, up to 60 percent of the workers' health care premiums. And they are employers who make up the difference when their employees, who are in the Guard and Reserve, go off to serve their country.  These are the very best employers in America. We should reward them with a 1-percent tax credit, fully offset. Stand up for the best employers in America. Support this amendment.
