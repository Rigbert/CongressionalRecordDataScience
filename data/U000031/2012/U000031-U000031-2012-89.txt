Chairman, I yield myself such time as I might consume.  I rise today in support of the PATH Act, which addresses two of the most glaring deficiencies in the President's overhaul of the health care system.  By what it does and also by what it fails to do, the health care law threatens access to quality health care for literally millions of Americans.  Section 3403 of the Affordable Care Act established the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB. A panel of 15 unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats will be given the power to make major decisions regarding what goods and services are valuable. These decisions will then be fast-tracked, essentially bypassing the legislative process, with almost no opportunity for discussion or review. The PATH Act prevents this by repealing IPAB.  I suspect that most Americans still believe that patients and their doctors should have a voice and should be able to decide what health care services that they find valuable. I think that they still believe that major policy decisions affecting the Medicare program and the health care system in general need to go through the regular legislative process and be subject to the normal system of checks and balances according to the Constitution.  It is encouraging that the cosponsors of legislation to repeal IPAB include 20 Democrats and that the bill was favorably reported out of the Energy and Commerce Committee earlier this month without any recorded opposition--a voice vote.  I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support repealing IPAB and not to block its passage at the expense of our seniors in a blind effort to defend the President's signature legislation.  The legislation today also includes reforms that will actually lower thecost of health care, a glaring omission in the President's health care law. The health care law failed to provide any meaningful reform to the broken and costly medical liability system, which is currently one of the largest cost drivers of our health care system.  The current system is responsible for as much as $200 billion a year in unnecessary spending on defensive medicine. It fails to compensate injured patients in a fair and timely matter, and it threatens access to quality health care by driving good doctors out of high-risk specialties such as obstetrics and neurosurgery.                              {time}  1510  According to the CBO, these commonsense reforms will reduce the Federal deficit by $48.6 billion over the next 10 years.  How have opponents proposed to fix this present system? They want to spend more; $50 million in grants for State demonstrations, as called for in the health care law, is not a solution. It's an abdication of responsibility. The President promised to look at Republican ideas for medical liability reform. Passing this legislation is the very first step towards allowing the President to make good on that promise.  Health care decisions should be made between a doctor and a patient. That relationship doesn't work when bureaucrats and trial lawyers come between them. So I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this legislation.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
