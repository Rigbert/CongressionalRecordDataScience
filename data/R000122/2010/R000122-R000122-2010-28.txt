President, today I recognize and congratulate EUHOFA, an international association of hotel and hospitality schools, on the occasion of its 49th Congress, which was held in Providence, RI, from November 7 through November 12, 2010.  EUHOFA International was founded in Europe in 1955 with the mission of enhancing the quality of the training for the tourism industry throughout the world. Its members represent the world's top hotel and hospitality colleges and universities in 45 countries. Representatives from 19 of these countries attended this year's congress in Providence.  The 2010 EUHOFA Congress marks only the second time this event has taken place in the United States. This year, as in 1994, the EUHOFA Congress was hosted by Johnson & Wales University in Providence, which is home to one of our Nation's premier hospitality schools.  The tourism industry is a vital part of my State and our Nation's economy. Many people associate tourism solely with vacations. But at its heart, tourism provides an important bridge between countries and cultures, and at a time of great change, this kind of understanding is essential for our national security and economic recovery.  I am very proud that Rhode Island and Johnson & Wales University are hosting this great event. On behalf of the U.S. Senate, it is my pleasure to congratulate the 49th EUHOFA International World Congress.                          ____________________
