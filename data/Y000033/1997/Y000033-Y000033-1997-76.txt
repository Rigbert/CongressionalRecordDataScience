Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to report that the U.S. Man and Biosphere program is funding a meeting of those concerned with the restoration of the Florida Everglades through a grant. The meeting is at a resort in Maine. Why is it not being held in Florida near the Everglades, the subject of the meeting?  Local participation would be encouraged, and the meeting would cost the taxpayers less. But I really think this shows how badly this program is being managed. It is not being managed, it has not been managed, it is a boondoggle, it has been a boondoggle, and it circumvents the role of Congress.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from California [Mr. Farr].
