In true patriotic fashion, on the day of our great Nation's celebration of independence, a naturalization ceremony will take place, welcoming new citizens of the United States of America. This memorable occasion, coordinated by the Hammond Public Library and presided over by Magistrate Judge Andrew Rodovich, will be held at Harrison Park in Hammond, Indiana.  America is a country founded by immigrants. From its beginning, settlers have come from countries around the globe to the United States in search of better lives for themselves and their families. The upcoming oath ceremony will be a shining example of what is so great about the United States of America--that people from all over the world can cometogether and unite as members of a free, democratic Nation. These individuals realize the great things America has to offer. They realize that there is nowhere else in the world that offers a better opportunity for success and a good life than here in America.  On July 4, 2007, the following individuals, representing many countries throughout the world, will take their oath of citizenship in Hammond, Indiana: Daniela Gomez Alba, Vanhvilay Thongsawath, Fayez Ghaly Samaan, Sean David Sternfeldt, Maria Del Carmen Garcia, Khaled Abdullah Mohamed Alkadhi, Jovica Georgiev, Evica Jankovic, Khadija Nasreen, Muhammad Munawar Uddin, Ljubica Andonova, Yasser Yousof Hussein Alsalahi, Reina Ahmad Elabed, Heidemarie Nealon, Nidal Khaleel Bader, Rosa Navarro, Irma Guadalupe Gallegos, Victor Manuel Salas, Hildeberta Ignacio, Ivan Ignacio Esquival, Edgar Ignacio, Maria Gonzalez, Vassilka Ivanova Sokolova, Jose Ernesto Munoz Munoz, Margarita Lomeli, Rosalia Aguilar De Hernandez, Ramona Garcia, Hector Miguel Rivera Gallegos, Rafael Negrete Gentil, Stan Krzysztofiak, Juan Carlos Bustos, Angelina Rico De Becerra, Maria Teresa Paredes De Sanchez, Thomas William Fridel, Mirko Koceski, Zivka Koceski, Phuoc Hong Tran, Ramachandra Mukkamala, Cristina Chavez Melesio, Maureen Allyson Fridel, Omar Mehidi, Priya Venkata Vishnu Mukkamala, Kameswari Kalluri, Carlos Alberto Garcia Morales, Sonja Sabo-Djuric, Maria De Jesus Galvan Briseno, Paul Derek MacGregor, Layda Eunice Salazar, Mary Ortiz, and Nancy Takla.  Though each individual has sought to become a citizen of the United States for his or her own reasons, be it for education, occupation, or to offer their loved ones better lives, each is inspired by the fact that the United States of America is, as Abraham Lincoln described it, a country ``. . . of the people, by the people, and for the people.'' They realize that the United States is truly a free Nation. By seeking American citizenship, they have made the decision that they want to live in a place where, as guaranteed by the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights, they can practice religion as they choose, speak their minds without fear of punishment, and assemble in peaceful protest should they choose to do so.  Madam Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating these individuals, who will become citizens of the United States of America on July 4, 2007, the day of our Nation's independence. They, too, will be American citizens, and they, too, will be guaranteed the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We, as a free and democratic society, congratulate them and welcome them.                          ____________________
