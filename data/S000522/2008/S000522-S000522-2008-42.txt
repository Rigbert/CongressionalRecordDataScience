Madam Speaker, I would like to again thank my good friend and colleague, Mr. Payne, for his sponsorship of this resolution. I think it sends a clear message to Zimbabwe and to Mugabe himself and to all of the enablers that have not done their fair part in trying to mitigate and hopefully end this crisis.  And I want to thank Mr. Royce for his very eloquent statement made just a moment ago and for his leadership as well.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
