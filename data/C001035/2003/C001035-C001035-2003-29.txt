I would also like to assure him that I do not believe the Governmental Affairs Committee's jurisdiction affects in any way the Judiciary Committee's jurisdiction over immigration and naturalization matters, as set forth in Senate Rule XXV. The Governmental Affairs Committee was responsible for the Homeland Security Act of 2002 which created the new Department of Homeland Security. The committee has conducted wide-ranging and vigorous oversight of the Department and, this year alone, has reported out six bills that address homeland security concerns. In total, the Governmental Affairs Committee has held over 30 hearings on homeland security matters, thus reflecting the paramount role it plays with respect to these matters.  The committee also has handled the nominations of almost all of the Department's nominees. On June 5 of this year, our committee held a hearing on Mr. Garcia's nomination. We reported his nomination to the full Senate on June 17. We then agreed to a referral of Mr. Garcia's nomination to the Judiciary Committee. I understand that my colleague, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, now seeks a second referral of the nomination in order to complete its work thereon. I have no objection to my colleagues' request.
