The observation of September as National Hispanic Heritage Month began in 1968 with the designation of Hispanic Heritage Week. It was expanded by President Ronald Reagan in 1988 to cover a 30-day period. Now, every year from September 15 to October 15, we proudly celebrate the histories, cultures and contributions of Americans whoseancestry includes Spain, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central and South America.  The founding of the United States of America was predicated on the idea that all men are created equal and that America would be a place where anyone could achieve and succeed. That success should know no boundaries.  This year's theme for National Hispanic Heritage Month recognizes the role Hispanic Americans have played in making that dream a reality. Their strength and hard work, anchored by a deep love for family and country, has helped shape our society for the better.  I commend the proud history of all Hispanic Americans and ask that all Americans honor National Hispanic Heritage Month. The richness of Hispanic culture and the contributions of Hispanic Americans have made our country a better nation.                          ____________________
