The amendment that will be offered in its appropriate turn by Senator Conrad will address the critical issue of helping families make ends meet by helping them with their energy costs, both in severe winters and scalding summers.  However, we have to do much more than this. We have to help people with mortgage bills, the rising cost of food and energy and stagnant wages. I hope the administration and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will join us in the coming months to enact legislation that will make a huge difference for Americans in all phases of the economic issues that challenge them--paying the mortgage, feeding the family, heating their home, paying the health care bills, getting jobs in the United States that pay wages with which they can support their families. We could do that. We have done it in the past. There is no reason we cannot work together to make it happen now.  I yield the floor.
