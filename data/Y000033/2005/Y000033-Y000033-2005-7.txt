Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill.  As this body's only licensed mariner, I understand the lengths to which our Nation's mariners and vessel owners go, to obtain or renew their required licenses and documents.  This bill will allow merchant mariners and vessel owners in the gulf region to continue normal operations under existing merchant mariner documents, licenses and certificates of vessel inspection.  The bill will also allow the Coast Guard to continue its recovery of documents that were damaged by flood waters at the Regional Examination Center in New Orleans necessary to issue renewed licenses and documents in the future.  The Coast Guard has done a remarkable job to restore most services in the gulf region despite suffering significant damage to Coast Guard facilities.  However, as a result of coastguardsmen's tireless effort to protect the safety and security of our coasts many servicemen were called to duty when otherwise they would have been on leave.  This bill assures that any member of the Coast Guard that was involved in the response efforts along the gulf coast will retain accumulated leave up to 90 days that would otherwise be lost.  Lastly, this bill commends the men and women of the Coast Guard for their heroic and selfless service in response to hurricanes Katrina and Rita this year.  I urge all members to join me in supporting the Coast Guard and the Merchant Mariner community for their continued efforts to restore normal and safe operations along our gulf coast.  Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
