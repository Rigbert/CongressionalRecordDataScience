 Chairman, I offer this amendment along with my colleagues, the gentleman from California [Mr. Waxman], the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. Vento], and the gentleman from California [Mr. Farr].  This amendment simply provides for full and unbiased information. It provides that the CBO include an estimate of long- and short-term health care and environmental cost savings and other benefits of unfunded mandates.  The bottom line is the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act threatens to dismantle many laws that protect the public health and the environment. This is because State and local governments need to heed these laws just like the private sector.  When we consider the merits of mandates like the Safe Drinking Water Act, OSHA, and bills regulating the disposal of medical waste, we should be aware of the costs imposed on local governments. That is absolutely appropriate. But we should also be equally aware of the cost savings, the cost savings expected from these mandates.  The true cost of a bill is the direct cost imposed minus the cost savings. This amendment ensures that the CBO estimate the true cost.  If this amendment is adopted, we will be less likely to discard preventative legislation that is cost effective in the long run.  Prevention is much cheaper than a cure. But prevention has a short-term direct cost. If this amendment is not adopted, we will only be informed of that short-term direct cost and will not be told about the expected cost savings.  Cost savings is not a small part of the equation. H.R. 5 threatens astronomical health care costs at a time when we want to save money. Today one in three of us will get cancer and, frankly, one in four of us will die of it. Over 60 different occupations are at a documented risk of cancer, including farmers, petrochemical workers, asbestos workers, plastics manufacturers, and radiation workers.  Under H.R. 5 it will be much harder to respond to this expensive and debilitating health care crisis and easier for shortsighted private industries to ignore it. We need access to real costs, including the long-term medical costs that will result if we fail to respond.                              {time}  1200  Lung cancer is the No. 1 cancer killer in America, yet H.R. 5 will hamstring us from imposing indoor air laws limiting tobacco smoke in workplaces and public places. The cost of imposing no-smoking areas is minuscule--minuscule in comparison to the cost of treating lung cancer. This amendment would clearly show the cost difference.  H.R. 5 also threatens, in my view, unacceptable environmental contamination and extremely expensive cleanup costs. Superfund sites littering the Nation are left festering because they are so expensive to clean up. It would have been more cost effective to prevent that contamination in the first place. We cannot foresee all future environmental problems. That is one reason we cannot say that current laws do an adequate job protecting us, but the CBO estimate of environmental cost savings will help us identify those cost-effective bills.  Fortunately, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act does not apply to ``emergency legislation,'' but how will we know when there is a health care or an environmental emergency? The best way is to adopt this amendment which would indicate when the savings strongly outweigh the short-term direct costs and a crisis is at hand.  This amendment also requires a CBO analysis of the benefits of the legislation. As I mentioned earlier, H.R. 5 could very well destroy our environmental and public safety laws. These laws not only save money, but they prevent needless deaths, pain, suffering and environmental degradation. These benefits should not be ignored.  This amendment provides for a CBO estimate of the benefits to human health, welfare, the environment, and the economy. Costs should not be viewed in a vacuum. Intelligent decisions require a cost-benefit analysis. If CBO provides information on costs, which is absolutely appropriate, and benefits, we would have access to a consistent and an unbiased cost-benefit analysis.
