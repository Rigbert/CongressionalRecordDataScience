 I strongly support passage of S. 1798, which is included in this omnibus measure, because so many companies in California and across the nation depend on a strong and well-functioning patent system.  While S. 1798 will provide important protection for inventors and innovators and help reduce needless patent litigation, I do have some concerns regarding the compromise reached regarding the reexamination procedure set forth in Title VI. As I understand it, this section will reduce the burden of patent cases in our federal courts. However, we need to be sure that the procedure fully and fairly protects the rights of all parties, and some concerns about this process have been brought to my attention over the last few weeks.  Out of deference to the Chairman and the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, and being sensitive to the compromise that the House reached, I did not seek amendments to this title of the bill. Furthermore, I feel strongly that the bill should move forward without further delay, so I support its final passage. This does not mean, however, that I believe we should cease to be concerned about how the new system will function. Accordingly, I would like to receive assurances from Chairman Hatch that we will keep a close eye on how well this new reexamination system works. In particular, I would like to request that the Committee obtain an interim report from the Patent and Trademark Office under the authority specified in section 606 of S. 1798 not later than 18 months after this bill becomes effective. I would also invite Chairman Hatch to hold a hearing to consider this information, and to obtain views from people who both supported and opposed this compromise system.
