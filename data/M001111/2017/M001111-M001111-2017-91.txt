 President, I want Senate Republicans who are about to take this vote--and Vice President Pence--to be very clear on what they are about to do. As a direct result of their choices today, extreme politicians in States across the country will have greater power to take away women's choices.  I think it speaks volumes that the vote to uphold this rule--which simply says family planning centers, where women can exercise their constitutionally protected rights, should not bediscriminated against--is bipartisan. But do you know what I think is most striking about this vote?
