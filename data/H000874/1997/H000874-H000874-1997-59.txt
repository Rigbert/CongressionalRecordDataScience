Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule. This rule precludes the one opportunity that Members will have to vote against late-term abortions, elective or otherwise.  Hear me now, Mr. Speaker. Voting against this rule will be the only opportunity they have to vote against late-term abortions.  Why do I say that? The American press has done a disservice to the American people in characterizing the bill before us as a late-term abortion bill. It is not. It does not mention late term. It is not about late term. It is about a procedure.  The gentleman from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] was accurate on that matter. I want to refer to some of the things that the gentleman from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] said, because the Republicans rightfully point to a man who has experience and, therefore, can speak with more experience than the rest of us.  First of all, he said that this bill that is pending before us does not preclude a single abortion, not one. It does not preclude one abortion, if we vote and pass this bill and the President signs it. It does prohibit a procedure.  I further asked the gentleman from Oklahoma how many of these abortions, as a matter of fact, he said, that were done through this procedure were elective. He said approximately 80 percent, that has been repeated a number of times, were elective.  I say to my colleagues, if they vote against the rule and allow the Hoyer amendment to be offered, they will have an opportunity to preclude every one of those 80 percent abortions that, as the gentleman from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] said, most were done postviability.  Let me make my statement absolutely accurate. Every postviability elective abortion, not just done with this procedure but any procedure, will be outlawed. I want my colleagues to understand, voting against this rule and voting for the Hoyer amendment, which is the Daschle-Snowe, Democratic minority leader and Republican Senator from Maine, the Daschle amendment, is the only opportunity we will have to vote against late-term abortions and have the Federal law essentially like 43 other States.  This is not an isolated judgment nor an independent act or amendment. This is an amendment that 43 legislatures have essentially said ought to be the law. What does it say? It says that it permits a postviability abortion only if the life of the woman is endangered, to that extent it tracks the Hyde language, or if carrying the fetus to term would present the, and I quote, risk of grievous injury to her physical health. It therefore precludes any claim that this is a Mack truck exception for mental health.                              {time}  1145  It specifically requires grievous physical risk. The amendment defines grievous injury as meaning that the continuation of the pregnancy would directly result in, and again I quote from the Hoyer-Daschle amendment, a severely debilitating disease or impairment, or prevents a physician from providing necessary treatment for a life-threatening condition; for example, a fast spreading cancer, the treatment of which, aggressive chemotherapy, would be incompatible with carrying a healthy fetus to term.  My colleagues, this imposes a $250,000 fine and possible revocation of license on the doctor who violates this.  I want to make it very clear to everybody in this House I am opposed to late term elective abortions. They should not happen in America. If, on the other hand, we have at risk the life of the mother, that is a wrenching judgment that the mother and her physician will have to make, and I will not interpose my judgment in that critical situation.  So I ask the Members of this House to give us an opportunity to state clearly the policy of the United States of America that late-term abortions are against public policy. The only way we can do that is to vote against this rule so that this amendment can be offered to this bill.
