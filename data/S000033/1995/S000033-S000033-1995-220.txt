 Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak in support of the amendment. I thank the chairman very much and would like the opportunity, if the gentleman from California would respond, just to ask him a brief question, if I might.  My ears may have been playing a trick on me, but I thought I heard the gentleman a moment ago say something quote unquote about homos in the military. Was I right in hearing that expression?
