  Mr. Kenny Baker of Letcher County passed away in July of 2011. He was 85 years old. Although Mr. Baker is no longer with us, his monumental contribution to the musical world will remain for many years to come.  Mr. Baker was most widely known for his innovative style of fiddle playing that many have referred to as ``long bow fiddling.'' He would use every inch of the bow, from tip to tip, to produce a sound unlike any other in the world of bluegrass music. Mr. Baker picked up the fiddle at the young age of 5 years old and went on to write an astonishing 92 musical numbers throughout his lifetime.  He enlisted in the U.S. Navy during World War II and was assigned to a destroyer escort ship in the Pacific theater. But once the Navy learned of his musical ability, he was quickly transferred from his station to entertain troops in the South Pacific. After honorable service to his country in the Armed Forces, Mr. Baker returned to Letcher County and found work in the coal industry of eastern Kentucky but his musical journey was far from over.  Kenny Baker started playing the fiddle professionally in 1953 and played in the company of musical greats such as Don Gibson, Bobby Osborne, Josh Graves, and famous bluegrass innovator Bill Monroe. After taking a few years to get acquainted with the world of the music industry, he finally settled down and found a permanent home in the band Monroe's Blue Grass Boys.  On Mr. Baker's extensive musical journey, he regularly played at the Grand Ole Opry, recorded hit albums, played numerous concerts, and even had the distinct honor to play the fiddle for President Jimmy Carter at the White House. However, his greatest achievement came when he was named to the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor in 1999.  Mr. Baker spent his final years teaching children the value and importance of music in their lives. His generosity and love for music and music education will be greatly missed, not only by his wife Audrey Baker; his sons, Johnny Lee and Kenneth Junior; and many other beloved family members and friends, but also by generations of fans and fans to come of bluegrass music, as well as the residents of the great Commonwealth of Kentucky.  So, Mr. President, I would like to ask that my Senate colleagues join me in honoring Mr. Kenny Baker not only for his service to our country but also for his great contributions to the creative field of music. The Lexington Herald-Leader recently published an article recognizing Mr. Baker's incredible life. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, July 12, 2011]                              Kenny Baker                         (By Jennifer Hewlett)       When Kenny Baker played the fiddle, the notes flowed out      like honey pours from a jar--smooth, thick and wide,      according to his friends.       ``All your great fiddle players in Nashville, when they      heard Kenny, they knew there was a lot more to be had with a      fiddle, a lot more to learn.'' said Ronnie Eldridge, a close      friend.       ``He was the best at hoedowns. Nobody could touch him on      the waltz. He was a singer's dream.'' Eldridge said.       Mr. Baker, 85, a Letcher County native who spent many years      performing with legendary bluegrass musician Bill Monroe,      penned 92 instrumentals and tutored many others in his ``long      bow'' fiddling style, died Friday, just a few days after his      last jam session. Mr. Baker, who lived near Gallatin, Tenn.,      died of complications from a stroke.       Mr. Baker first picked up a fiddle when he was 5, according      to his son, Kenneth Baker Jr. of Columbus, Ohio. Mr. Baker's      father had been an old-time fiddle player.       Mr. Baker later turned to the guitar, but he eventually      went back to the fiddle. He grew up inspired by jazz, his son      said.       After joining the Navy during World War II, Mr. Baker was      soon transferred off a destroyer escort ship to entertain      troops in the South Pacific. After military service, he      returned home to Letcher County, got married, worked in coal      mines and played at barn dances on weekends.       He started playing the fiddle professionally with country      musician Don Gibson. In 1953, Mr. Baker went from playing      Western swing and dance-band tunes to bluegrass music,      performing with Monroe, who is known as the father of      bluegrass music, beginning in 1957. After a few years, he      went back to the coal mines in eastern Kentucky. He returned      to Monroe's Blue Grass Boys band in 1968 and left again in      1984, but he was reunited with the band in 1994 at Monroe's      Bean Blossom bluegrass festival.       Monroe's well-known ``Uncle Pen'' album features Mr. Baker      on the fiddle.       ``He was just absolutely the backbone of that band,''      Eldridge said.       ``They were at the White House one time. Bill Monroe's      group was invited by Jimmy Carter and Rosalynn Carter,''      Kenneth Baker Jr. said. ``He liked to say when Rosalynn had a      request, she came to Dad.''       Many people went to bluegrass music festivals to hear Kenny      Baker play the fiddle as much as they went to hear Bill      Monroe sing, bluegrass music great Bobby Osborne said.       Many great fiddlers, past and present, are indebted to      Baker, said Osborne, who performed with Mr. Baker and shared      a dressing room with him at the Grand Ole Opry.       ``I couldn't single him out as the top player of all time,      but a lot of people would,'' Osborne said.       Mr. Baker's son said technique and a great memory made his      father stand out.       ``Dad would use the bow from tip to tip. That made his      fiddling so smooth, and that was something different in the      bluegrass world,'' Kenneth Baker Jr. said. ``It was all by      ear, and he had a tremendous ability to recall just about any      song that people asked for--hundreds of songs.''       Mr. Baker was particularly proud of the songs he wrote and      recorded, his son said.       ``At any of the major fiddle contests, probably a third of      the tunes played will be Bill Baker tunes,'' Eldridge said.       Said Osborne: ``The tunes that he wrote, they were so down      to earth. The melodies that he put to his tunes were so easy      to learn.''       After 1984, Mr. Baker performed in many shows with dobro      great Josh Graves.       In 1993, Mr. Baker received a National Heritage Fellowship      from the National Endowment for the Arts. In 1999, he was      named to the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor in      Owensboro.       In addition to his son, Mr. Baker is survived by his wife,      Audrey Baker; another son, Johnny Lee Baker of Nashville; two      sisters; a brother; four grandchildren; and several great-      and great-great-grandchildren.       Services will be at 2 p.m. Tuesday at Burdine Freewill      Baptist Church in Letcher County. Carty Funeral Homes in      Jenkins is handling arrangements.                          ____________________
