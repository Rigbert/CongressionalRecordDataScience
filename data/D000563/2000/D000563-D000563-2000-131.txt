President, it is my understanding that my friend and colleague from Georgia, Senator Cleland, has permission to speak for 10 minutes under our agreement and that I have 25 minutes. Since Senator Cleland is now on the floor, I ask unanimous consent he be allowed to speak before me and that I follow him with my 25 minutes.
