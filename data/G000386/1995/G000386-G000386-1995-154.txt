 President, today I am introducing a bill which, if enacted, would correct a serious problem created by the Medicare anti-duplication provisions contained in the Social Security Act Amendments of 1994 (P.L. 103-432) and by subsequent interpretations of those provisions by the Health Care Financing Administration.  The genesis of this problem is to be found in provisions included in OBRA 1990. Those provisions were designed to prohibit the sale of Medicare Supplemental Insurance Policies [Medigap policies] to Medicare beneficiaries already covered by another Medigap policy. Even though those provisions were clearly designed to apply only to duplicative Medigap policies, they could be interpreted, and were interpreted by many, as prohibiting the sale of any other health insurance product that might duplicate benefits available under Medicare to Medicare beneficiaries.  The Social Security Act Amendments of 1994 contained provisions designed to clarify the intent of the OBRA 1990 provisions. unfortunately, the statute, and recent interpretations of it by the Health Care Financing Administration, have led to further confusion and potential disruption of the long term care insurance market as well as the market for other private, non-Medigap, health insurance sold to Medicare beneficiaries.  Rather than determine the extent of actual duplication, HCFA has arbitrarily deemed all private insurance to be duplicative without actual findings of Medicare duplication. A legislative correction is necessary because HCFA was fully aware of the legislative history and nevertheless issued a notice clearly in conflict with the legislative intent.  For private long term care policies, HCFA's interpretation implies that those which coordinate with Medicare are not permitted. Ironically, coordination of private long term care insurance with Medicare is consistent with an emerging national policy that duplicative coverages should be discouraged. Most of the health care reform bills that addressed long term care required such coordination. And almost all the congressional proposals that would clarify the tax treatment of long term care insurance have consistently required coordination with Medicare.  Under the 1994 amendments, hospital indemnity policies, or policies that pay benefits to policy holders upon the occurrence of a specific disease, may be sold to Medicare beneficiaries only if they contain a statement to the effect that they duplicate Medicare. However, such policies do not duplicate Medicare. State insurance commissioners have for years advised that consumers be told that such policies are not broad-based health insurance like Medicare or MediGap policies. That is, that they are not, by their very nature, a type of policy that duplicates Medicare. Furthermore, they pay a cash benefit when triggered by a specific event, such as hospitalization, or treatment for a particular disease, regardless of other coverage. Thus, the policy holder receives a direct cash payment even when the medical services received were paid by Medicare. The direct cash payment is not a payment for those medical services and may be used by the recipient for any purpose.  Any number of circumstances would lead an individual to desire such additional coverage. For instance, it is frequently the case that treatment of serious diseases generate other, out-of-pocket, expenses not covered by Medicare against which a Medicare beneficiary may wish to be protected. Or, an individual may lose wages due to hospitalization and wish to be protected against that loss.  Requiring confusing disclosure statements may discourage the sale of such policies to Medicare beneficiaries. This despite the fact that the beneficiary may be inclined to purchase such a policy, and despite the fact that the individual may clearly ultimately benefit from holding such a policy.  The bill I am introducing today to correct these problems follows a bill sponsored by Senators Packwood and Bentsen (S. 2318) which passed the Senate but was vetoed as part of H.R. 11, the 1992 tax bill. And last year the Ways and Means Committee included in their version of the Health Security Act a similar ``safe harbor'' for policies that always pay benefits. My bill would:  Restore a ``safe harbor'' for those policies that always pay benefits regardless of other coverage; and  Provide a ``safe harbor'' for long term care and similar policies that coordinate benefits to prevent Medicare duplication.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          Summary of Medicare Consumer Protection Act of 1995       1. Continues current Medigap rules.--Prohibits the sale of      more than one Medigap policy (unless replacement). Continues      current law provisions that also require signed statements      from Medicare consumers before replacing Medigap policies.       2. Continues anti-duplication rules.--Prohibits      ``duplication'' of Medicare benefits by private insurance.      Continues current law provision intended to protect Medicare      consumers from purchasing private insurance that duplicates      Medicare.       3. Safeharbor for policies that always pay.--Continues the      original 1980 safeharbor for policies that ``always pay''      (also follows the 1992 Bentsen-Packwood proposal, and the      1994 Rangel proposal to H.R. 3600). Permits the sale of      private health insurance policies that pay benefits      regardless of other coverage so Medicare consumers always      receive benefits for premiums paid.       4. Safeharbor for LTC, home health, other policies.--     Establishes a new safeharbor for long-term care, home-health,      other similar policies that ``coordinate'' or offset with      Medicare to prevent duplication (also requires ``notice'' in      outline of coverage). Permits the sale of private health      insurance policies covering benefits for only long-term care,      nursing home, home health, community-based care, or a      combination. Permits continuation of Robert Wood Johnson      Partnership plans.       5. Clarifies confusing, wrong interpretation.--Removes      misleading HCFA disclosure statements published in a June 12      ``notice'' that declares all private insurance to be      ``duplicative'' of Medicare. The statements were established      without factual findings of duplication and outside federal      rulemaking requirements; will confuse beneficiaries over what      really ``duplicates'' Medicare; will conflict with current      state/NAIC disclosure rules that such policies do not      supplement Medicare; and needlessly discourage choice and      purchase of private health insurance supplements.       6. Clarifies Federal-State role.--Establishes duplication      of Medicare as a federal issue. Provides federal penalties to      be the exclusive remedy; provides exclusive federal interest      in preventing Medicare duplication; and continues State      regulation of all other matters relating to health insurance      policies under current State law.       7. Clarifies effective date.--Establishes safeharbor (only      for policies meeting standards) from legal action based on      ``unsettled,'' unintended law prior to 1995 and after 1990      drafting ``error.'' This also: prevents frivolous lawsuits      that will cost consumers and benefit only lawyers; and      provides needed certainty in the marketplace due to      misinterpretations of intent and law.                                 ______      By
