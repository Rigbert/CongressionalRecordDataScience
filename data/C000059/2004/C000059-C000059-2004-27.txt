Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  As my friend, the gentleman from California (Mr. George Miller), knows, negotiating water agreements is not easy; and we have had numerous conversations about the subject of water over the years. And certainly he has a long history in water in the State of California. As everyone knows who has been involved in water negotiations, they are difficult. There are conflicts all over the place. One of the concepts that we took when we went down this road was balance; and the Record of Decision that was a difficult Record of Decision to come to a conclusion, part of that was water storage on four projects. There were a lot more water projects that were being considered in that Record of Decision, but it was weaned down in difficult negotiations to really a limited amount of water storage.  Over $12 million has been spent to date on looking at the feasibility of these four projects. All of the environmental laws must be met, and that is considerable, before any of these projects could ever become feasible. And even then if in fact they are deemed feasible, you would have to go through the appropriation process.  As I would point out to my friends, the Auburn Dam is an authorized project. I doubt if it will ever get appropriations to build. Unless a project is feasible, unless it has the political support in order to build, it will not happen.  And so I would say this motion to recommit takes the balance out of the process that we put together, and I believe it would remove all support for this CALFED process to continue. So I would urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the motion to recommit and vote ``yes'' on final passage.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
