 The primary goal of the Adoption and Safe Families Act is to make the safety and well-being of children paramount in child welfare decisions. In addition, in order to receive funds under the Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program, states must develop a plan to assure safety and permanency for children who enter the state's foster care system.  Adoption assistance is minimal especially when you think about the cost of raising a child. Families who adopt are highly unlikely to adopt children for the financial benefit. Nationally payments made on behalf of an eight-year-old average only $14 per day. This is a fraction of what the Department of Agriculture suggests is needed to raise a child.
