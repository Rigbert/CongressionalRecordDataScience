Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  This has been an interesting hour, considering the time we put into the debate of the bill that was before us 2 weeks ago. Everybody is thanking everybody. I like that better than hollering at one another.  I again would suggest that the House did itself proud today. And I have never been prouder than now, being a House Member. And the more I am around this body, the prouder I am about the quality of the people that work here, the intelligence which they bring to this body, the diversity that they bring to this body. This is truly America. This is the House of the people.  As the gentleman from Minnesota mentioned, we have a House product. It may have a Senate name on it, it may be a Senate number, but this is truly a House product, because we had peoplelike the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski), the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar), and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio). We may disagree on many things, but on this issue we agreed on the best security system, and today we have achieved that.  The gentleman from Minnesota also mentioned the staff, and I will not mention all the names, because I probably would forget somebody, but I will say that I am deeply proud of their work and of the time they put in, because we have had a product brought to this House that I believe is the finest piece of legislation for aviation that has ever passed.  Yes, we will continue to oversee, and we will be involved, and we will make sure this system works as we envision it working, because I truly believe the American people want that. But America has won today, this House has won today, and I am deeply proud of being chairman of this committee.
