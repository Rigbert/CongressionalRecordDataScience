I know what he is trying to achieve. I salute him for that and of course the President as well.  Let me hope that one thing emerges from this. I remember serving in the House of Representatives, and we voted on the invasion of Kuwait under President George H.W. Bush. I had my questions about that. I voted no. The House voted yes to go forward with that foreign policy. The Speaker of the House, Tom Foley, if I am not mistaken, followed that vote, where we decided to go forward with the invasion of Kuwait, with a resolution saying that now the foreign policy had been decided by this country, we should stand together in a bipartisan fashion to support our men and women in uniform who were engaged in this conflict. That happened, and we all voted for it--even those of us who disagreed with the policy.  Even after this vote on Iraq where 23 of us had voted no, virtually all of us voted for the resources that our military needed. My thinking was: Durbin, even if you disagree with the Iraqi invasion, what if that were your son over there? Wouldn't you want him to have everything he needs to come home safe? You bet.  What I hope will emerge, even after the heat of debate over this whole question of ISIL and how we deal with them, is this coming together--a bipartisan coming together behind our troops, behind our pilots, behind those advisers on the ground. Let us show them solidarity behind their effort if we decide to vote to go forward. There is too much partisan division, and it certainly ought to stop at the water's edge when it involves support for our men and women in uniform.  So at the end of this vote today, I hope we will see emerging a bipartisan consensus that we are going to work as a Nation to accomplish our goal to end this terrorism as best we can or slow it down in this part of the world and stand behind the men and women of our Nation who are willing to risk their lives in service to that cause.  I yield the floor.
