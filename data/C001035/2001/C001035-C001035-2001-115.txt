President, I rise to introduce the Civil Rights Tax Relief Act of 2001, a bill designed to promote the fair and equitable settlement of civil rights claims. I am very pleased to be joined today by Senators Bingaman, Grassley, Daschle, Jeffords, Sarbanes, Harkin, Corzine, and Leahy.  The primary purpose of this bill is to remedy an unintended consequence of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, which made damage awards not based on ``physical injuries or physical sickness'' part of a plaintiff's taxable income. Because most acts of employment discrimination and civil rights violations do not cause physical injuries, this provision has had a direct and negative impact on plaintiffs who successfully prove that they have been subjected to intentional employment discrimination or other intentional violations of their civil rights. The problem is compounded by the fact that plaintiffs are now taxed on the entirety of their settlements or damage awards in civil rights cases, despite the fact that a portion of a settlement or award must be paid to the plaintiff's attorney, who in turn is taxed on the same funds! This double taxation of awards of attorneys' fees serves to penalize Americans who win their civil rights cases.  I would like to share one example of how individuals can be harmed by the current taxation scheme, and even discouraged from challenging workplace discrimination. The example was brought to my attention by David Webbert, an attorney who practices in Maine's capitol, Augusta. In the case, David represented a person who successfully challenged a business' policy of discriminating against persons with a particular type of disability. As a result of the case, the discriminatory policy was declared illegal and was ended. Although the plaintiff did not seek any monetary damages in the case, the law did provide for payment of attorney's fees, which were paid by the defendant's insurance company. Because of the current law's double taxation of attorney's fees, they were taxable to the plaintiff in this case, despite the fact that they were also taxable to the attorney. In short, plaintiffs in civil rights cases like this could have to pay taxes despite receiving no monetary award. Or, in other words, under current law, a plaintiff can be penalized financially for bringing a meritorious case against a company's discriminatory policies.  Our bill would eliminate the unfair taxation of civil rights victims' settlements and court awards; taxation that adds insult to a civil rights victim's injuries and serves as a barrier to the just settlement of civil rights claims.  Our bill would change the taxation of awards received by individuals that result from judgments in or settlements of employment discrimination cases. First, the bill excludes from gross income amounts awarded other than for punitive damages and compensation attributable to services that were to be performed, known as ``backpay'', or that would have been performed but for a claimed violation of law by the employer, known as ``frontpay''. Second, award amounts for frontpay or backpay would be included in income, but would be eligible for income averaging according to the time period covered by the award. This correction would allow individuals to pay taxes at the same marginal rates that would have applied to them had they not suffered discrimination. Third, the bill would change the tax code so that people who bring civil rights cases are not taxed on the portion of any award paid as fees to their attorney. This provision would eliminate the double-taxation of such fees, which would still be taxable income to the attorney.  The Civil Rights Tax Relief Act would encourage the fair settlement of costly and protracted litigation of employment discrimination claims. Our legislation would allow both plaintiffs and defendants to settle claims based on the damages, not on excessive taxes that are now levied.  Our bill has been endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the American Small Business Alliance, AARP, the National Whistleblower Center, the National Employment Lawyers Association, numerous state and local bar associations and sections, including the Maine State Bar Association, Labor and Employment Section, and others. This bill is a ``win-win'' for civil rights plaintiffs and defendant businesses. We invite our colleagues to join with us in support of this common sense legislation.                                 ______                                       By
