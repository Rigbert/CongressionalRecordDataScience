Chairman, what we have been hearing here is, we still, I still see a line 7 and 8, shall and may. So that part has not changed. This was just handed to me. And then I guess perhaps you took out the enforcement part. So enforcement is still in, but it is now, we are going to enforce something that you may do or you may choose.  The problem I have here is water pollution does not really follow State boundaries. I heard a lot of talk about States rights here. But water pollution does not rather strictly adhere to States' boundaries.  And many of the bodies of water we are talking about in this bill deregulating happen to affect more than one State. In my region, we border California and Washington. We have upstate concerns, upstream concerns with Idaho, Montana, another country even, dealing with the Columbia River. So I have a concern when we begin to move major mechanisms we have to deal with precious coastal estuaries, fragile estuaries, extraordinarily valuable resources in terms of shellfish where we have had shellfish beds close, spawning grounds for our endangered salmon. And we are going to go to something that says, you may, you may, if you so choose, comply.  Well, certainly, I do not believe my neighboring State of Washington or California is going to do anything to our detriment, but on the other hand I would be a lot more comfortable if we were applying a uniform Federal standard in this bill and not weakening that standard.                              {time}  1715
