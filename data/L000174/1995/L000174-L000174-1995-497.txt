I understand we have some votes at 4 o'clock, or something to that effect. Mr. President, I advise my colleagues and friends that I would be perfectly willing to go forward with the so-called interLATA amendment, if that would be helpful, right after the vote. I have to speak with some of the other cosponsors, but I would be happy to enter [[Page S8235]] into a relatively short time agreement and an agreed-upon time to vote on it.  As my colleagues know, I rarely bring up anything that is going to take very long. I do not want to hold up people, and I have another amendment. So I would be very happy, once I bring it up, to enter into a relatively short time agreement with a time certain for a vote.
