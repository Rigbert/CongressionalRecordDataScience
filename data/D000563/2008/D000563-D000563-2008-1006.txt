I am glad Senator Robert C. Byrd is on the floor here to witness that statement, with which I am sure he will agree.  The fact is, as good as the House package might have been, we are doing our best to improve it. And now, as I understand it, two so-called pet projects--helping 20 million seniors and a quarter of a million disabled veterans--are now becoming pet projects of the administration. It would be great, and I hope the Republican side will join us in the rest of our bipartisan package.
