With respect to the class action, the gentleman indicated, as I understand it, that that bill has passed the Committee on the Judiciary?  Mr. DeLAY. What I was talking about is, as the gentleman knows, the Senate is debating that bill as we speak. If indeed that bill comes out as it passed by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary with no amendments, then we could very well pick up that bill and just consider it here without going through committee.
