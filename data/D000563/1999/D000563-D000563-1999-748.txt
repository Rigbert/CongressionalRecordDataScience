President, very shortly we will be joined by the minority leader, Senator Daschle, who will speak to the issue at hand. Of course, the issue is one that is positively dwarfed by the events that will occur in this Chamber later this evening. It is very difficult to stand here in the context of the impeachment trial and to speak of legislation, but I think we would be remiss in our responsibilities to the American people if we did not realize that although the impeachment trial is an important constitutional responsibility, we have other responsibilities to the American people, as well.  The Democratic package, leadership package, of legislation speaks to specific issues which many families across America consider paramount in their lives. I think it is a very realistic and a very forward-looking approach to the problems which challenge us. It addresses the day-to-day issues that matter the most to the American people: Health care, education, income security, crime, child care, a safe and stable food supply, and other critical issues.  I am sorry to report that the last Congress--the last 2 years of Congresson Capitol Hill--was largely unproductive. The results of the last national election, I think, verified the fact that most people were disappointed by the outcome of the 105th Congress. There were so many opportunities missed in that Congress, so many chances to make real changes to improve life in America that were squandered. We failed to address patients' rights, we failed to reduce tobacco use by our children, we failed to reform the sorry state of campaign financing, and increase the minimum wage. In each instance, we were stymied by the other side of the aisle that simply did not want to deal with these issues.  It appears that the only issue of great moment--and I say that advisedly--was the decision to rename Washington National Airport after our former President, Ronald Reagan. Sadly, many of my colleagues in the Senate, once they had achieved that, decided to go straight to the airport and catch a plane and go home instead of sticking around and working on the issues for which we were called to Washington.  I think the American people have other things on their minds, and I think they are looking to us for leadership.  I am happy at this point to yield the floor to the Democratic leader, our minority leader in the U.S. Senate, who will speak to the agenda which we will try to forcefully address during this session of Congress.                          ____________________
