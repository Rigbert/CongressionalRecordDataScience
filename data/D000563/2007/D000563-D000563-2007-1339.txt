President, if there is no further business to come before the Senate today, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand adjourned under the previous order.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 5:23 p.m., adjourned until Wednesday, February 28, 2007, at 9:30 a.m.                          ____________________
