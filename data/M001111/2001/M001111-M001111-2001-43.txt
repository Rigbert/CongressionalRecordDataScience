Res. 161       Whereas young people are our Nation's most important      resource, and we, as a society, have a vested interest in      enabling children to grow in an environment free from fear      and violence;       Whereas young people can, by taking responsibility for      their own decisions and actions and by positively influencing      the decisions and actions of others, help chart a new, less      violent course for the entire Nation;       Whereas students in every school district in the Nation      will be invited to take part in a day of nationwide      observance involving millions of their fellow students, and      will thereby be empowered to see themselves as significant      agents in a wave of positive social change; and       Whereas the observance of October 17, 2001, as a ``Day of      National Concern About Young People and Gun Violence'' will      allow students to make a positive and earnest decision about      their future by having the opportunity to voluntarily sign      the ``Student Pledge Against Gun Violence'' and promise that      they will never take a gun to school, will never use a gun to      settle a dispute, and will actively use their influence in a      positive manner to prevent friends from using guns to settle      disputes: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) designates October 17, 2001, as a ``Day of National      Concern About Young People and Gun Violence''; and       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation      calling on the school children of the United States to      observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
