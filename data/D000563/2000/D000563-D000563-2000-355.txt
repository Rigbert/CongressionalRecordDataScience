Think about the situation and wonder how in the world can we have a safer America if we have this proliferation of guns that is, obviously, supported by Governor Bush, as well as the National Rifle Association. Democrats and Republicans should be listening to families across this country.  To think gun violence has become so commonplace that we have accepted it is a sad testament on this great Nation. If one looks at gun violence statistics and says ``that is life,'' no, it is not. That is life in America. That is not life in any other country in the world. Virtually every civilized country in the world has basic gun safety laws and gun control laws to keep guns out of the hands of those who would misuse them and out of the hands of children. We live in a country where a disgruntled 13- or 14-year-old goes home and finds grandpa's gun, goes back to school, and kills a teacher. That is not commonplace anyplace in the world but for the United States, which I do not think we should accept, and our failure to do anything about it feeds into the cynicism of America's voters and citizenry who think we are elected to solve problems in this country. When we do not respond, it is no wonder they lose faith in the process.
