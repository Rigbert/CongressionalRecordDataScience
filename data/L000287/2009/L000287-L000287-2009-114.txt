Madam Speaker, I am proud to introduce the Gandhi-King Scholarly Exchange Initiative Act of 2009. The purpose of this legislation is to create three international initiatives that take the philosophy and examples of Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and apply them to current day issues.  In recent years, increasing youth violence has been the center of national headlines. Gangs, drug abuse, stabbings, shootings, bullying, unnecessary harm and heartache plagues schools and communities from Atlanta to Chicago and in unsuspecting urban, rural, and suburban areas all around and in between. In response to this alarming trend, I introduced the SAFETY through Nonviolence Act, a bill that would teach the doctrine of nonviolence in thought, words and actions to students, educators, local police, and community leaders. In reality, Madam Speaker, violence, human rights abuses, discrimination, unprecedented poverty, and terrorism are devastating every corner of our globe, and despite so much progress, much work remains.  In February, I led a congressional delegation with my good friend, the Gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus) to India to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mrs. Coretta Scott King's visit to the country. With an official send-off from Secretary Clinton, the delegation was welcomed by the Indian government and Indian people. Martin Luther King, III, his wife, Mrs. Arndrea Waters, and outstanding musicians from the Thelonius Monk Institute of Jazz also celebrated this historic visit with concerts, meetings, and ceremonies across the country.  The congressional delegation also met with Indian government officials, business leaders, and non-governmental organizations on issues of terrorism, democracy, human rights, child labor and trafficking, poverty, and international conflicts. Each of us returned to the United States inspired and determined in our own way to see how we could apply our experiences, our shared history, and the legacies of these two great men to some of the issues facing the international community. How can we build a new generation that understands the benefit of peace?  This legislation responds to that question. The Gandhi-King Scholarly Exchange Initiative Act of 2009 would create an undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate student exchange program in which students would travel to significant sites of the American Civil Rights Movement and the Indian Independence Movement. They would then develop proposals on how to apply the philosophies of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. to modern issues such as human rights, peaceful conflict resolution, civil rights, and democracy.  The second initiative created by this bill is a professional training module for international state, local and national government employees from conflict regions to develop international conflict solutions based on Gandhian principles.  Last but not least, the Gandhi-King Scholarly Exchange Initiative Act would develop an annual public diplomacy forum to be held alternately in the United States and India which will focus on the philosophies of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. in the resolution of global conflicts.  I believe that each person must ask themselves how we can make this little piece of real estate that we call Earth, a little cleaner, a little greener, a little safer, a little more peaceful. Gandhi once said that, ``If we are to reach real peace in this world, and if we are to carry on a real war against war, we shall have to begin with the children.'' The Gandhi-King Scholarly Exchange Initiative Act of 2009 does just that and a little bit more.  Madam Speaker, I hope all of my colleagues will support this good, common-sense legislation that should be a cornerstone of our public diplomacy efforts.                          ____________________
