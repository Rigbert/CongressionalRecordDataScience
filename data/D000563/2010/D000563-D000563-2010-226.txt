President, I know my colleague, Senator Harkin, will be on the floor momentarily to speak about the Food Safety Modernization Act. I wish to preface my remarks by thanking him personally. Tom Harkin has been not only a great colleague and friend, he has been such an exceptional leader when it comes to this important issue. It is no surprise for those of us who know Tom Harkin's congressional and Senate career. He has always been an extraordinary leader.
