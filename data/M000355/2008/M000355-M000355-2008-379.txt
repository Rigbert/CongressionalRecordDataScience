 President, to prolong it one more moment here, if that were adequate, we would not have passed the PROTECT America bill in the first place. Clearly, the 1978 law is not adequate to meet current challenges. There are many problems with the bill the House took up and passed and sent back over here. One is that it would require prior court approval before our intelligence professionals could monitor foreign terrorists overseas. So the House bill doesn't do anything about the problem. The Senate passed a good bill. I hope at some point the House will wake up here and do what is necessary to protect America.  In any event, the issue is not going away. The program may go away if we can't figure a way to get the job done. This is a very, very serious problem and I appreciate the good faith and attitude of the majority leader. The Senate is really not the problem here. Hopefully at some point the House will realize the best path forward.
