 Burns):  S. 1143. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to issue War Bonds in support of recovery and response efforts relating to the September 11, 2001 hijackings and attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, no American was spared from the horrific and violent assaults on New York and the Pentagon which shocked us all the morning of September 11, 2001. Yet, even as heroic rescue workers sift through the rubble that remains, our nation is coming together in its resolve to respond to these despicable acts. This indefatigable spirit is a shining symbol of America's resilience and purpose.  The United States will undoubtedly meet the challenges which we now face. As President Bush has stated, ``Now that war has been declared on us, we will lead the world to victory.''  Winning the war against terrorism will require the full support of the American public who stand so anxious and so willing to contribute. Therefore, today I am introducing legislation to direct the Department of the Treasury to establish a special category of U.S. savings bonds designated War Bonds.  These War Bonds will give voice to countless Americans who are looking for opportunities to make a difference in this time of need. By investing in a U.S. War Bond, patriotic citizens will have an opportunity to make a direct contribution to the war against the scourge of terrorism and provide much-needed resources for the effort to rescue the injured, rebuild the broken, and retaliate against the enemy.  America's battle against the evil of terrorism will amount to much more than the immediate steps which are being undertaken in the aftermath of Tuesday's carnage. Unlike previous conflicts when Americans had the luxury of recognizing a precise moment of victory, this battle's success will be assured only if our shores never again fall victim to terrorist acts. Thus, by definition, this war will be ongoing. As such, it will be essential for our Government to generate consistent public support for its actions.  The national campaign to sell U.S. War Bonds will serve not only to generate revenue, but will provide an opportunity to educate all Americans on the complicated nature of the terrorist threat and the resulting comprehensive nature of our response. This national effort will build on one of American's proudest traditions. Dating from the Revolutionary War through World War II, our country has relied upon U.S. War Bonds to respond to the threats posed by our most dangerous enemies. The World War II effort generated more than $200 billion in revenue from patriotic Americans eager to respond to the call of duty. I have no doubt that today's Americans will respond in kind, thus providing unprecedented support for the long road ahead.  I call on all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
