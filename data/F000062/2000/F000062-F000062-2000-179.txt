 President, I rise to send to the desk a bill cosponsored by Senator Kyl of Arizona and Senator Grassley of Iowa for reference to committee.  The bill is entitled the ``Identity Theft Prevention Act of 2000.''  The crime of identity theft has become one of the major law enforcement challenges of the new economy because vast quantities of sensitive personal information are now vulnerable to criminal interception and misuse.  What is identity theft? Identity theft occurs when one person uses another person's Social Security number, birth date, driver's license number, or other identifying information to obtain credit cards, car loans, phone plans, or other services in the potential victim's name. Of course, the victim does not know the theft has happened until he or she receives bills for items he or she didn't buy; plans for which he or she didn't contract, and so on.  Identity thieves get personal information in a myriad of ways. They steal wallets and purses containing identification cards. They use personal information found on the Internet. They steal mail, including preapproved credit offers and credit statements. They fraudulently obtain credit reports or they get someone else's personnel records at work.  All indications are that there is an alarming growth of this highly invasive crime. I believe the time has come to do something about it. A national credit bureau has reported that the total number of identity theft inquiries to its Theft Victim Assistance Department grew from 35,000 theft inquiries in 1992 to over one-half million in 1997. That is over a 1,400-percent increase. It is national. It touches every State and it impacts every area of our citizenry.  The United States Postal Inspection Service reports that 50,000 people a year have become victims of identity theft since it first began collecting information on identity theft in the mid-1990s. In total, the Treasury Department estimates that identity theft annually causes between $2 and $3 billion in losses from credit cards alone.  The legislation I introduce today, along with Senators Kyl and Grassley, tackles this issue. It makes it harder for criminals to access another person's private information, it gives consumers more tools to uncover fraudulent activity conducted in their name, and it expands the authority of the Social Security Administration to prosecute identity theft.  The Identity Theft Prevention Act makes it harder for criminals to steal personal information. First, it closes a loophole in the Fair Credit Reporting Act that permits personal identifying information such as Social Security numbers, one's mother's maiden name, and birth date to be distributed without restriction to marketers. This sensitive information would be treated under this bill like any other part of the credit report, with its disclosure restricted to businesses needing the data for extensions of credit, employment applications, insurance applications, or other permissible purposes.  This bill codifies, also, the practice of placing fraud alerts on a consumer's credit file and gives the Federal Trade Commission the authority to impose fines against credit issuers that ignore the alert. Too many credit issuers are presently ignoring fraud alerts to the detriment of identity theft victims.  Additionally, the bill requires credit bureaus to investigate discrepancies between their records and the address, birth date, and other personal information submitted as a part of an individual's application for credit, so that telltale signs of fraudulent applications such as incorrect addresses are immediately flagged.  The bill improves how credit card companies monitor requests for new credit cards or changes of address. For example, it requires that credit card holders always be notified at their original address when a duplicate card is sent to a new address.  This legislation also gives consumers more access to the personal information collected about them, which is a critical tool in combating identity theft. Currently, six States--Colorado, Georgia, Massachusetts, Maryland, Vermont, and New Jersey--have statutes that entitle consumers to one free personal credit report annually. This act makes this a national requirement. Every consumer across this Nation would have access to a free credit report. In addition, consumers could review the personal information collected about them by individual reference services for a reasonable fee. With greater access to their own personal information, consumers can proactively check their records for evidence of identity theft and uncover other errors.  We have worked with the staff of the Federal Trade Commission in preparing this legislation. I believe the staff of the FTC is supportive of this bill. This bill is also supported by the Consumer Federation of America.  We try to empower victims in this bill. This legislation calls for measures to help identity theft victims recover from the crime. In cases of identity theft, all too often victims get treated as if they were the criminals. Victims receive hostile notices from creditors who mistakenly believe they have not paid their bills. Victims' access to credit is jeopardized, and they can spend years trying to restore their good name.  This legislation calls upon the credit industry to assist victims in notifying credit issuers of fraudulent charges by developing a single model credit reporting form. However, should the credit industry fail to implement these measures, the Federal Trade Commission would then be authorized to take action.  Maureen Mitchell, an identity theft victim, recently described why this assistance is needed at a hearing before the Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology, and Government Information, a subcommittee on which I am ranking member. She said:       I have logged over 400 hours of time trying to clear my      name and restore my good credit. Words are unable to      adequately express the gamut of emotions that I feel as a      victim.  Another victim wrote to me:       I have spent an ungodly number of hours trying to correct      the damage that has been done by the individual who stole my      identity. Professionally, as a teacher and a tutor, my hours      are worth $35. I have been robbed of $5,250 in time. I have      been humiliated in my local stores because checks have been      rejected at the checkout. I am emotionally drained. I am a      victim and Congress needs to recognize me as such.  We try in this bill to do that.  This legislation targets the theft and misuse of another person's Social Security number, a major cause of identity theft. While the Social Security Administration has the ability to impose civil penalties for misusing a Social Security number to falsely obtain government benefits, it has no authority over other offenses involving the misuse of Social Security numbers. This bill gives them that authority. TheIdentity Theft Prevention Act authorizes the Social Security Administration to impose civil monetary penalties against any individual who:  (1) knowingly uses another's Social Security number on the basis of false information provided by them or another person;  (2) falsely represents a number to be a Social Security number when it is not;  That means, makes up a number, which people do.  (3) alters a Social Security card; or  (4) compels the disclosure of a Social Security card in violation of the law.  I think these provisions enable the Social Security Administration to throw its full weight into the investigation and civil prosecution of identity theft involving Social Security numbers.  In conclusion, I hope my colleagues find this bill worthy and pass it. This bill implements a number of practical, concrete measures to close down the flow of private information to individuals with criminal intent. In this new technology-driven economy, consumers don't need to be left vulnerable. They shouldn't be left without recourse to predators who are out to steal their good name.  I think we have a very practical solution. It is well thought out. It is well drafted. It has been worked out with the staff of the FTC. My hope is, when it goes to the Banking Committee, that committee would take a good look at it and pass it. This is an increasing problem. There is no reason to believe it will stop. Without Congress providing basic protections to individuals who are the victims, it will continue to grow.                                 ______                                       By
