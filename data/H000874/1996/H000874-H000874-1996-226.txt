Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in very strong support of this amendment. What this amendment seeks to do is make additional funds available, not additional appropriated funds but from existing appropriated funds, to make a greater sum available for the prosecution of war crimes and for the pursuit of war criminals.  Mr. Chairman, as many Members in this House know, I chaired for many years the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe. During the latter part of the 1980's and throughout the 1990's, our Commission held extensive hearings on the tragedy that has occurred in the former Yugoslavia and most particularly in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The fact of the matter is that since the 1930's and 1940's there has not been on the European continent the commission of atrocities against human beings based upon their ethnicity, nationality or religion, the kind of genocide, and that word properly applies, that we saw and heard testified to in Bosnia.  In fact, as many Members of this House know, more refugees were created in Bosnia-Herzegovina during the prosecution of the Serbian aggression than at any time since the Second World War. That is to say that in the last half a century we did not have the kinds of crimes that were committed in Bosnia.  During the course of testimony before the Helsinki Commission, and I know before the Foreign Affairs Committee as well, we heard of not only the murder of women, children, as well as combatant males and noncombatant males, civilian makes, we also heard of the creation of incarceration camps.  We heard of the creation of camps specifically designed for the purposes of raping Moslem women, for the purposes of degrading those women, for the purposes of intimidating those who were not in custody or under arrest or imprisonment by the Serb aggressors. We heard of the fact that this was a policy, not an aberration.  The Dayton Agreement recognizes the fact that the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Mr. Karadzic, whom previous Secretaries of State under the Bush administration and the Clinton administration have branded as a war criminal, that Karadzic continued to be the driving force behind the commission of these crimes.  In addition, of course, the military leaders of the Bosnian Serb effort, led by their general, he, too, was as a policy planning and implementing the criminal activity, the murders, the so-called ethnic cleansing that occurred on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis for a very long period of time. This policy created over 2 million refugees, some in-country and some forced to leave their country, but all forced to leave their homes and their neighborhoods.  Mr. Chairman, I urge support of this amendment so that the American people, through the Congress of the United States, will say in as strong terms as possible that we will hold culpable those who as a means of war employ genocide and the commission of atrocities to intimidate and defeat an enemy.  Mr. Chairman, if we do not do this, we will continue to see the cycle of violence that is perpetrated in retaliation for wrongs done against a people years before, decades before, indeed, in some cases centuries before.  Those of us who have traveled to Europe know full well that, particularly in Yugoslavia, we hear about the offenses that were perpetrated against a family and their antecedents, long before they may have been born. They believe that those wrongs must be redressed, and because there has been no mechanism short of warfare, short of the kind of atrocities that we have seen perpetrated in Bosnia, we have in effect set up an environment in which such atrocities were perhaps almost inevitable.                              {time}  1515  After the Second World War, the civilized society said we are going to hold people culpable. We can argue about whether war is a legitimate exercise of international politics but, that aside, civilized society has said there are certain things even in war that we will not tolerate as a civilized international community.
