It is time for Congress, even this Republican led Congress, to do its job and take action. We must send a message that no one in the chain of command--from an enlisted private stationed in Iraq to the commander-in-chief--is above the laws of our Nation.  Soon, the Senate will consider the nomination of Alberto Gonzales for the position of Attorney General. The Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Department of Justice, will consider this nomination first. As I have said many times, and as I deeply regret, the Committee has all but abdicated its oversight role with regard to the issue of foreign detainee abuse. Last June, on a party-line vote, Republicans defeated an effort to obtain documents regarding the development of interrogation policies that we believed to be in the possession of the Department of Justice.  Some of us had also asked Judge Gonzales, in his role as White House counsel, to release documents that we believed relevant to our investigations. It is true that the White House and Department of Justice released a small number of documents last summer, but that self-serving subset of the memoranda offered a mere glimpse into the genesis of the scandal. All of those documents should have been provided earlier to Congress, and still much more remains hidden away from public view.  Judge Gonzales's role in formulating the administration's policies on the detention and treatment of prisoners in U.S. custody overseas is an issue of significant concern. His January 25, 2002, memo to the President argues for a radical shift in our longstanding policy to apply the Geneva Conventions to foreign prisoners. He later defended this memo, stating that it only applied to al Qaeda and Taliban. As he stated in a June 22, 2004, news conference, ``in Iraq, it has always been U.S. position that Geneva applies . . . [B]oth the White House and Department of Defense have been very public and clear about that.''  Unfortunately, we have to ask Judge Gonzales if the Geneva Conventions are actually being applied in Iraq. An October 24, 2004, story in The Washington Post reveals yet another Justice Department memo that relied upon questionable legal reasoning in order to authorize actions that potentially violated the Geneva Conventions. The draft memo, dated March 19, 2004, was written at the request of Judge Gonzales, apparently in order to authorize the CIA to transfer detainees out of Iraq for interrogation--a practice expressly prohibited by the Geneva Conventions. I look forward to discussing these memoranda, as well as other policy decisions, in more detail with Judge Gonzales as we consider his nomination.  With the consideration of this nomination, the Judiciary Committee has the opportunity to redeem itself. In my conversations with Judge Gonzales earlier this week, I have expressed to him the need for our questions to be answered. I believe that other members of the committee, on both sides of the aisle, are troubled by certain Administration policies and are disturbed by the evidence of prisoner abuse. I hope that the Committee will fulfill its oversight responsibility now.                                                  U.S. Senate,                                 Washington, DC, October 29, 2004.     Hon. Donald Rumsfeld,     Secretary of Defense,     Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary Rumsfeld: As you know, I have closely      monitored the numerous ongoing and completed prisoner abuse      investigations instigated by the Pentagon, but remain      skeptical that these investigations will uncover the full      truth. Each of these probes is limited in scope or authority      and, therefore, none will comprehensively investigate the      abuse of detainees.       I am particularly concerned about the status of the ongoing      Pentagon investigations. In a Defense Department press      briefing on August 25, 2004, General Paul J. Kern said the      release of Admiral Albert T. Church's report was expected by      September 20, and would ``fill the gaps and seams.'' That      same day, in a separate Pentagon briefing, a senior Army      official said the Church report should be complete by mid-     September and the Formica report ``should be out soon.'' As      of October 29, 2004, neither investigation has been released.      In addition, Lt. Gen. David W. Barno stated in a Pentagon      briefing on October 19, 2004, that the report by Brigadier      General Charles Jacoby is complete, but it has not been      released.       The delay in the completion and public release of these      investigations raises two significant concerns. The first is      whether the investigations were extended due to the discovery      of abuses that previous investigations failed to uncover, or      the discovery of abuses that may have occurred since this      scandal was revealed in April. I recently received a copy of      a letter submitted to Vice Admiral Church suggesting that      abuses by soldiers and/or contractors continued even after      the abuses at Abu Ghraib were reported by the press in late      April. That letter is attached. My second concern is whether      the release of the reports is being delayed for political      reasons. I would like to believe this is unlikely, but      previous experience suggests otherwise. The Schlesinger and      Fay-Jones reports were released in the middle of a month-long      congressional recess, the Army Inspector General's report      received little attention because it was released on the same      day as the 9-11 Commission Report. Without any additional      information, I am forced to wonder whether the remaining      reports are being withheld until a politically expedient      time.       In order to better understand the current status of the      ongoing Pentagon investigations, I ask that you provide the      requested information and respond to the following questions      by November 15, 2004. I have not received a response to the      letter I sent you on October 1, 2004. 1 remain concerned      about the issues raised in that letter, which still awaits      your reply.       1. Please provide the current status and expected      completion and release dates for all ongoing investigations      into the abuse of detainees.       2. Please explain why the investigations conducted by Vice      Admiral Church, Brigadier General Jacoby, and Brigadier      General Formica are delayed beyond their expected completion      and release dates.       3. Has any ongoing investigation discovered incidents of      abuse that were not previously reported by the completed      investigations?       4. Has any ongoing or completed investigation discovered      incidents of abuse that have occurred since the Abu Ghraib      prison abuse scandal was reported by the press on April 28,      2004?       5. Can you assure me that all interrogation techniques now      being used in U.S. detention facilities comply with      international treaty obligations and U.S. laws?       As stated above, I request that you answer these questions      by November 15, 2004. Thank you for your prompt attention to      this matter.           Sincerely,                                                    Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senator.                                  ____                                                September 8, 2004.     Senator John Warner,     Chair, U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, Russell Senate          Office Building, Washington, DC.     Senator Carl Levin,     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, Russell          Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Warner, Levin, and Members of the Committee:      On behalf of the hundreds of thousands of people in Iraq,      thank you very much for holding these hearings on the torture      and abuse of prisoners in Iraq. It is a great public service.       We represent the class of persons tortured in Iraq in a      civil lawsuit brought against the two government contractors      who participated in the torture, CACI International, Inc. and      Titan Corporation.       We have learned from direct interviews conducted in Iraq in      August 2004 that the torture CONTINUES despite the publicity      surrounding the revelations of the Abu Ghraib torture. We are      enclosing for your information a detailed summary of facts      relating to the recent torture. As you will see from      reviewing the summary, it is clear that torture HAS and IS      transpiring at multiple, previously undisclosed, locations in      addition to Abu Ghraib.       We respectfully request that you place this letter and      attachment into the hearing record.       We also respectfully request that the investigation into      the detainee abuses continue and be expanded to include      locations other than Abu Ghraib. We ask that you hold      additional hearings and permit us or our clients, the      victims, to testify about what has and is transpiring. We      suggest that those hearings include questioning of      representatives from CACI International, Inc. and Titan      Corporation, the two corporations shown by the military's      investigation to be complicit in the torture.       Please do not hesitate to contact either of us if you have      any questions about the incidents described in the      attachment.     Susan L. Burke,       Montgomery, McCracken, Walker & Rhoads, LLC.     Shereef H. Akeel,       Melamed, Dailey & Akeel, P.C.                                  ____                                            Montgomery, McCracken,                                         Walker & Rhoads, LLP,                               Philadelphia, PA, October 13, 2004.     Re Incidents of Torture and Abuse.     Vice Admiral Albert T. Church, III,     Naval Inspector General, Office of the Naval Inspector          General, Washington DC.       Dear Admiral Church: We are part of the legal team      prosecuting a class action seeking to hold government      contractors CACI and Titan Corporation accountable for their      role in the Iraqi prison scandal. As part of that effort, we      have been interviewing detainees who have been tortured or      abused. We have learned of many instances of torture by      Americans (both military and civilian) that do not appear to      be the subject of any ongoing military investigation.       We are attaching for your information a report that      summarizes eleven such incidents. We would very much      appreciate learning when investigations have been commenced      with respect to the incidents described in the attached      report. We also have additional incidents to report to      whomever you designate as the appropriate person to receive      the information.       Based on the information we have learned, it is clear that      Abu Ghraib prison was not the only prison where detainees      have been and are being tortured. It is also clear that the      publicity surrounding the Abu Ghraub photographs did not      prevent torture from continuing to occur.       As I trust you know and as explained in the enclosed      affidavits signed by two experienced military interrogators,      using torture during interrogation harms not only the victims      but also places American troops in grave danger. We are very      concerned that not enough action has been taken to halt past      practices. Given that the conduct at issue clearly violates      the Geneva Conventions and United States law, we find the      insufficient oversight troubling.       We look forward to hearing from you or your staff.           Sincerely,     Susan L. Burke.                          ____________________
