President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that on Monday, April 27, at 6 p.m., the Senate turn to the nomination of Scott Fleming, to be Assistant Secretary for Legislation at the Department of Education, and that the Senate proceed to an immediate vote on the confirmation of the nomination without intervening action or debate and that it be in order now to order the yeas and nays on the nomination.
