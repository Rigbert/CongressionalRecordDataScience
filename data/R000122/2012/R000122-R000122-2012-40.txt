President, today I congratulate Olivia Culpo of my own hometown, Cranston, RI, for being crowned Miss USA on June 3, 2012, in Las Vegas, NV. She is the first titleholder from our State.  A native Rhode Islander, Olivia attended St. Mary Academy-Bay View and graduated with high honors. She is currently a sophomore at Boston University and has been on the dean's list every semester. Olivia is also an accomplished cellist who has performed with the Rhode Island Philharmonic Pops Orchestra, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Rhode Island Philharmonic Youth Orchestra, the Rhode Island Philharmonic Chamber Ensemble, the Bay View Orchestra, and the Rhode Island All-State Orchestra.  I had the pleasure of meeting Olivia recently when she came to Capitol Hill to passionately advocate for ovarian cancer prevention. Olivia is an impressive and intelligent young woman, and I appreciated the opportunity to discuss this and other issues with her.  Rhode Island is very proud that such a talented young woman is representing our State. We look forward to continuing to see Olivia serve as a positive role model both during and beyond her reign as Miss USA, and wish her the best of luck when she represents the United States at the Miss Universe pageant in December. Once again, I offer my sincerest congratulations to Olivia Culpo for being the first Rhode Islander to be crowned Miss USA.
