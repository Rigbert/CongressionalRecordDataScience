I thank the chairman.  I believe whoever has given him that information is wrong. We have a product made in the United States naturally. Why would we want someone to create a Frankenstein fish to compete against a naturally created God-given gift, and have it promoted by supposedly science?  There's no science in this. In fact, they were trying to do and say we have to feed the world with artificial means. And I'm saying, okay. Do it someplace. But don't you do it with my and our salmon.  Mr. Farr, listen to me very carefully. This is a very, very important thing because this is the greatest thing we have going, Alaskan natural wild salmon being sold in the market and the benefit, what they can do to have it replaced by a genetic Frankenstein fish. I'm saying this is wrong. All due respect to the chairman.  What science are they talking about? They have a bunch of people created by the government that's going to take and put in, I call it traps or nets, and create a fish that's fed quickly. They say it can grow quicker, we're home.  Well, what people are you talking about? Mr. Dicks, you better be listening because you catch most of my salmon. Don't you forget it. You had better stand on the floor and defend this because you're in deep trouble if you don't. I'll tell you that right now.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman will please direct his comments to the Chair.
