 President, I rise on behalf of Senators Fitzgerald, Cantwell, Corzine, Wyden, Leahy, Boxer, and Durbin in modifying our amendment on energy derivatives.  As you know, we discussed this issue on the floor before, and the senior Senator from Texas had some concerns. So we spent a good deal of time talking with him and his staff. We have also kept in touch with our cosponsors. We have agreed on some modifications.
