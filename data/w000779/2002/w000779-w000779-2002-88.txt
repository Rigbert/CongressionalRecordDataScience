President, Americans today live in an increasingly networked world. The system of interlinked computer networks known as the Internet, which not so long ago was a platform used only by a relatively narrow group of academic researchers, is today a core medium of communications and commerce for many millions of Americans. According to the Commerce Department, more than half of all Americans were using the Internet by last September, and the numbers are only growing.  The spread of the Internet presents great new opportunities for the American society and economy. But there is a downside to an interconnected,networked world: security risks. The Internet connects people not just to friends, potential customers, and sources of information, but also to would-be hackers, viruses, and cybercriminals.  Last July, after I became Chairman of the Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Science, Technology, and Space, I chose cybersecurity as the topic for my first hearing. The message from that hearing was that cybersecurity risks are mounting. The complexity of computer networks and the breadth of functions handled online are growing faster than the country's computer security capabilities. New technologies, for example, ``always on'' Internet connections and wireless networking technologies, often make the problem worse, not better.  The events of September 11 make this matter even more urgent. The fact is, America needs to be prepared for the possibility that future terrorists will try to strike not our buildings, streets, or airplanes, but our critical computer networks.  Government can't provide a silver bullet solution to this problem. Ultimately, progress with respect to cybersecurity is going to require the energy and ingenuity of the entire technology sector.  But one thing government can and should do is support basic cybersecurity research, so that the country's pool of cybersecurity knowledge and expertise keeps pace with the new and constantly evolving risks. This is an area where government involvement is sorely needed.  That is why I am pleased to introduce today the Cyber Security Research and Development Act. Thanks to the leadership of Congressman Sherry Boehlert, this legislation has already passed the House by an overwhelming bipartisan vote. I hope the Senate will be able to follow suit soon.  This legislation, which has the widespread support of the Nation's technology sector, would significantly increase the amount of cybersecurity research in this country by creating important new research programs at the National Science Foundation, NSF, and National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST. The NSF program would provide funding for innovative research, multidisciplinary academic centers devoted to cybersecurity, and new courses and fellowships to educate the cybersecurity experts of the future. The NIST program likewise would support cutting-edge cybersecurity research, with a special emphasis on promoting cooperative efforts between government, industry, and academia.  I believe the stakes are high. In addition to the damage that cyberattacks could cause directly, the mere threat of security breaches can cripple the ongoing development of e-commerce. If the Internet is to reach its full potential, security must be improved.  I therefore urge my colleagues to join me in making cybersecurity research and development a top priority, and to work with me in moving this bill forward.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2182       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Cyber Security Research and      Development Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds the following:       (1) Revolutionary advancements in computing and      communications technology have interconnected government,      commercial, scientific, and educational infrastructures--     including critical infrastructures for electric power,      natural gas and petroleum production and distribution,      telecommunications, transportation, water supply, banking and      finance, and emergency and government services--in a vast,      interdependent physical and electronic network.       (2) Exponential increases in inter-connectivity have      facilitated enhanced communications, economic growth, and the      delivery of services critical to the public welfare, but have      also increased the consequences of temporary or prolonged      failure.       (3) A Department of Defense Joint Task Force concluded      after a 1997 United States information warfare exercise that      the results ``clearly demonstrated our lack of preparation      for a coordinated cyber and physical attack on our critical      military and civilian infrastructure''.       (4) Computer security technology and systems implementation      lack--       (A) sufficient long term research funding;       (B) adequate coordination across Federal and State      government agencies and among government, academia, and      industry; and       (C) sufficient numbers of outstanding researchers in the      field.       (5) Accordingly, Federal investment in computer and network      security research and development must be significantly      increased to--       (A) improve vulnerability assessment and technological and      systems solutions;       (B) expand and improve the pool of information security      professionals, including researchers, in the United States      workforce; and       (C) better coordinate information sharing and collaboration      among industry, government, and academic research projects.     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.       For purposes of this Act--       (1) the term ``Director'' means the Director of the      National Science Foundation; and       (2) the term ``institution of higher education'' has the      meaning given that term in section 101 of the Higher      Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001).
