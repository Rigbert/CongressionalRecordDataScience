Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rescission bill. This rescission bill, to some degree, came out of the air. If it did not come out of the tax cut that we keep talking about, I am not sure where it came from.  The gentleman who now chairs the Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government of the Committee on Appropriations did not come to me at the end of last year and say ``We ought to get this out of bill. This is wrong. It should not be in the bill.'' I did not hear any other ranking member say that in committee, as I recall, and certainly not the $16.4 or $17 billion. If that did not come simply because we needed to get money for a tax cut, I do not know where it came from. Nobody has told me where that magic figure came from.  The fact of the matter is we passed a bill which balances the budget by 2002. That is fine. I voted for one of the amendments that did exactly that; not for the one that had the tax cut in it, but for the other one, because I thought the priorities were better, and the priorities in this rescission bill stink. That is what the President said, and he was telling the truth. He was not lying.  The fact of the matter is the priorities in this bill are not for the children pictured in the last debate. Summer jobs go down the drain in this bill, for young people that need that experience and need that future. That is not a policy that is looking to have people fly, I suggest.  This rescission bill is ill-considered, in that it does not address what are really the priorities of this country. There is no priority to cut the taxes for the wealthiest 10 percent in America. I would like to cut their taxes. Very frankly, most of us fall within that category, and we will personally benefit from that tax reduction. However, the fact of the matter is there are a lot of people in this country who need the opportunity to succeed, and this bill takes it away from them.
