Speaker, I yield myself 1\1/2\ minutes.  Mr. Speaker, on July 25, 2000, the House of Representatives, by a vote of 417-0, passed the Innocent Child Protection Act. This bill would prohibit either the Federal Government or any State from executing a woman while she carries a child in utero. That bill defined ``child in utero'' in the same language as the legislation that is before us.                              {time}  1145  We heard the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler), and others, talk about two-cell zygotes and other terms that have been used during the development of the Homo sapiens, but the protection that was given to the child in utero by the bill that passed last year by a vote of 417-0, I have the roll call here. I noticed the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler) endorsed this definition when it came to the death penalty, as did the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Maloney) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren). Why should we not use the same definition that everybody endorsed last year when it came to executing pregnant women at the State and Federal level in the legislation that sets up this separate crime?  I intend to be consistent in my votes by voting for this definition in this bill, as I did last year for the definition in the other bill.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Pence).
