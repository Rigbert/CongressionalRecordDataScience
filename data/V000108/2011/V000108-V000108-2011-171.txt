Speaker, it is my distinct honor to rise today to honor one of Indiana's fine organizations, the Coolspring Democratic Club, and to congratulate its membership as they celebrate the club's 50th Anniversary. In honor of this momentous occasion, the members of the Coolspring Democratic Club will be celebrating with dinner and entertainment on Saturday, October 8, 2011, at the American Legion Post 37 in Michigan City, Indiana.  The Coolspring Democratic Club, which was founded in 1961, was established to promote the general ideals of the Democratic Party in LaPorte County and to promote the general welfare of the entire community. In 1961, nine individuals formed the first committee, led by its commanders, Mr. and Mrs. Elvin Rodgers. Mr. and Mrs. Rodgers, along with the other committee members, had the foresight and initiative to foster change in their community and bring Democratic principles to anyone who sought to impact society in a positive way. This original committee, as well as all past and present members, will be honored at the Anniversary celebration for their commitment to promoting the ideals of the Democratic Party.  The Coolspring Democratic Club continues to uphold its mission set forth by its founding members under the leadership of its current Committee President, Dawn Proud, Vice President, Johnny Stimley, Secretary, Pat Steele, and Treasurer, Bonnie Hunt. These dedicated individuals have worked tirelessly to provide for the LaPorte County community and to promote patriotism and altruism among their neighbors.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating the Coolspring Democratic Club on its 50th Anniversary. I also ask that you join me in honoring its membership for their service to their community. Through the years, the organization's members have graced us with their patriotism and benevolence and are to be recognized for their selflessness and commitment to their fellow citizens.                          ____________________
