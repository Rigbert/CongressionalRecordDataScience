On that day, I missed 3 recorded votes. I include in the Record how I would have voted had I been present for those votes.  On Roll Call No. 242 on the Passage of H.R. 542, I would have voted ``Yea.''  On Roll Call No. 243 on the Passage of H.R. 2539, I would have voted ``Yea.''  On Roll Call No. 244 on the Passage of H.R. 2590, I would have voted ``Yea.''                          ____________________
