 President, reserving the right to object, I share the majority leader's view that we ought to turn to the postal reform bill. What I intend to do is to ask that we modify the consent that the majority leader just offered--modify his request so that on Monday, April 16, we proceed to the consideration of S. 1769, the postal reform bill.  That would give us an opportunity to further debate and discuss the Menendez proposal, which we just invoked cloture on yesterday, for the remainder of the week. So I object.
