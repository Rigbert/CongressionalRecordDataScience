President, what America wants is to solve problems, not create them. The Graham-Cassidy bill will create problems for every American family. Let's do something right. On a bipartisan basis, let's sit down and work out improvements to our healthcare system. Let's stop the partisanship when it comes to healthcare. Let's come together now.  We each have our grievances against one another, one party or the other. The American people are tired of our grievances. They are expecting us to do something positive. We can do it. Let's return to the bipartisan negotiation process.  I think that Senators Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray, Republican and Democrat, can lead us to a good path to strengthen our healthcare system.  I yield the floor.                   Recognition of the Minority Leader
