Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I cannot remember a time since I have served in the Congress of the United States, since 1981, that there has been any more supported delegation in the Washington metropolitan area of the District of Columbia than this time.                              {time}  1930  In our suburban delegation, there are no D.C. baiters or bashers. They are uniformly supporters of a healthy, vibrant region that we call the Washington metropolitan area.  The previous speaker is one of my very close friends, but I tell her, ethnic inferences go both ways. There are all types of ethnic identities that may or may not be welcome.  I will tell my friends and my colleagues, there are some 4.3 million people in this metropolitan area, and 3.8 million of us live outside of Washington, D.C., the Nation's Capitol. It is a distinct and unique city. It is the Nation's city.  Let me tell the Members how the Nation's city came about. Our early forefathers decided to have a Capitol here, and they asked some States to donate some land. They did so. Maryland donated all the land on which the District of Columbia now resides. Virginia donated some, and it was reverted to the State of Virginia.  Frankly, we in Maryland think it is very ironic that we would donate land, the Nation's Capitol would grow thereon, and subsequently, we would be told, you need not apply.  Let me tell the Members where there is not a residency requirement, where all those who live in this metropolitan area are welcome to apply and to work: In Montgomery County, Maryland, the District of Columbia residents are welcome to apply and work; Prince Georges County, Maryland, District of Columbia residents are welcome and can work; Fairfax County, the District of Columbia residents are welcome and can work there, while at the same time choosing where they want to raise their families, where they want to send their kids to school.  There has been some discussion of a waiver. Yes, there are waivers. The distinguished gentlewoman from California, who probably knows more about this issue than anybody on the floor and with whom I was involved for some period of time, discussed this matter during the 1980s and early 1990s. We had a lot of discussions.  Guess what, it was the District of Columbia City Council that decided to repeal the then existing residency requirement. Why? Because it was replete with exceptions. It was replete with exceptions for the special people, mostly who earned a lot of money. It is the average worker who does not have much clout who was squeezed by this, who cannot choose where to raise their children, where to grow that garden.  This is America's Capitol. Every United States citizen ought to be welcome, wherever they choose to live, to work in the government of the Nation's Capitol. That is why Americans come to Washington, they are proud of their Capitol, not just the 1,535,000.  Do they have a unique ability and responsibility? They do. Do I support that? I do. But when they say to the rest of us, you need not apply, stay out, yes, I say to the gentlewoman from Florida, ethnic inferences run both ways. They run both ways, I say to the gentlewoman. It is not healthy for either side to exacerbate those inferences, I tell my friend.  Yes, the two police officers gunned down defending America's House of freedom, one lived in Woodbridge, Virginia, in the District of the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Tom Davis), and one in the District of my friend, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Al Wynn), because they wanted to raise their children in a suburban setting. But they wanted to come into Washington and defend freedom's House.  Mr. Chairman, I ask Members to reject this amendment, and allow every American to be welcome to work in their Nation's Capital.
