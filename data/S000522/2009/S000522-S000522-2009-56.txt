Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the fiscal year 2010 Energy and Water Appropriations bill, and I am appreciative of the work done by the chairman and ranking member on this bill.  I would like to briefly engage the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Pastor) in a colloquy regarding an issue related to the Seattle District of the Army Corps of Engineers and the Howard Hanson Dam.  The Green and Puyallup Rivers located in part in the Ninth District of Washington were flooded by record levels of water in January 2009, causing cities along these rivers to sustain major damage. Levees along those rivers are now in need of repair and rehabilitation, and when added to the other levees that were already priorities for the Seattle district, the need for resources and action is imperative.  Following the record high level of water behind the Howard Hanson Dam on the Green River, significant structural weaknesses were discovered. Because of this damage, water levels at the Howard Hanson Dam are being held at lower-than-normal levels, drastically increasing the possibility of flooding along the banks below.  This is extremely troubling as we are rapidly approaching the upcoming rain and flood season. If the dam were to fail, or if a strong storm brings a heavy level of rain, then the levees below are at serious risk of being breached, causing significant property damage and driving large numbers of people from their homes and businesses.  I respectfully ask to work with the gentleman to ensure that the Seattle district of the Army Corps of Engineers is responsive to the flood prevention needs of those along the lower Green and Puyallup Rivers and will make the repairs of their levees a top priority.  I also ask to work with the subcommittee to make the resources needed to fix the Howard Hanson Dam available in a timely manner as they are identified.  And with that I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Pastor).
