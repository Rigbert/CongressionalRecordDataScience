 President, I rise today to honor the work of an unsung hero, COL Bradley Turner of Booneville, KY. After a 37-year career serving in our Nation's military, Colonel Turner recently retired on September 24 of this year.  Over that nearly four-decade span, he served in the U.S. Marine Corps, the U.S. Army, and the Kentucky Army National Guard. Before earning the rank of colonel, Bradley was a sergeant in the Marines, a captain in the Army, and a lieutenant colonel while in the Guard. In 1991, he was deployed in Operation Desert Storm with the 623rd Field Artillery from Glasgow, KY.  Throughout his career he earned many medals, including the Bronze Star Medal and the Meritorious Service Medal, among others. His dedication in serving our country has truly been a blessing to our Commonwealth and our Nation. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Colonel Bradley Turner for his service. The Booneville Sentinel recently published a story about Colonel Turner and his accomplishments. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record following these remarks.  There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:              [From the Booneville Sentinel, Dec. 8, 2010]          Colonel Bradley Turner Retires After 37-Year Career       Colonel Bradley Turner of Booneville has retired from the      U.S. Army Reserve after a 37-year career.
