 President, I rise today to praise the Acting Secretary of the Army, Les Brownlee, for his wonderful leadership and great job he has done under very difficult circumstances as the Army copes with the stresses of heavy involvement in the Global War on Terrorism, especially in Afghanistan and Iraq, and as he juggles many demands and complex priorities as the Army continues to transform.  Acting Secretary Brownlee is indeed a highly distinguished public servant who has performed with great humility, energy and passion on behalf of all our active and reserve soldiers and their families. I was particularly impressed with the article ``Army of One'' by Katherine McIntire Peters which appeared in the latest edition of Government Executive magazine and believe that every member should take time to read it. I ask that this article be printed in the Record in its entirety.  The article follows.                              Army of One       Acting Secretary Les Brownlee once again leads troops      through tumultuous times. On Christmas Eve 2001,      Undersecretary of the Army Less Brownlee took an Air Force C-     130 transport plane to Baghram Air Base in Afghanistan, where      about 200 soldiers were battling al Qaeda and the terrorist      organization's Taliban sponsors. It was a dangerous flight.      To reduce their chances of drawing enemy fire, the pilots      landed at night, with their lights extinguished. Brownlee      spent the evening and following day meeting with soldiers,      listening to their experiences and offering encouragement and      praise for their service. He had been in office less than two     months when he made the Christmas visit, but it established a      pattern. With little fanfare and no press attention, Brownlee      has spent every holiday since then in the field with      soldiers.        Brownlee's boss at the time, Army Secretary Thomas White,      was the public face of the Army, testifying before Congress      and participating in Pentagon press briefings with Defense      Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, while Brownlee was quietly      managing an expanding portfolio of responsibilities. In March      2002, Brownlee was made acting assistant secretary of the      Army for civil works, taking on oversight responsibility for      the Army Corps of Engineers, a position that would last until      this past August, when President Bush appointed John Paul      Woodley to the job. In the meantime, Rumsfeld fired White      last April and Brownlee became acting Army secretary. For      four months last year, Brownlee simultaneously held the      positions of Army secretary. For four months last year,      Brownlee simultaneously held the positions of Army secretary,      undersecretary and director of civil works. During this time,      the Army went to war in Iraq and began the biggest civil      works project since World War II--the $18 billion program for      rebuilding Iraq. Despite his enormous role in what is      arguably one of the most profound shifts in U.S. military      posture, Brownlee has received very little media attention, a      fact that clearly suits him. ``He's a humble and completely      dedicated man,'' says John Hamre, deputy Defense secretary      during the Clinton administration and a former colleague of      Brownlee's when both worked on the Senate Armed Services      Committee, Brownlee for Republicans and Hamre for Democrats.      ``He does not seek press. He refused to let me have a dinner      in his honor when he became undersecretary. He just said, `I      don't think that's right.' Les is one of my best friends,      and I said `Les, please, this is for you,' and he said,      `Please don't do it. I know how much you care,' '' Hamre      recalls. ``He completely wants to dissolve his own      personal identity into the good of the Army,'' Hamre says.      ``Without question, he is one of the finest people I've      ever worked with.''                         a `get-it-done fellow'       If a Hollywood producer were casting a film about the Army,      the service secretary might very well look like Brownlee. In      an interview in March he appeared tanned and fit, handsome,      square-jawed, blue-eyed, silver-haired. He wore a navy suit,      a white shirt French cuffs and a red, white and blue tie, the      uniform of official Washington, but for the Silver Star pin      in his lapel, a hard-earned award for valorous conduct on the      battlefield nearly four decades ago. Brownlee earned two      Silver Stars in Vietnam, along with three Bronze Stars and a      Purple Heart. He may look like a politician or a banker, but      he is a soldier's soldier. Brownlee's bearing is formal and      gentlemanly and he speaks in a measured, low voice. After      introducing himself at the beginning of an interview, his      first comment is: ``I've never really done this before.'' A      press hound he is not. Brownlee's resume is remarkably suited      to his responsibilities. A highly decorated infantry company      commander in Vietnam, he served a full career in the Army      before retiring as a colonel in 1984, after serving as      executive officer to James Ambrose, one of the most dynamic      Army undersecretaries in modern history. ``I though he was a      real comer and a very effective fellow,'' recalls Ambrose.      ``I think of Brownlee as a superb organizer--a get-it-done      fellow.''       After leaving the Army, Brownlee went to work on the staff      of Sen. John Warner, R-VA., a stalwart on the Senate Armed      Services Committee. Three years later, Brownlee joined the      committee staff, where he worked for 14 years, several years      as staff director under the late Sen. Strom Thurmond, the      committee chairman whose failing health greatly impaired his      participation in Senate business. ``Les single-handedly      ensured the authorization bills were produced in some very      difficult years,'' recalls Hamre. ``Had it not been for Les      to hold the committee together and move those bills forward .      . . there were a couple of years we weren't going to have      authorization bills. Les made it happen.       While working for the Senate, Brownlee oversaw some of the      most profound changes in military posture since the Korean      War. He was a major player in decisions surrounding the      reduction in military forces and the cancellation of major      weapons programs following the end of the Cold War, and he      played a key role in establishing requirements aimed at      helping the services navigate the strategically messy decade      of the 1990s.       In the summer of 2001, Bush administration officials asked      Brownlee if he would take the job as Army undersecretary. He      was still mulling it over on the morning of Sept. 11, when he      turned on the television in his Senate office in time to      watch terrorists fly a second plane into the World Trade      Center towers in New York. A short while later he spoke to      his son, A U.S. attorney in Roanoke, VA., who told him: ``You      know you have to take the job now.'' ``I knew he was right,''      says Brownlee.                             SHUNNING PERKS       To get to Brownlee's Pentagon office a visitor must walk      past an empty suite of offices designed for the Army      secretary. When he became acting secretary a year ago,      Brownlee declined to move into the secretary's spacious      third-floor suite. Nor would he let his staff change the      nameplate on his office door to reflect his position. ``The      morning I signed the papers to become acting secretary I told      my staff I would not be using the secretary's office, I would      not use the secretary's car and I did not want my picture up      on the wall [with other Army secretaries]. I assumed there      would be a nominee. It didn't seem appropriate [to assume the      perks of office]. It's a personal thing,'' he says, when      asked about it.       Last July, months after Brownlee assumed the job of acting      secretary, Bush nominated Air Force Secretary James Roche to      become Army secretary. Some observers saw the move as another      sign of Rumsfeld's widely reported discontent with the Army.      Almost immediately, Roche's nomination ran into trouble in      the Senate, where members have questioned both his role in      promoting a controversial deal to lease air tankers from      Boeing and his handling of sexual assault cases at the Air      Force Academy. Last month, after it became clear the Senate      would not move on the nomination, Roche withdrew his name      from consideration.       Whether Brownlee or anyone else will be nominated for the      Army secretary's position is a topic of speculation at the      Pentagon, but in a contentious election year, many are      doubtful. ``I don't think it really matters,'' says one      senior Army officer who asked not to be identified.      ``Brownlee is a workhorse. Soldiers respect him and he knows      how the Hill works. He's doing the job far more effectively      than many of his predecessors who didn't have `acting' in      front of their titles.'' Brownlee typically works 15 hours a      day, six days a week. He says his expectations for the job      were largely formed by his work for Ambrose. ``He had an      enormous appetite for work. The first day I worked for him he      came out of his office around 8:30 p.m. and apologized      because he was leaving early. The next day we started at 4      a.m.'' Brownlee's hours are marginally better. One of his      staff officers complains that working for Brownlee is like      being on a deployment--he rarely sees his family. When asked      what he thinks of Brownlee, he says, ``I think the world of      him.''                            SHAPED BY COMBAT       As a child growing up during World War II, Brownlee was      fascinated by military history. Although no one in his family      had served in the military--his father, an explosives expert,      ran a bomb plant in West Texas during the war--Brownlee was      drawn to service. He attended the University of Wyoming, a      land-grant school where ROTC was compulsory. Brownlee      enrolled in the Air Force ROTC program, but failed to pass      the flight physical, so he switched to the Army ROTC program.      He was commissioned as a lieutenant in the infantry in 1962      and in July 1965, he was a distinguished honor graduate of      the intensely competitive U.S. Army Ranger Course. By year's      end he was part of the 173rd Airborne Brigade, the first      major ground unit to enter Vietnam.       ``As a soldier, there's one thing worse than going to war--     that's not going to war,'' he says. He wondered if he had      what it took to lead men in battle. The rifle company      commander got his chance soon enough after deploying to      Vietnam. ``As we came under fire the first time I heard      this steady, commanding voice, and I found it very      reassuring. Then I realized it was my voice. It was very      strange,'' he recalls.       The July 18, 1966, orders for his first Silver Star award      give some measure of his experience in Vietnam. The award      reads, in part: ``With complete disregard for his safety,      Captain Brownlee dragged his fellow officer to the rear.      While performing this heroic action he was seriously wounded      in the arm and leg by intense hostile fire. Demonstrating      outstanding courage and stamina, he continued to move his      wounded comrade and lead his men to the rear. Though      seriously wounded, Captain Brownlee refused evacuation until      all the others wounded had been evacuated and an attempt at      recovering missing equipment had been made.''       Pat Towell, the senior defense reporter at Congressional      Quarterly for 25 years and now a visiting fellow at the      Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, says Brownlee      brings a personal credibility to the job that is important.      ``The [Army] is under a lot of stress. I think it's      especially important for the institution that [soldiers] have      the reassurance that the civilian who represents them in the      leadership is one of them,'' Towell says.       Arnold Punaro, who was the Democratic staff director on the      Armed Services Committee during the time Brownlee was      Republican staff director, says, ``One of Les' strengths was      that he always worked issues from what was in the interest of      a strong national defense and the country and not from a      partisan angle.'' A retired major general in the Marine Corps      Reserve, Punaro adds, ``He's a true leader. I say that from      having worked with him when he was still in uniform.''       Punaro says that when Brownlee worked in the Senate, he      came up with an important plan, called the Soldier Marine      Initiative, to get better fighting equipment to soldiers and      Marines. ``We were always buying big airplanes and big ships      and big submarines, and Les was asking `What are we doing for      the foot soldiers?' He was instrumental in improving body      armor for troops and improving the helmet and head      protection. He was in the minority at the time. That      initiative stuck and has produced a tremendous amount of good      for the soldiers and Marines.''       The improvements in body armor Brownlee championed while in      the Senate proved so successful in saving lives in Iraq and      Afghanistan that the Army in recent months faced a public      maelstrom, forcing the service to field the protective gear      more quickly and broadly than it had earlier planned.      Brownlee recently visited an armor manufacturing plant to      press managers to further ramp up production. According to      one person who was at the meeting, Brownlee left no doubt      about his seriousness that the production schedule would have      to improve dramatically. ``If it involves force protection,      then do it with the utmost urgency,'' Brownlee says. ``If you      only get it out there one day early, you still might save a      life,'' he says.       ``Here's a guy that goes almost every day to visit troops      at Walter Reed [Army Medical Center in Washington],'' says      Punaro. ``I don't think many people know that about Les, and      Les wouldn't want anybody to know about it. But this is a guy      who cares deeply about men and women in uniform and their      families. It's not just something that happened since he      became acting secretary.''                          ____________________
