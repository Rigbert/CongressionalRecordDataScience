There is a minority group which the President clearly wants to speak for and stand up for. The $44,000 in tax benefits given 2 years ago the President and the administration believe were not enough; they need to give more tax breaks to people in those higher categories.  I will bet the Senator from Minnesota knows families in his State, as I do in mine, at much lower levels who could use assistance, a few extra dollars to help pay for the necessities of life and pay a few extra dollars to put in savings for their children's education. These sorts of things are the realities of life of families. I think millionaires and people who have been fortunate to be that well off can take care of themselves. I am curious as to why this administration continues to want to throw out the life preserver to people who are floating around in their yachts. I don't get it.
