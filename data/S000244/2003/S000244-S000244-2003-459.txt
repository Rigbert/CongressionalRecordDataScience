Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee) displayed a chart that indicated that 61 percent of the malpractice cases were either settled or dropped, and she insinuated that that was for free. It is not for free. It costs money to defend those suits, to go to court, to file answers, to do whatever discovery is necessary in order to convince the plaintiff that they do not have a case, and those costs get folded into the liability premiums that the physicians have to pay.  Who gets off free? It is the plaintiff that gets off free because the plaintiff is on a contingency fee and if there is no recovery then the plaintiff does not have any lawyer fees at all.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
