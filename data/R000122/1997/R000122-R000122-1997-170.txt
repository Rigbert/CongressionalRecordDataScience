President, I rise in honor of National Sportsmanship Day, which was observed on March 4, in over 8,000 schools in all 50 States and 75 countries throughout the world.  National Sportsmanship Day was conceived by the Institute for International Sport, located in my home State of Rhode Island. The Institutes slogan, ``Dare to Play Fair,'' challenges athletes, coaches, administrators, and parents to reflect on the true meaning of competition and to discuss the importance of ethics and fair play in sport, the classroom, and everyday life.  The centerpiece of this years National Sportsmanship Day was a seminar and town meeting at the University of Rhode Island discussing the issue of violence in sport. This day long event included panels composed of professional athletes, coaches, and journalists who discussed the many different aspects of this issue.  In addition, the Institute has enlisted the help of several Sports Ethics Fellows, including the winner of baseball'sRoberto Clemente Man of the Year Award and 10 time All-Star for the Minnesota Twins, Kirby Puckett, Rhode Island's own Brad Faxon, one of the top golfers on the PGA tour and the cofounder of the Billy Andrade-Brad Faxon Charities for Children Program. These men and women are wonderful role models who can be admired for more than just their athletic prowess. They have consistently demonstrated an interest in furthering the principles of honesty and integrity in sport and society.  Indeed, the Sports Ethics Fellows are helping to teach the important lessons of National Sportsmanship Day by writing articles on sportsmanship and developing programs for National Sportsmanship Day. Through competition, young athletes can learn that while winning is a worthy goal, honor, discipline, and hard work are more important. Indeed, these values will guide them in all aspects of everyday life.  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports and the Rhode Island congressional delegation in recognizing this day and the principles it embodies.                          ____________________
