Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.  If the gentleman and my colleagues could read the amendment, it does not prescribe any format for the Secretaries of Energy or Interior to use in creating this reserve. In fact, the reserve could actually be stored in the form of the raw material which is processed very easily and can be done immediately because the processing technology is on line.  So it literally could be the type of Commodity Credit Corporation booking that we use for other grains in our country and other material that we use in refining of alcohol-based fuels. So it does not say to the Secretary that they have to buy it in this form or store it in a given form. They could actually store the grain and use the powers of the Commodity Credit Corporation, for example, to broker those reserves. But nonetheless it would be available in the country.  We are talking about a process that actually is simpler than refining petroleum and refining crude and one that is much less dirty. So if I could beg the gentleman as we move towards conference, perhaps, I would like to move forward with this amendment in some form to find a manner in which it can work and with which the gentleman is comfortable.                                       National Farmers Union,                                                   April 19, 2005.     Hon. Marcy Kaptur,     House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Congresswoman Kaptur: On behalf of the over 260,000      members of the National Farmers Union, we write in strong      support of your amendment to H.R. 6 which will establish      renewable fuel reserves as an important foundation to      lessening our dependence on foreign oil.       Thanks to your leadership your legislation can help store      renewable fuels in case of possible future consumer      disruptions. We applaud your efforts and we want to work      closely with you on making this amendment part of H.R. 6.       We look forward to working with you on this issue and      commend you for your dedication to renewable fuels.           Sincerely,                                            David J. Frederickson,                                                        President.
