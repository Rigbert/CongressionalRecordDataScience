President, I am sorry for that because we will waste more money in 1 or 2 weeks in Afghanistan and Iraq, than this would cost for years--years--to protect American law enforcement, police officers who protect us every day.  We ought to allow this matter to come to a vote and have everybody vote yes or no. The Senator from Vermont would vote yes. I know the Senator from Maryland would vote yes, and I know the distinguished Presiding Officer from Delaware would vote yes, as would every single Democratic Senator, and I believe a number of Republicans would.  We will give great speeches this week saying we stand with law enforcement. Well, as some say, put up or shut up. Let's stand with them. Let's pass this legislation.  I yield the floor.
