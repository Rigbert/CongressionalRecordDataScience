 Now, Mr. Speaker, I would like to know, and as I said last week, because of the process we are pursuing Members are not as knowledgeable, perhaps, as they otherwise would be on exactly what is going on. Can the majority leader inform me as to how much time he would expect to give Members, A, to review the conference report, and then to have consideration of it on the floor, and what procedures might be available to them on the floor?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I cannot advise the gentleman on what procedures may be available to them on the floor.  As the gentleman knows, the conference report is a privileged motion not subject to amendment. The Members, I do not know about the gentleman's side of the aisle, but my side of the aisle are very aware that the appropriations process is ongoing. I have been overwhelmed with requests and issues that are in that bill, as the chairman has, and Members are working as hard as they can to make sure their concerns are taken care of in the appropriations bill and in that process.  We are hoping that the Members will have sufficient time. This is, again, an unusual process, and the bill itself is huge, but we are hoping that we can give the Members sufficient time to review the bill. But if Members are interested, they ought to be consulting with the staff of the Committee on Appropriations right now as to what is in the bill and what might come to the bill so they might be prepared for voting on it on Wednesday.
