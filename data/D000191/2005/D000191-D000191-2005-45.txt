  Mr. DeFAZIO. Last night, the Ways and Means Committee pulled aside the curtain to show us what the direct link is between tax cuts for the wealthy and cutting programs for students and struggling families.  Dividend tax cuts for wealthy investors so they will have to pay taxes at a rate lower than a teacher or a supermarket checkout clerk. The trade-off is, well, student loans, $14 billion in cuts. But, hey, those rich coupon clippers need the money.  Then we have food security, school lunch. Those little kids are just eating too much. We get something called look-through treatment of payments between related CFCs under foreign personal holding company income rules for the same price. Nice trade-off on the Republican side of the aisle.  Then, of course, extending further tax cuts to those who don't work for a living but live on capital gains. The small trade-off for that is depriving millions of Americans under the Medicaid program of needed essential medical care and dumping those costs onto the States and those of us who buy insurance because a lot of it will be un-reimbursed care.  Great work, you guys. You're helping out your patrons and sticking it to the rest of America.                          ____________________[Page H10233]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                         BUDGET RECONCILIATION  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)
