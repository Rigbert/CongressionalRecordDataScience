President, once again, reserving my right to object, I think both the majority leader and the Senator from Pennsylvania have been operating completely in good faith, have made sincere efforts to respond to our concerns. At this juncture, I would hope we could work out, through an amendment to the consent, a provision at least to give us the opportunity to look at it. I, frankly, having just seen this, this evening, I don't know if this simply codifies what is already operating and is, in a sense, innocuous or something more. It is not my intention to try at this point to upset the agreement because I think it was reached after much effort on both sides. It is a good-faith agreement.  I wonder if there is some way we can maintain the opportunity to look at this, agree to the consent this evening, look at it, and if it is something highly objectionable, at least have the opportunity to strike.  I think the suggestion by the Senator from Nevada is a good one. Frankly, I must say I am not prepared at this moment to offer a conclusion as to whether this should be here or not. I am just surprised that a nontax item is included in the managers' amendment along with others that are relatively noncontroversial.
