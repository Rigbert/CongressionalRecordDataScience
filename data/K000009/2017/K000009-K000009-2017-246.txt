Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate the oldest park district in Ohio, Cleveland Metroparks, on celebrating their 100th Anniversary, marking a century's worth of service to our region.   In 1917, following the Ohio General Assembly's passage of hallmark legislation allowing for the creation and development of park districts, Cuyahoga County probate judge Alexander Hadden appointed the first board of the Cleveland Metropolitan Park District. In an effort to support resource conservation and through the vision and leadership of their first director, William Stinchcomb--a self-taught engineer who first conceptualized the idea of a chain of parks connecting our communities--the Emerald Necklace was born.   From modest beginnings, Cleveland Metroparks held and preserved just 109 acres of land in Cuyahoga County's western and southernmost suburbs. Yet, within their first decade, what started with just one hundred acres of donated land would soon grow to encompass 9,000 acres throughout more than a dozen communities.   As a national leader in sustainability, Cleveland Metroparks' successes in natural resource conservation, as well as innovation in green infrastructure, provide essential environmental, health and economic benefits for all people. In fact, last year, Cleveland Metroparks won the prestigious American Academy of Park and Recreation Administration's National Gold Medal Award for Excellence in Park and Recreation Management--an award that Cleveland Metroparks has received 4 times since 1994.   Our park systems play a crucial role in environmental stewardship and community health, ensuring not only the preservation and prosperity of our flora and fauna--but improving public health and wellness by preventing health related problems ranging from asthma and obesity to diabetes and mental health.   The Cleveland Metroparks also has a tremendous impact on the regional economy. Tourism remains one of Ohio's largest and fastest growing industries, producing $43 billion in sales annually. Of that, Cuyahoga County contributes nearly 20 percent, generating $8.1 billion for the economy in 2015. What's more, a recent study conducted by The Trust for Public Land found that Cleveland Metroparks alone generate nearly a billion dollars annually for the local economy.   Cleveland Metroparks has built an admirable legacy, from the Rocky River Reservation, the first land purchased by the park district, and its many trails weaving through the Valley's forests and wetlands, to the Centennial Trail improving access and re-connecting our region with Wendy Park, Edgewater Beach and Lake Erie's shore. The Metroparks have remained committed to the conservation of natural resources, the education of our community and the recreation opportunities for our friends and family.   Today, 100 years later and spanning 47 diverse communities, Cleveland Metroparks' more than 23,000 acres of preserved wetlands and forests, trails and paths, lakefront beaches, rivers and streams, golf courses and a nationally acclaimed zoo, have become a destination and gathering place for millions of runners, hikers, cyclists, boaters, kayakers, fishermen, birders, nature enthusiasts and families from all across the country.   In recognition of the 100th Anniversary of Cleveland Metroparks, please join me in thanking all those whose vision and leadership have shaped this vast network and helped create one of the most valuable and significant resources in Ohio.                          ____________________
