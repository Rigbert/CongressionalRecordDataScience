President, there will be a rollcall vote tomorrow around 2:30 p.m. on the motion to proceed to S. 953.  Additionally, the majority leader filed cloture on the nomination of Goodwin Liu to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit. As a result, Senators should expect a cloture vote on the nomination sometime Thursday.                          ____________________
