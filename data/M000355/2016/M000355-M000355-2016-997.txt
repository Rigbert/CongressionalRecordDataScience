 President, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator Thune, says that keeping Americans safe from future attacks is a top priority. He is right, of course. From Brussels to Egypt, events around the world underscore the need for stronger security measures for our Nation's air traffic.  That is why I was glad when large bipartisan majorities voted last week to advance the FAA Reauthorization Act and then to strengthen it further with the most comprehensive airline security reforms in years.  We appreciate Senator Thune's work with the Aviation Subcommittee chair, Senator Ayotte, as well as Senators Nelson and Cantwell, to move an amendment designed to keep passengers safer and to help deter terrorism in airports on U.S. soil. The amendment will help shore up security measures for international flights coming into the United States as well as improve vetting and inspections of airport employees.  I would also like to recognize Senator Heinrich for his work to include provisions that will increase security measures in prescreening airport zones and expand preparation for active shooter events.  This FAA reauthorization legislation will do more for security than any other in years. It will do more for passengers than any other in years as well.  Don't take my word for it. A consumer columnist for the Washington Post labeled it ``one of the most passenger-friendly Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bills in a generation.'' It includes a number of consumer-friendly provisions, like fee disclosures and refunds for lost bags or services paid for but not received, and does so without imposing choice-limiting regulations or fees and taxes on airline passengers.  This is a good bill and a good example of what can get accomplished with a Senate that is back to work. It would help keep Americans safe, both in our airports and in the skies. It has enjoyed support from both sides of the aisle.  If Members have additional ideas they think might strengthen the bill further, I would again encourage them to work with the bill managers so we can continue moving forward.                          ____________________
