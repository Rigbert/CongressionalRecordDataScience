Speaker, I rise to discuss the importance of maintaining trade fairness and how that fairness has been restricted in our trade relations with Japan.  Some of you may know about the market access case the United States Government filed against the Government of Japan before the World Trade Organization concerning consumer film and photographic paper. Eastman Kodak Company has been routinely prevented from competing fairly in Japan by the Japanese Government, which has been protecting Fuji film, the domestic film manufacturer. For over 30 years, the Japanese Government has worked closely with Japanese business, using non-tariff barriers, unspoken agreements, and implicit understandings to keep foreign competition out of the Japanese market.  This case has far-reaching and precedent-setting ramifications. Why? First, this case highlights the nature of our trade relationship with Japan, where trade fairness has been a recurring concern. Japan is America's second largest trade partner but maintains America's largest trade deficit, which is 43 percent of our total trade deficit. Second, this case centers around the future of the WTO as an effective forum to settle international trade conflicts.  The ramifications of the photographic film and paper case before the WTO are immense. At stake is the future of free and open market access not just for film, but, for all companies looking to trade with Japan. I urge the administration to press the WTO to bring this complaint to a conclusion.                          ____________________
