 President, I rise today in honor of an Iowa Marine who has fallen in service to his country in Iraq. Marine Corporal Nathan A. Schubert, of the 1st Battalion 3rd Marine Regiment, was killed on January 26, 2005 when his helicopter crashed during a sandstorm near Ar Rutbah, Iraq. The helicopter carried Corporal Schubert and thirty other Marines who were part of a security mission to aid in the safe conduct of the national democratic elections last Sunday. He is survived by his mother, Cheryl Winklepeck, a sister, Elizabeth Householder, and a brother, Matt. Corporal Schubert died one day before his 23rd birthday.  A native of Cherokee, IA, Cpl. Schubert attended Washington High School and went on to continue his studies at Kirkwood Community College in the fall of 2001. Just weeks after the terrorist attacks on September 11, Nathan Schubert enlisted in the Marines to fulfill what he saw as his patriotic duty. Describing Corporal Schubert as a friendly, likable, and patriotic young man, his brother noted that he ``lived life to the fullest.''  I ask all of my colleagues in this body and all Americans to remember with respect, admiration, and gratitude this courageous Marine who made the ultimate sacrifice in the name of the principles we value most as Americans: freedom, democracy, and justice. Corporal Schubert died honorably while supporting and defending these values by aiding the birth and development of democracy in Iraq. He is to be commended for his bravery as he joins the honorable ranks of those Americans who have gone before him in service of their country. My prayers go out to Nathan's family and friends and my greatest respect and appreciation go to Cpl Nathan A. Schubert.                          ____________________
