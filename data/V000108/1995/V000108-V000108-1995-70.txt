Speaker, it is my great pleasure to rise today and call your attention to Bobby Moravec of Calumet Township, IN. Bobby's story serves as an inspiration to residents of Indiana's First Congressional District, as well as all Americans. This year, Bobby, who has Down's Syndrome, competed in the Special Olympic World Games against over 700 athletes from 143 countries around the world. Bobby succeeded in winning a bronze medal for the shot put and a fifth place ribbon for the softball throw. Bobby also placed sixth in the 50-meter race.  Bobby, a student at Merrillville High School, was nominated for the World Games, the largest sporting event in the world, by Laura Smith, treasurer for the Special Olympics group sponsored by the Northwest Indiana Special Education Co-op in Crown Point, IN. Because Bobby had won a gold medal in last year's Indiana State games, he was then chosen to advance to the World Games as an athlete on the 10-member Indiana track and field team.  Bobby has been active in the Regional Special Olympic games for 9 years and the State Special Olympic games for 5 years. He has earned four gold, six silver and one bronze medal for events ranging from the 50-meter race, the softball throw, basketball, the standing long jump, the shot put, and skiing.  Bobby trains 3 days a week at Merrillville High School. His vigorous training schedule includes a day of weight lifting, walking and running around the track, and practicing the shot put and softball throw. According to Bobby's parents, Ed and Marge Moravec, his coach, Maxine Urbanczyk of Merrillville, IN, was there at each training session to prepare him for the World Games. Ed and Marge add that she gave him encouragement when he needed it and praise when he deserved it. They say that the Special Olympics needs more coaches like Maxine.  When Bobby cannot be found in the training room, he may be participating in the other activities that he loves so much. Bobby may be fishing, playing on the Challenger softball and basketball team, or bowling. During football season, Bobby can be found at Andrean High School football games, where he has been the ball boy for the last 3 years.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other colleagues congratulate and commend Bobby for his hard work and dedication to succeed, not only in the Special Olympic World Games, but in his everyday life. In a world where success doesn't come easy, Bobby has proven to be an exception to the rule.                          ____________________
