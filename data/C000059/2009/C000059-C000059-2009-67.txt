 Requesting Member: Rep. Ken Calvert  Account: Transportation & Community & System Preservation  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Riverside County Transportation Commission  Address of Requesting Entity: 4080 Lemon Street, Riverside, CA 92501  Description of Request: The Fiscal Year 2010 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act provides $750,000 for the Riverside County Transportation Commission's Alameda Corridor East Grade Separations project. There are 61 at-grade highway-rail crossings in Riverside County. These crossings are blocked by freight trains traveling from the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to the rest of the nation, negatively impacting local commerce, congestion, and air quality. The Riverside County Transportation Commission (RCTC) has prioritized the 20 most needed grade separations in the county and adopted a funding plan that includes local, state, and federal sources. The funding will allow RCTC to distribute federal funds to cities with projects most ready for construction. The significance of grade separations on the Alameda Corridor East in Riverside County has been recognized as a regional priority by the Southern California Consensus Working Group (goods movement coalition of Ports of L.A., Long Beach and Hueneme, L.A. METRO, OCTA, SANBAG, RCTC, VCTC, ACE-CA, Metrolink, ACTA, and SCAG), the South Coast Air Quality Management District, the State Goods Movement Action Plan, and the California Air Pollution Control Officers Association.

The City of Corona Transit Service (CCTS) operates a general population Dial-A-Ride that provides transportation throughout the City of Corona and the neighboring County areas of Home Gardens, El Cerrito and Coronita as well as satellite areas in the City of Norco. Three of the Dial-A-Ride buses have exceeded their useful life and require replacement at an estimated replacement cost of $260,000. The funding will provide $208,000 in federal support for the buses, while CCTS would provide a local match of $52,000. The project will benefit Corona residents by providing them with additional transportation options to Corona City Hall, the Corona Public Library, senior centers, shopping centers, hospitals and medical offices.

Ken Calvert  Account: Economic Development Initiatives, Housing and Urban Development  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: National Community Renaissance  Address of Requesting Entity: 9065 Haven Avenue, Suite 100, Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91730  Description of Request: The Fiscal Year 2010 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act provides $1,000,000 for the National Community Renaissance. The funding will allow National Community Renaissance (National CORE) to efficiently leverage federal resources to undertake one or more large-scale neighborhood revitalization projects which would preserve as many as 1,500 additional at-risk affordable apartments nationwide. According to National CORE, their comprehensive approach to affordable housing positively impacts families and seniors in the Inland Empire. National CORE owns 462 units in western Riverside County alone, which provide housing to more than 1,200 residents and has another 110 senior units under construction. The completed developments were all extensive revitalization projects that completely transformed entire communities from blighted, crime ridden neighborhoods to thriving communities where families flourish.  Requesting Member: Rep. Ken Calvert  Account: Capital Improvement Grants, Federal Transit Administration  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Riverside County Transportation Commission  Address of Requesting Entity: 4080 Lemon Street, Riverside, CA 92501  Description of Request: The Fiscal Year 2010 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act provides $5,000,000 for the Riverside County Transportation Commission's Perris Valley Line. The Perris Valley Line extends existing Metrolink service 22.7 miles further into Riverside County creating better access to popular commuter rail transportation. The Perris Valley Line will connect downtown Riverside to the UCR campus, March Global Port employment center, Moreno Valley, and the revitalized downtown Perris. The Perris Valley line will relieve congestion on I-215, which runs through the heart of Riverside County. The project is currently in the project development phase; local and state funds are being used for a majority of the current project development costs. As the project nears construction, federal grant funds will be necessary to keep the project moving forward. A current projection for opening service is 2011. The Perris Valley Line serves critical public needs in western Riverside County by providing a transportation alternative and providing greater accessibility to major local employers and employees. The project is of regional and national significance due to the congestion relief it will provide on I-215, as well as the emissions that will be removed from the air as a result of increased transit ridership.  Requesting Member: Rep. Ken Calvert  Account: Buses & Bus Facilities  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Riverside Transit Agency  Address of Requesting Entity: 1825 Third Street, Riverside, CA 92507  Description of Request: The Fiscal Year 2010 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act provides $1,400,000 for the Riverside Transit Agency's Bus Replacement Program. The funding will allow the Riverside Transit Agency (RTA) to begin its bus purchase program to eventually replace 103 buses in its aging fleet with the purchase of eight replacement vehicles. The buses to be replaced were purchased in 2000 and 2001 and have reached the end of theiruseful lives as determined by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Replacing aging buses is critical in assuring reliability of service and decreasing maintenance costs by reducing breakdowns and frequent repairs. The replacement buses would be powered by CNG and have all state-of-the-art technologies to provide enhanced passenger safety, better fuel efficiency and decreased emissions.  Requesting Member: Rep. Ken Calvert  Account: Transportation & Community & System Preservation  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Orange County Transportation Authority  Address of Requesting Entity: 550 South Main Street, Orange, CA 92863  Description of Request: The Fiscal Year 2010 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act provides $750,000 for the Orange County Transportation Authority's San Diego Freeway (I-5) Widening and Improvement project. Funding for the San Diego Freeway (Interstate 5), from Pacific Coast Highway (State Route 1) to Avenida Pico, will add additional freeway capacity along I-5 in south Orange County with consideration for a potential connection with planned San Diego County high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes on I-5. For FY 2010, the requested funds will be used to complete the required technical studies and environmental documents. This project is estimated to cost $250 million. The Interstate 5 (I-5) is the primary freeway linking Orange County to Los Angeles and San Diego counties. The project will reduce peak period delays for both commuters and goods movement carriers alike by relieving both existing and forecasted mobility problems while reducing emissions, increasing productivity and improving air quality in the region.  Requesting Member: Rep. Ken Calvert  Account: Economic Development Initiatives, Housing and Urban Development  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: City of Norco  Address of Requesting Entity: 2870 Clark Avenue, Norco, CA 92860  Description of Request: The Fiscal Year 2010 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act provides $100,000 for the City of Norco's Santa Ana River Trail. The Santa Ana River, which flows from the San Bernardino Mountains to the Pacific Ocean, is the primary source of potable water for Orange County and several cities in Riverside County. Building the Santa Ana River Trail will provide a protective corridor that will reduce pollution and prevent crowding from expanding urban and suburban sprawl. The River Trail is an essential component of the long-term effort to protect the water quality of the Santa Ana River Basin. In addition to reducing pollution, the Santa Ana River Trail will be a multi-use recreational trail that will run from the Pacific Coast to the San Bernardino Mountains. This section of the trail will link the two largest cities in Riverside County, Corona and Riverside, and provide patrons with superlative recreational opportunities.                          ____________________
