I tell my friend, the reason I want to propound this unanimous consent, it will in fact provide for a document, anact, to pass this House which I believe will in fact pass the Senate and will in fact be signed by the President.  As a result, we will protect our troops and we will protect all other services that government has available for the American people.  I ask my friend if he will yield to me for that purpose.
