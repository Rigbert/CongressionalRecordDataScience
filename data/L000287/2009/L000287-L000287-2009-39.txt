Mr. Speaker, I fully support H.R. 3357. In the future, the Ways and Means Committee will need to look at different funding proposals and administrative changes to keep the Highway Trust Fund running for the long term. Today we need to make sure it doesn't run out of money. This very simple bill does not cost a single dollar, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this commonsense, bipartisan piece of legislation.
