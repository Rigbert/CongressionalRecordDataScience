                                        House of Representatives,                             Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                     Washington, DC, July 8, 2011.     Hon. Doc Hastings,     Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, Longworth House          Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Hastings: Thank you for your letter regarding      H.R. 1938, the North American-Made Energy Security Act. The      Committee on Energy and Commerce recognizes that the      Committee on Natural Resources has jurisdiction over H.R.      1938, and I appreciate your effort to waive the Committee's      right to take action on it.       I concur with you that foregoing action on H.R. 1938 does      not in any way prejudice the Committee on Natural Resources      with respect to its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill      or similar legislation in the future, and I would support      your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of      conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or      related legislation.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation      and I will include our letters on H.R. 1938 in the      Congressional Record during House floor consideration of the      bill.           Sincerely,                                                       Fred Upton,                                                         Chairman.                                  ____                                           House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and            Infrastructure,                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 2011.     Hon. Fred Upton,     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Rayburn House          Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Upton: I write concerning H.R. 1938, the      North American-Made Energy Security Act, which is expected to      be scheduled for floor consideration the week of July 25,      2011.       As you know, the Committee on Transportation and      Infrastructure was listed as the Committee of primary      jurisdiction when H.R. 1938 was introduced on May 23, 2011. I      recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this      legislation before the House of Representatives in an      expeditious manner, and accordingly, the Committee will forgo      action on the bill.       The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure takes      this action with our mutual understanding that by foregoing      consideration of H.R. 1938 at this time, we do not waive any      jurisdiction over subject matter contained in this or similar      legislation. Further, I request your support in the      appointment of conferees from the Committee on Transportation      and Infrastructure during any House-Senate conference      convened on this legislation.       As you are aware, the Committee on Transportation and      Infrastructure is the Committee of primary jurisdiction on      any legislation to reauthorize federal pipeline safety      programs. As such, our agreement to forego consideration of      H.R. 1938 is also conditional on our mutual understanding      that the Committee on Energy and Commerce will not take any      Full Committee action on legislation related to the      reauthorizing of the federal pipeline safety programs until     the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure has acted      on such legislation.       I would appreciate your response to this letter, confirming      this understanding, and would ask that a copy of our exchange      of letters on this matter be included in the Congressional      Record during Floor consideration.           Sincerely,                                                     John L. Mica,                                                         Chairman.                                  ____                                                                           House of Representatives,                             Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                    Washington, DC, June 18, 2011.     Hon. John L. Mica,     Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,          Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Mica: Thank you for your letter regarding      H.R. 1938, the North American-Made Energy Security Act. The      Committee on Energy and Commerce recognizes that the      Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure has primary      jurisdiction over H.R. 1938, and I appreciate your effort to      facilitate consideration of this bill.       I concur with you that foregoing action on H.R. 1938 does      not in any way prejudice the Committee on Transportation and      Infrastructure with respect to its jurisdictional      prerogatives on this bill or similar legislation in the      future, and I will support your effort to seek appointment of      an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate      conference involving this or related legislation.       I also concur with you that the Committee on Transportation      and Infrastructure is the Committee of primary jurisdiction      on legislation to reauthorize the federal pipeline safety      programs and agree to not take action before September 20,      2011 at full committee on such legislation, allowing the      Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to take action      on such legislation.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation      and I will include our letters on H.R. 1938 in the      Congressional Record during House floor consideration of the      bill.           Sincerely,                                                       Fred Upton,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                               Committee on Natural Resources,                                     Washington, DC, July 8, 2011.     Hon. Fred Upton,     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Rayburn House          Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Upton: I write concerning H.R. 1938, the      North American-Made Energy Security Act.       As you know, the Committee on Natural Resources received an      original referral of H.R. 1938 when it was introduced on May      23, 2011. I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring      this legislation before the House of Representatives in an      expeditious manner, and accordingly, the Committee will      forego action on the bill.       The Committee on Natural Resources takes this action with      our mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of      H.R. 1938 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over      the subject matter contained in this or similar legislation.      Further, I request your support for the appointment of      conferees from the Committee on Natural Resources during any      House-Senate conference convened on this or related      legislation.       I would appreciate your response to this letter, confirming      this understanding, and would ask that a copy of our exchange      of letters on this matter be included in the Congressional      Record during floor consideration.           Sincerely,                                                     Doc Hastings,     Chairman.                          ____________________
