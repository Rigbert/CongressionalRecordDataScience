 President, common sense tells me we cannot have it both ways, on the one hand telling the country we need an immediate tax cut stimulus and on the other hand vote after vote delaying this bill.  To pay for these checks, the Joint Tax Committee estimates the Secretary of Treasury will have to increase taxes on small business owners by about $24 billion.  This amendment is also unconstitutional from the standpoint that article I, section 7, gives Congress the taxing powers, not the Secretary of Treasury.  If we can pass this bill today, I believe we could be on our way to putting more cash in families' hands by July 1 with the changes in W-2s that will result with the 10-percent rate going into effect January 1 this year.
