Chairman, I support the gentleman's amendment and I hope we can adopt it fairly quickly. What this amendment does is simply add the following predicates to allow law enforcement to go to a judge to seek a wiretap order: Crimes of terrorism such as arson, plastic explosives, attacks on a Federal facility with firearms, and conspiracy to harm persons or property overseas.  I think all of these are legitimate predicates. I would hope the gentleman's amendment is adopted, and thank him for yielding.
