 President, I rise in strong opposition to the Hollings amendment. The Hollings amendment would repeal the retroactive marginal rate cuts enacted on June 7th of this year. That is barely over 1 month ago.  My opposition to the amendment is based on both procedural and substantive grounds.  On the first problem the amendment's procedural problems, it is clear that, if adopted, this amendment will cause the underlying supplemental appropriations bill to violate the origination clause of the U.S. Constitution. Ifsent to the House, the bill would certainly be ``blue slipped.'' So, this amendment, if adopted, kills the supplemental.  The second problem is the substance of the amendment. This amendment would repeal all of the retroactive marginal rate reductions in the recently passed tax bill. Those rate cuts are based principally on the new ten percent bracket for the first $6,000 of income for single taxpayers and $12,000 of income for married couples.  The retroactive new ten percent bracket is the basis for the advance refund checks of $300 for a single person and $600 for a married couple. The Hollings amendment stops these checks dead. A vote for the Hollings amendment is a way to say no to American taxpayers who now expect to receive refund checks. A vote for the Hollings amendment is a vote against the stimulus in the tax bill we just passed.
