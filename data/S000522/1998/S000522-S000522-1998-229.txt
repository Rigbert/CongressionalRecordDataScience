Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4660, authorizing the provision of rewards for information leading to the arrest and conviction of war criminals and those who have committed other serious violations of international humanitarian law in the former Yugoslavia.  As Co-Chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I have followed the tragic developments in the former Yugoslavia and advocated decisive action to stop the senseless slaughter, first in Bosnia, and most recently in Kosovo. But decisive action is not limited to military intervention alone. The tragic chapters of genocide and cold blooded murder in the Former Yugoslavia will not be closed until those responsible for such heinous criminal acts are brought to justice.  Developments in Bosnia underscore the fact that there is a price--a high price--to be paid for allowing indicted war criminals like Karadzic and Mladic to remain at large. The unfolding carnage in Kosovo is most certainly the handiwork of the ``Butcher of Belgrade,'' Slobodan Milosevic. I applaud the recent passage of resolutions in the House and Senate calling for the investigation and indictment of Slobodan Milosevic as a war criminal. In fact, I introduced the measure in this House. We allrecognize, though, that true justice demands that the net be cast further than the one person most responsible.  As a supporter of the Tribunal, I believe it is critical that the Tribunal take a proactive stance in Kosovo that could serve as a possible deterrence against a new round of war crimes in the Former Yugoslavia. In the case of Bosnia, the Tribunal could only react to crimes that were mostly committed before and during its formation. In Kosovo, however, crimes could perhaps be deterred, if the Tribunal is vigorous and visible in its investigation of ongoing activity.  Mr. Speaker, we saw a couple of days ago the reports of a major massacre in three villages in Kosovo, where women, children and the elderly were slain and, in some instances, their bodies mutilated by the Serbian security forces. These scenes are all too familiar and, absent determined action, will be repeated over and over and over again. The Helsinki Commission has received disturbing reports from Senator Bob Dole and Assistant Secretary of State John Shattuck who formed a fact-finding mission to Kosovo. They told us about men being separated from women and children and simply taken away, perhaps to lengthy detention or maybe their execution. There are also reports, again of the mass rape being used as a weapon of war.  Mr. Speaker, as a cosponsor of H.R. 4660, I believe adoption of this legislation will underscore the continued commitment of the United States to see that those responsible for the war crimes and other serious violations of international humanitarian law are held accountable for their actions. While it is unlikely that the offer of rewards alone will lead to the arrest or conviction of all of those responsible for war crimes in the Former Yugoslavia, even if one war criminal is brought to justice as a result of our action today, the modest investment would have been worth the effort.                          ____________________
