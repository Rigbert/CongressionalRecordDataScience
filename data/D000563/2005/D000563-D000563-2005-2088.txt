President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.  How many of us have seen men and women going off to serve our country to risk their lives knowing that they are leaving behind families and their businesses and knowing the economic hardship they will face? Some of them are going to be forced into bankruptcy. We have case after case where it has happened. All the Durbin amendment says is, if you have to file bankruptcy after this new bankruptcy reform bill were to become law, the bankruptcy system will consider the fact that you have served our Nation by exempting you from certain aspects of this new bill. We will not push you into a means test, but we will consider your individual circumstances.  We will give you a homestead exemption of $75,000 regardless of where you have been assigned for military duty. We will protect your personal assets with the Federal personal exemption regardless of where you have been assigned to duty and where you have to file bankruptcy.  There are those who say this is a special favor for the armed services. It is, and I believe it should be. They risk their lives for us. They should not risk their home and their finances as well. We ought to stand behind them. Yes, you can vote for the Sessions amendment and for the Durbin amendment as well. They are not inconsistent.
