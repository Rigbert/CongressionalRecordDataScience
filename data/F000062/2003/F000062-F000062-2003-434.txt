 President, I rise today to introduce a bill that would allow private, non-profit medical facilities which service industry-specific clients to be eligible for hazard mitigation and disaster assistance. Under the current law, institutions such as these are limited in their ability to receive the Federal funds needed for both preparedness and response in the case of emergencies.  In particular, I speak today of the Motion Picture & Television, MPTF, Hospital, located in the earthquake-prone San Fernando Valley. Set up more than 80 years ago to provide members of the entertainment industry with vital medical care and social services, the MPTF Hospital is the only institution of its kind in the United States.  With an acute care hospital, six outpatient facilities staffed with primary care physicians, a children's center, retirement facilities, and programs for the elderly, the MPTF Hospital provides comprehensive care for a significant sector of the population of the greater Los Angeles community. It is the only non-profit institution providing industry-specific health and human services to the entertainment industry and to the general public.  This legislation is important because in the aftermath of the Northridge Earthquake of 1994, considered one of the worst natural disasters in U.S. history, the MPTF Hospital was unable to receive federal assistance to repair structural and equipment damages suffered from the earthquake. Furthermore, that same year, the California Senate enacted legislation requiring all hospitals to be seismically retrofitted by 2010. The costs of both the reparations and structural upgrades are enormous, and the MPTF Hospital cannot receive federal funds because as an institution serving an industry-specific clientele, it does not qualify under the current definition of a ``private, nonprofit facility'' within the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act of 1988, Stafford Act.  To address this problem, this legislation broadens that definition to include tax-exempt facilities that provide medical services to specific occupational or industry segments of the general public.  Under this change, facilities such as the MPTF Hospital would have the opportunity to apply for federal assistance under the Stafford Act, alongside other private, nonprofit institutions.  There is no up-front cost stemming from this amendment to the Stafford Act. This bill simply puts the MPTF Hospital on equal footing with other critical care facilities when applying for Federal disaster assistance.  This legislation is timely and necessary. Hospitals such as the MPTF deserve an opportunity to apply for Federal funding, and desperately need this financial assistance in order to both meet California's 2010 deadline for seismic retrofitting and respond adequately to future disasters. I call on this body to enact this legislation promptly.                                 ______                                                             By
