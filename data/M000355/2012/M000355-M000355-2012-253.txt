 President, I rise today to pay tribute and bid farewell to a Kentuckian I knew well and considered a good friend. The Honorable Judge James G. Weddle of Casey County, KY, passed away recently, shortly after announcing he would be stepping down from the bench. He was 71.  Judge Weddle had a remarkable legal career that spanned over 45 years; much of it in public service. A graduate of the University of Kentucky School of Law, Judge Weddle served as Casey County Attorney for 16 years, and served as a circuit judge on the 29th Judicial Circuit of Kentucky from 1998 until his untimely passing; he planned to retire in May.  What strikes me the most about Judge Weddle, after having the benefit of his friendship, is how much he valued public service to the people of Casey County and Kentucky. Right up until the end of his career, he was always striving to be better. He felt he had not yet reached his peak. Being the best--and doing the best, for the benefit of all who came into his courtroom was important to him.  A scholarly man, Judge Weddle was sure to read all the latest law books and articles, and often knew more about recent legal events than lawyers in his courtroom who were half his age. He was well known for his ability to cite case after case without having to reference a computer or his law books. Simply put, he loved the law. And he loved the people of his community. You couldn't ask for a finer combination of passions in a Kentucky circuit court judge. The people of the Commonwealth were blessed to have him.  Elaine and I extend our deepest sympathies to the judge's family, especially his wife, Zona; his son, James; his daughters, Lucinda, Suzanne, Andrea, and Sarah; his grandchildren, Jack, Jeb, and Beau; his brother, R.C.; his sister, Delores; and many other friends and family members. The judge was preceded in death by his sister, Norma Jean.  At this time, Mr. President, I would like to ask my Senate colleagues to join me in honoring the memory of the Honorable Judge James G. Weddle. The people of Kentucky are the better for his many years of service.  A newspaper in my home State, the Casey County News, published an excellent article highlighting the Judge's life and career, as well as his obituary. I ask unanimous consent that said materials be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to appear as follows:              [From the Casey County News, Apr. 18, 2012]Judge Weddle Remembered--Circuit Court Judge Dies Days After Announcing                                Retirement                           (By Larry Rowell)       A Casey County native who devoted his life to his family,      the law, and to the people of Casey County has died after an      extended illness.       Casey Circuit Court Judge James G. Weddle died in the early      morning hours of April 11 at home surrounded by family      members. He was 71.       Just a few days before, Weddle had announced that he was      retiring May 1 from the 29th Judicial Circuit, which included      Casey and Adair counties.       Weddle was serving his second eight-year term, having first      been elected in 1998.       Prior to serving as a circuit judge, Weddle became an      attorney in 1966 after graduating from the University of      Kentucky School of Law. He served as Casey County Attorney      for 16 years and also in private practice.       Fellow judges and attorneys had nothing but high praise for      Weddle and a legal career that spanned more than 45 years.       ``I have known Judge Weddle for many years and he was      distinguished by his dedication to his work. No other judge I      know anywhere worked harder with a completeness and constancy      of his work,'' said Chief Justice John Minton of the Kentucky      Supreme Court.       Casey and Adair County Commonwealth's Attorney Brian Wright      prosecuted many cases before Weddle.       ``I had a lot of respect for Judge Weddle, especially for      his legal mind. He devoted his life to the legal      profession,'' Wright said.       Also, Weddle was known for his vast knowledge of legal      cases and his ability to cite cases without ever pulling a      law book off the shelf.       ``He read books, books, and books, and articles on the      Internet. He didn't golf or hunt or fish. His life was the      law,'' Wright said.       Still, Weddle was known for being a fair judge who had an      open mind.       ``It was never his way or the highway when it came to the      law,'' said Janelle ``Tootsie'' Roberts, who served as      Weddle's secretary for 22 years.       Wright said that in one particular case he was trying      before Weddle, he was able to show the judge a prior case      that changed the way he thought about it.       ``He was always open to something new,'' Wright said.       Roberts said that in addition to loving the law, Weddle      also was a history buff who had a knack for remembering dates      and events.       ``Judge Weddle loved history and sometimes in court he      would ask, Today is December 7, can anyone tell me what      happened on that date?''' Roberts said.       And there was another belief that Minton, Wright, and      Roberts shared about Weddle his love for the people of Casey      County.       ``In the last conversation that I had with Judge Weddle      where he told me he was going     to resign, he told me how important his work was to him and      how reluctant he was to give it up. He kept thinking he was      going to get better,'' Minton said.       ``I hate to lose dedicated people like Judge Weddle. It's a      loss to the state and to the counties he served. And, he      loved Casey County,'' Minton said.       A memorial service for Weddle was held on Monday. A      complete obituary can be found on page 4.                     THE HONORABLE JAMES G. WEDDLE       Judge James G. Weddle passed away on Wednesday, April 11,      2012, at his residence. He was born on March 21, 1941, in      Liberty, Kentucky, and was 71.
