Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an organization whose dedication and contributions to the community of Riverside County, California are exceptional. The Riverside-Corona Resource Conservation District (RCRCD) is celebrating its 50 year anniversary on October 25, 2003 and I commend them for the work they have done in the field of conservation.  The Riverside-Corona Resource Conservation District facilitates natural conservation through education, collaboration, and technical assistance. The RCRCD is a small, government agency charged with conserving the natural resources of the area. Some of the projects of the RCRCD include habitat restoration projects including invasive species removal, a severe problem in my district; irrigation water management evaluations; and education programs concerning storm water, trees and soil.  In 1953, 126 local farmers owning 6,700 acres, with the help of Soil Conservation Service staff, sent a petition to the Riverside County Board of Supervisors and requested formation of a ``Soil Conservation District''. That year an election was held and five landowners were nominated as the first directors. By forming the District, federal programs were made available to local farmers.  In the late 1950's, Colorado River water became available to local growers through Western Municipal Water District pipelines. Citrus was planted around Woodcrest, Eagle Valley, Gavilan Hills, Temescal Canyon, and Riverside-Highlands. The RCRCD gained over 400 cooperators. Farmers installed practices to help control erosion, such as cover crops, check dams, grassed waterways and to help conserve water, such as sprinkler systems. The population in the 1950's was about 50,000. Today it is around 500,000.  RCRCD continues to work with local communities and farmers to spread the use of best practices in conservation and for research purposes, such as housing the California Department of Food and Agriculture's research project on the Glassy-winged Sharpshooter, a Pierce's Disease vector.  I salute the Riverside-Corona Resource Conservation District for the work they do in the field of conservation, an area crucial to the future of California. Without researching and educating conservation methods our state will find it hard to sustain the current rate of growth. I commend the 50 years of leadership by RCRCD and thank them for continuing this crucial mission.                          ____________________
