 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by high school students from Peoples Academy in Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people:       Kara: Being an American literature class, we have focused      on writers throughout America's history, and we've focused on      a lot of them. We've pulled some quotes, so as I go along,      Ali's just going to say some of them.       They include Krevocur's ``What Is an American'' (as      Krevokur said, ``We are nothing but what we derive from the      air we breathe, the climate we inhabit, and the nature of our      employment'')-Jefferson's Declaration of Independence;      Kerouac's ``On the     Road'' as well as many other Beat writers; Maya Angelou's      ``On the Pulse of Morning;'' Kingsolver's ``Animal Dreams,''      and many of her essays, short stories and poem; Robert      Prescott Allen's ``Spirit in Nature'' (``People now consume,      control or destroy almost 40% of the plant energy of the      land, and 25% of all plant energy, the ultimate source of      food for all animals, and almost all organisms.''); some of      Thoreau's works and excerpts from them; Scott Russell      Sander's ``Speaking the Word from Nature'' (``Where our      theories of nature have become wiser, our experience of      nature has become shallower.'')       And due to this event, as well as our own interests, we      have looked at many environmental pieces about the EPA, Earth      Day and other similar activities; budget cuts and specific      Acts.       We've looked for connection to environmental issues; we      haven't had to look very far. In a country founded by people      who relied on the land, the environment plays a major role in      our history and literature. It is up to us to make sure      education about the environment gets out, and that's the only      way we can insure that the environment will play a major role      in the future.       Okay, we made murals which are over there, on the wall.      Feel free to go look at them. . .        Yes, do go look at them; we worked hard. They're just      pictures--one's a pool table and one's a tree--but we put all      the quotes from our own work and from all the writers that      we've read that pertain to protecting the environment and      what we're doing to destroy it. And so, they're all there and      please, do go look at them.       As part of some of these writing assignments and readings,      the environment has been a topic of concern. The new budget      plans call for cuts in just about every area. The question      becomes, ``how much are willing to sacrifice from each of      these departments?''       Our world has been misused for so long now that it is      costing immense sums of money to try to clean it up. Can we      really afford not to clean the land up, though? We are      causing the inevitable destruction of ourselves, by      destroying the natural world. The Housing Appropriations Bill      would cut EPA's funding by 34%, prohibiting funding for EPA's      Wetlands, Sewer Overflow, Polluted Runoff and other programs.      The bill also cuts the State's Revolving Fund by $365      million. The State Revolving Fund provides for loans to      cities and counties for sewage treatment plants and other      clean water facilities. This means that, without funding,      communities and cities, like our own, would probably not      receive assistance in addressing public health issues      concerning clean water that we need.       One of the most serious shortcomings recognized by the      Administration are the threats to the Clean Water Act. By      cutting the last $725 million in the Drinking Water State      Revolving Fund, the House eliminates the President's proposed      $1.8 billion investment for safe drinking water. The proposed      bill would sacrifice America's wetland resources by stopping      the President's program that would prohibit the destruction      of them. The new bill would support a multi-billion dollar      fishing and shell-fishing industry (signal) within those      wetlands instead. These cuts can hurt only us.       When the Clean Water Act was established, there were many      goals it had set to make on our lakes and rivers. . . . So      far, we have yet to meet any of these goals. We are still      trying to complete some of them were set to meet in the      eighties. With these proposed budget cuts, the Clean Water      Act will never comes to live up to its potential, and our      lakes and rivers will never be as clean as was hoped. We are      making great progress in this area, as well as others, but      with these cuts in funding, we will have to put these      programs on hold, while the pollution and contamination      continues to occur. Without the funding, there will be no way      to stop the destruction that we, as a nation, have put so      much time and effort into. We implore you to consider these      things when you throw anything away. Become inspired to write      a letter or to do something good and right. Without the      environment intact we are nothing, and as a Cree saying says,      ``If you destroy the land, you destroy the animals; if you      destroy the animals, you destroy the people.'' Thank you.                          ____________________
