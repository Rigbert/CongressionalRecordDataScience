President, I am pleased to introduce legislation today with my colleague, Senator Ron Wyden, to introduce the Improving Access to Clinical Trials Act, I-ACT, a bill to allow patients with rare diseases to participate in clinical drug studies without losing their eligibility for public assistance like Supplemental Security Income, SSI, and Medicaid. This bill provides potentially lifesaving treatments through clinical trials for those suffering with rare diseases, like cystic fibrosis, CF, a life-threatening genetic disease that affects about 30,000 people nationwide. This hits especially close to home for me because I have a staff member, Sage Streck, with CF, and she has participated in some of these trials that further drug research as they seek better treatments for rare diseases. About half of these patients are on Medicare or Medicaid and are eligible for SSI benefits.  Cystic fibrosis used to be primarily a childhood disease because people simply didn't live long enough to reach adulthood. But now, thanks to the many treatments discovered through clinical trials, the average life expectancy is 37 years old. Additionally, these advances in science allow CF patients to live more normal lives and not spend all their lives in hospitals orusing respiratory machines. The more CF patients can participate in clinical trials, the faster scientists can discover new treatments and eventually a cure.  Sage has personally seen in her lifetime five drugs that started in clinical trials and are now available to CF patients. Each medication has increased her quality of life and decreased the amount of time she has spent in the hospital or on IV antibiotics. There are more than 30 promising drugs in the research pipeline right now that the CF Foundation is calling miracle drugs so it is imperative that patients have access to clinical trials so these drugs can get on the market.  Under current law, the small compensation provided to trial participants, which averages around $500, is included as additional income that could cause a person to lose their public assistance benefits, like Supplemental Security Income, SSI, and Medicaid. These benefits are crucial for patients living with rare diseases. For instance, nearly 50 percent of the CF population uses SSI or Medicaid. As a result, patients choose not to enroll in clinical trials that could dramatically improve their lives out of the fear that they may lose the benefits on which they rely.  This bill allows patients with a rare disease to disregard up to $2,000 of compensation received for participation in a clinical trial in their SSI and Medicaid income calculations. Though it will have a negligible impact on the Federal budget, it will make a dramatic difference in the lives of those who will gain access to potentially life-saving treatments by enrolling in clinical trials as well as all those in the future whose lives will be improved by the medical advances that arise from this research.  Please join me in supporting this legislation that will provide patients with rare disease access to potentially lifesaving clinical trials without losing their public assistance health benefits.                          ____________________
