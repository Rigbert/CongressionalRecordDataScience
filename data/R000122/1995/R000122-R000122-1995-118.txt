 Ms. McKINNEY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  The question I want to ask is, why in the world would the Republicans want to revive star wars? They'll use any euphemism to fool the American people, but the bottom line is that among the other foolish ideas presented in this bill, probably the most foolish idea is that we need to knee-jerk ourselves all the way back to star wars.  Aside from totally upsetting all of the arms control agreements that both Democratic and Republican Presidents have been able to hammer out with nuclear nations, this bill might just encourage those missiles that no longer are aimed at us, to make an about face.  The subject matter of national security policy is much too serious to be cooked up by a few pollsters and spinmeisters.  Remember star wars. For the $36 billion already spent did we get our invisible, global, protective shield against missiles? No.  For the $36 billion already spent, did we protect ourselves from terrorist acts like the World Trade Center bombing? No.  And do we really want to go back to space-based ballistic missile defense when there are other critical domestic needs that are tearing at our own social fabric?  It was Dwight D. Eisenhower who said:       Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every      rocket fired, signifies, in the final sense, a theft from      those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are      not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone;      it is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its      scientists, and the hopes of its children.  This group of Republicans that came up with this bill make Dwight D. Eisenhower look like a flaming liberal. The fact of the matter is, however, that:  When we choose star wars over feeding the hungry; and  When we choose star wars over housing the homeless; and  When we choose star wars over even our own children.  We surely make a grave mistake. Let us support the Edwards amendment.
