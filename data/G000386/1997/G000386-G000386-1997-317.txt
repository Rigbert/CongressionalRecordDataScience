 President, I introduce a bill which would reinstate the Medicare-Dependent Hospital Program.  This program expired in October 1994. As its title implied, the hospitals it helped were those which were very dependent on Medicare reimbursement. These were small--100 beds or less--rural hospitals with not less than 60 percent of total discharges or with 60 percent of total inpatient days attributable to Medicare beneficiaries. The program enabled the hospitals in question to choose the most favorable of three reimbursement methods.  The program was extended, and phased out down to October 1994, in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. That act retained the choice of the three original reimbursement methods. But it reduced the reimbursement available from those original computation methods by 50 percent.  My legislation would not extend the program as it was originally enacted by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989. Rather, it would reinstate for 5 years the provisions contained in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. It would not have retroactive effect, however. The program would be revived for fiscal year 1998, and would terminate at the end of fiscal year 2002.  As I noted above, the hospitals which would benefit from this program are small, rural hospitals providing an essential point of access to hospital and hospital-based services in rural areas and small towns. Obviously, if we lose these hospitals, we will also have a hard time keeping physicians in those communities.  Mr. President, 44, or 36 percent, of Iowa's 122 community hospitals qualified to participate in this program in 1994, and 29, or 24 percent, chose to participate. I believe that this was the largest number of such hospitals of any State.  For these hospitals, the percentage of all inpatient days attributable to Medicare patients was 77.4 percent in 1994, and Medicare discharges represented 65.5 percent of total discharges. Across all Iowa hospitals, the Association of Iowa Hospitals and Health Systems indicates that the Medicare share of inpatient days and discharges has increased in recent years, as non-Medicare admissions have dropped. As a result, it is likely that the program will provide a lifeline for even more Iowa hospitals now than in 1994.  The expiration of the program has had a devastating effect on many of these hospitals, including a number with negative operating margins. The bottom line is that many of these hospitals have had, and will have, a very difficult time continuing to exist without the Medicare-Dependent Hospital Program.  Mr. President, I am also going to continue to work for a limited service rural hospital bill. This bill will essentially extend the EACH/RPCH Program--the Essential Access Community Hospital and Rural Primary Care Hospital Program--to all the States.  Taken together, these two pieces of legislation will allow the smaller hospitals in Iowa--and throughout America--to modify their missions in a deliberate and nondisruptive way, and to continue to provide the health care services essential to their communities.                                 ______                                       By
