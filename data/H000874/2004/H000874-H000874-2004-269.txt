Speaker, reclaiming my time, although we have considered them before, you are not sure whether they are going to be in exactly the same form as when they last passed the House last year?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman would yield, ``exactly'' is too stringent a word for me to answer. Exactly, I do not know. I am advised that these two bills have passed the House floor and are substantially the same.
