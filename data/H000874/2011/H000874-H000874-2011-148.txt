 Madam Chair, I rise in support of this legislation.  I am a strong supporter, as many of you know, of what we call our Make It In America agenda. ``Make It In America'' simply means that we're going to provide jobs, we're going to provide opportunities, and we're going to build the manufacturing sector of our economy. In order to do that, we also need to enhance the inventive, innovative, and development phases of our economy. This bill, I think, will facilitate this.  I congratulate the gentlewoman from California for this amendment as well, which I think improves this bill, and I rise in strong support and urge my colleagues to support this piece of legislation. I congratulate all of those who have worked on this legislation.  It is, obviously, not perfect. But then again, no piece of legislation that we adopt is perfect. It is, however, a significant step forward to make sure that America remains the inventive, innovative, development capital of the world. In order to do that, we need to manufacture goods here in America; manufacture the goods that we invent, innovate, and develop. Because if we continue to take them to scale overseas, then the inventors, innovators, and developers will themselves move overseas.  So I thank Mr. Smith, I thank Mr. Watt, and I thank others who have worked so hard on this legislation, Ms. Lofgren as well, who have dedicated themselves to try to make sure that we have a context and environment in America which will facilitate the inventive, innovative sector of our economy.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Speier).  The amendment was agreed to.                  Amendment No. 11 Offered by Mr. Watt  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 11 printed in part B of House Report 112-111.
