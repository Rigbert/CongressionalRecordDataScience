President, I rise to commemorate the 83rd anniversary of the Armenian Genocide.  Old and young around the world today remember the Armenian holocaust. We remember that on this date in 1915, the Ottoman Empire and the successor Turkish nationalist regime began a brutal policy of deportation and murder. Over the next eight years, 1.5 million Armenians would be massacred at the hands of the Turks and another 500,000 would have their property confiscated and be driven from their homeland.  Although it seems that the world stood silent while the Armenian population was devastated, a few witnesses did try to tell the terrible story. In 1919, Henry Morganthau, Sr., the American Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, published a memoir which extensively detailed what he had seen and heard in Turkey during the previous six years. Of the events of the genocide, Ambassador Morgenthau wrote, ``I am confident that the whole history of the human race contains no such horrible episode as this. The great massacres and persecutions of the past seem almost insignificant when compared to the sufferings of the Armenian race in 1915.''  Last August, I had the opportunity to visit Armenia and Nagorno Karabagh. I was able to see the treasures of that land firsthand and pay tribute to the indomitable spirit of the people of Armenia. One morning I toured the Genocide Monument and Museum in Yerevan and then stood by the eternal flame while a vocalist sang a haunting solo. It was the most moving moment of my visit.  My trip to the Transcaucasus made it clear that despite having already undergone such terrible persecution and hardship, the people of the Armenian Republic still suffer today. The economy is struggling and the area has still not recovered from the 1988 earthquake. The Karabagh conflict remains unresolved and Turkey continues to blockade humanitarian aid to Armenia.  However, the Armenian people remain resilient, hopeful, and an inspiration to others. In Armenia, they continue their quest for peace and democracy. Just last month, the residents of Armenia showed their commitment to democracy when they participated in the third presidential election since independence in 1991. In America, many communities, like those in my home state of Rhode Island, are enriched by the traditions of Armenians who have immigrated to our shores.  Because Armenia is a part of our world and persons of Armenian descent are members of our community, we must remain committed to always remember the Armenian genocide. As Peter Balakian, author of the critically acclaimed ``Black Dog of Fate'', wrote:       Commemoration is an essential process for the bereaved and      for the inheritors of the legacy of genocide. It is a process      of making meaning out of unthinkable horror and loss. The      burden of bereavement can be alleviated if shared and      witnessed by a larger community. Only then can redemption,      hope and community be achieved.  Menk panav chenk mornar.                          ____________________
