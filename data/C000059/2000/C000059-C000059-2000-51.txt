 H.R. 4521, as introduced by our colleague, the gentleman from Montana (Mr. Hill), will ensure the future protection of Glacier National Park by laying out a plan to restore the Going-to-the-Sun Road, upgrading utility systems in the park, and the future of the grand lodges in the park. The gentleman from Montana has worked diligently on this legislation and should be commended for his service to Montana and the Congress.  Madam Speaker, this is good legislation that will ensure that future steps taken by Glacier National Park will enhance the ability of the public to access and to enjoy one of America's great parks. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4521, as amended.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
