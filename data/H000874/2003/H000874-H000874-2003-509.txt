Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information.  To press the point, I understand that my colleagues need to work on that and try to work out whatever problems existed, but in light of that, it is the gentleman's expectation he will be able to work out those problems next week so we can pass this bill in a form that will allow us to pass it with the overwhelming support that I think it has on this floor if it is the base bill? I yield to my friend.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding.  I want this bill as much as anybody. It is very, very important, as the gentleman has already stated. It is important to give our military families the tax relief that they deserve, and we want to do this.  I remind the gentleman that this bill, the Military Armed Services Tax Fairness Act, has passed this House almost unanimously twice, and we hope that we can get it up here just as soon as possible. As soon as we get everything ironed out and the bill ripens a little bit, we will bring it to the floor.
