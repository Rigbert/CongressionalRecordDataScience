 President, I send a number of amendments to the desk which have been cleared on each side of aisle.  I ask unanimous consent that these amendments be considered and approved, en bloc, and that accompanying statements be placed at the appropriate place in the Record.  Mr. President, the amendments are as follows: for Senator Grams, to improve the IRS 1-800 help line service; for Senator Faircloth, regarding color printing of tax information; for Senator Levin, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution in support of the U.S. negotiators' position on autos and auto parts with Japan; for Senator Thompson, for the GSA to create a pilot program for States to participate in the FTS 2000 program.
