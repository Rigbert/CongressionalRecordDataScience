Chairman, this is a manager's amendment. It does two things. One, it clarifies the provisions for a GAO report on sales or use taxes for the Spallation Neutron Source, and, secondly, at the request of the Committee on Armed Services, the amendment adds Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos and Sandia National Labs and the Y-12 Plant to the list of labs in the bill excluded from the provision that prohibits citizens of a nation on the DOE's list of sensitive countries from entering any classified area of a federally-owned or operated nonmilitary energy laboratory. This provision was included in the defense authorization bill that was approved earlier today. I know of no controversy on this amendment.
