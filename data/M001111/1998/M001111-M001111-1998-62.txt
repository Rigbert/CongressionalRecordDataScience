I am here to urge my colleagues to join me and others to free America's veterans from the IRS reform legislation. Free the cuts in Veterans Affairs to a genuine and a very public debate.  We are going to have a vote on this issue today. Regardless of whether it is procedural or a straight-up vote, one thing is very clear--it will be a veterans vote. I ask my colleagues to vote with me and with America's veterans.                             point of order  Therefore, Mr. President, I make a point of order that title IX of the conference report is outside the scope of the conference, pursuant to paragraph 2 of rule XXVIII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, which states:       Conferees shall not insert in their report matter not      committed to them by either House. . . .
