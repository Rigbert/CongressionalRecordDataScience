 President, I want the American people to see something. This is the bill the majority would have us pass, this Omnibus appropriations bill. It is 2,000 pages long. I think the American people should think back to this time a year ago--last December--when the Democrats did the very same thing. At that point, it was a 2,700-page health care bill because, frankly, they didn't want us to see what was in it. Only afterwards did we find out about the ``Cornhusker kickback,'' the ``Louisiana purchase,'' and all the rest.  This is eerily familiar to anyone who remembers the health care debate. We even have snow in the forecast, which is reminiscent of last year. Last year we voted on health care in a blizzard--the 2,700-page health care bill in the middle of a blizzard.  This bill is so enormous it took the Government Printing Office 2 days to print it. It spends more than $\1/2\ billion a page. Let's take a look at it again.  Here is the bill. It spends--right at 2,000 pages in this bill--it spends $\1/2\ billion a page. It has more than $\1/2\ billion in it for the Democratic health care bill we passed last year, the 2,700-page bill that looked pretty much like this. It has $\1/2\ billion in it for that health care bill we passed last year.  An ever-growing number of Americans looking at that health care bill would like for us to repeal it, not fund it. This is exactly the kind of thing the American people voted against last November--just this kind of thing. We had a referendum on November 2 on how the American people felt about what we have been doing for the last 2 years, and right at the top of the list was the 2,700-page health care bill.  Frankly, it is just unbelievable. Just a few weeks after the voters told us they don't want us rushing major pieces of complicated, costly, far-reaching legislation through Congress, we get this 2,000-page bill.
