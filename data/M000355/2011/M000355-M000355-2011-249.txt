 President, let me echo the initial remarks of the majority leader with regard to the decision, which in this particular instance I think we would agree is a mutual decision, that we need to stay in every day until we resolve this crisis confronting our country. So I concur with what the majority leader has said. We will stay in every day, Monday through Sunday, and get this problem fixed for our country.
