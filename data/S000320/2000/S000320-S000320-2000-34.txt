 President, the Washington Times reported last week that the Chinese Government-owned news agency, Xinhua, had purchased property on Arlington Ridge Road in Virginia a location that overlooks the Pentagon and has direct line of sight to many of our key Government buildings including this Capitol and the White House.  In fact, the property is so appealing that the East Germans bought it in the early 1980s, which led Congress to amend the Foreign Missions Act.  The Secretary of State, through the Foreign Missions Act, has broad authority to oversee the purchase of buildings in the United States by foreign government entities. Under the Act certain identified governments are required to notify the State Department of their intent to purchase property in the United States. China is one such country.  The Secretary of State then has 60 days to review the sale, and receive input from the Secretary of Defense and the Director of the FBI. She has the option to disapprove the sale during this period.  None of this occurred--despite the fact that China was notified in 1985 that its news agency was required to follow these procedures--and on June 15 the sale was finalized.  The Foreign Missions Act provides the Secretary of State with the authority to remedy this violation of law. Under section 205 of the act, the Secretary may force the news agency to divest itself of the property.  The legislation I am introducing today will ensure that this broad authority is used.  The legislation has two basic requirements: First, it requires the Secretary of State to report to the Intelligence and Foreign Relations Committees whether she intends to force the news agency to divest itself of the property.  Second, the bill prohibits any State Department funds from being used to negotiate with the Chinese on the relocation of the Chinese Embassy in Washington until she certifies that she has instituted divestiture proceedings and will ensure that any further purchase of property by the news agency will be pursuant to the Foreign Missions Act.  By prohibiting funds for further negotiations until this violation of U.S. law is resolved, this second provisionwill also ensure that this issue is handled separately from on-going negotiations to relocate both the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and the Chinese Embassy in Washington, DC.  The potential for this building to be a source of unparalleled espionage is not a theoretical matter. While there is nothing new about PRC spying, as an emerging economic and military power, China increasingly challenges vital U.S. interests around the globe through its aggressive security and intelligence service--employing both traditional intelligence methods as well as non-traditional methods such as open source collection, elicitation, and exploitation of scientific and commercial exchanges.  In December 1999, the Director of Central Intelligence and the Director of the FBI reported to the Intelligence Committee, in unclassified form, that:       As the most advanced military power with respect to      equipment and strategic capabilities, the United States      continues to be the [Military Intelligence Department of the      People's Republic of China]'s primary target.  The DCI went on to report:       During the past 20 years, China has established a notable      intelligence capability in the United States through its      commercial presence.  And added that China's commercial entities play a significant role in pursuit of U.S. proprietary information and trade secrets.  One of China's greatest successes has been its collection against the U.S. nuclear weapons labs. As the U.S. Intelligence Community concluded last year:       China obtained by espionage classified U.S. nuclear weapons      information, [including] at least basic design information on      several modern U.S. nuclear reentry vehicles, including the      Trident II (W88).  The special advisory panel of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board PFIAB concluded:       [T]he nature of the intelligence-gathering methods used by      the People's Republic of China poses a special challenge to      the U.S. in general and the [DOE] weapons labs in particular.      . . . The Chinese services have become very proficient in the      art of seemingly innocuous elicitations of information. This      approach has proved very effective against unwitting and ill-     prepared DOE personnel.  In another example, an investigation by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence concluded that U.S. officials ``failed to take seriously enough the counterintelligence threat'' in launching U.S. satellites on PRC rockets. Technology transfers in the course of U.S.-PRC satellite launches:       Enable the PRC to improve its present and future space      launch vehicle and intercontinental ballistic missile.  But the Chinese are also active in traditional methods of intelligence gathering, which brings us to the subject of my legislation. Especially in the wake of U.S. military success in the Gulf War, the acquisition of advanced U.S. military technology has been a primary thrust of PRC espionage and intelligence collection efforts.  If you want money, and if you are so inclined, you rob a bank because, as a bank robber Willy Sutton famously observed: ``that's where the money is.''  If you want information on the most advanced military power in the world, the Pentagon is where the information is.  I am hopeful that this bill can be taken up and passed quickly by the Senate and the House in order to ensure that the divestiture occurs in an orderly and speedy manner.  Mr. President, this is a serious matter.                                 ______                                       By
