 President, as most Americans know by now, the next few weeks are critically important in the life of our Nation. Unless the President leads and Congress acts, the combination of automatic tax hikes and spending cuts will go into effect that could have a devastating effect on our national defense and on an already painfully slow economy.  What is more, the Nation's finances are teetering on the edge, threatening even greater hardship for literally millions unless we bring Federal spending into balance. The question is, What are we going to do about all of this? How do we face up to the fiscal irresponsibility and can kicking that got us here and finally do what is right for the country?  I do not think it is a secret that for our part the Republicans have shown a clear willingness to make tough choices in order to find a solution to the trillion-dollar deficits of the last 4 years. We have been open to revenue by closing loopholes, as long as it is tied to spending cuts and progrowth tax reform that broadens the base and lowers rates.  This is the model laid out by the Bowles-Simpson Commission, and it is a model both parties should step forward and embrace. Without compromising our principles, we have put skin in the game and recognition of that while Democrats do not run this town, neither do we. We have been responsible even as we have remained firm on this point: No tax increases now for promised spending cuts that will not materialize later. The American people have seen that game before and they will not be fooled again.  The only balanced approach is one that includes real and lasting reforms. So Republicans have stepped out of our comfort zone. We have been clear about what we will do and what we will not. Yet we remain at an impasse, leading us to ask why. Because a vocal minority on the hard left continues to argue to leaders of their party, from the President on down, that Democrats in Washington should do absolutely nothing about short-term or long-term spending problems.  This is the ``Thelma and Louise'' crowd, the ones who dream about higher taxes and the bigger government it will pay for, regardless of the impact on jobs or the economy or America's standing in the world. These are the ones who recklessly ignore the fact that we cannot continue running trillion-dollar deficits every year and throw a tantrum if somebody suggests that maybe the taxpayers should not keep subsidizing every last program Washington ever dreamed up.  Their reckless and ideological approach threatens our very future. Anyone who is serious about solving the problems we face should ignore all that, starting with the President. The election is over, but the economy and fiscal problems of the past several years have only gotten worse. It is time for the President to present a plan that rises above these reckless and radical voices on the hard left, that goes beyond the talking points of the campaign trail, and that has a realistic chance of passing the Congress. The time, in other words, for campaigning is over. It is time for the President to lead.  A little over 1 week ago, I attended a meeting with the President down at the White House. It was positive and productive and afterward I was confident that all sides were eager to figure out a solution to the present challenges that respects our respective principles. But as I have said repeatedly, the only person in America who can make or break it is the President himself.  He is the only one who can lead his party to do something they would not ordinarily do, to do what is actually needed now. That is why he is the one who has to present a plan for success. So we will continue to wait on the President and hope he has what it takes to bring people together and forge a compromise. If he does, we will get there. If he does not, we will not. It is that simple.                          ____________________
