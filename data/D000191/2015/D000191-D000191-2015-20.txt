Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Generally, the gentleman from California and I have worked together on a number of things, and this is one time when I reluctantly rise in opposition to his proposal.  I have spent a good deal of time on aggregate issues in my own district that relate to those which are located in the marine environment, and I understand some of the frustrations and concerns that go on there. The language in this, though, is so broad that we are preempting both the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and the Truman-Hobbs Act, which relate to impediments to navigation.  At this point, that sort of amendment would, for instance, overturn an easement that has been entered into between the joint Naval Base Kitsap and the owners of this aggregate. There is a concern that, if a dock were built in that area, it would interfere with the navigation that is a prime route for our strategic submarine forces in the Pacific Northwest and the Pacific region.                              {time}  1515  So we think it has unintended consequences that go far beyond any idea of streamlining access to maritime aggregate resources.  So I would have to recommend Members oppose the amendment.  I reserve the balance of my time.
