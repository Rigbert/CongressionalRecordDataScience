 It has been a pleasure for me to work with him.  Let me once again sum up, because I know the distinguished Senator from Maine is waiting, and I do want to thank the Senator from Utah for his leadership not only of the Judiciary Committee but in what we have been working on. I hope if people might be interested they would let us know.  In the meantime, I am really not prepared, based on the analytical data--and we have tried to get every single piece we could--to cast a vote which has repercussions for a quarter of a century and which would have repercussions on a State where 5 million people smoke and almost a million youngsters and one out of every four high school seniors is addicted to nicotine. Until I have some of these answers and we know what the impact on the streets in Los Angeles, in San Francisco, in Fresno, in San Diego, is going to be 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, and 25 years hence--then we can cast an informed vote, and then we can go home and say we really have done something good for the people we represent.  I thank the Chair. I apologize and I thank the Senator from Maine for her forbearance.  I yield the floor.
