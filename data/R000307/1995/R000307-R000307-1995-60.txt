 Mr. Chairman, I know that the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Miller] and some of his other colleagues have serious concerns about the sugar program, as well as other farm programs. I want to assure him, as I have assured the gentleman from New Mexico and the gentlewoman from New York, that the Committee on Agriculture plans to pursue a market-oriented policy to this program.  It is my hope that we can come to an agreement on policy changes that all Members of this body will be happy with and that we can avoid a protracted floor fight at the time of the farm bill.  With that in mind, I would ask the gentleman, as I have asked the other Members of this body, to withdraw his amendment and permit the authorizing committee to address these issues.
