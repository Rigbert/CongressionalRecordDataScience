Speaker, this long weekend millions of children will have a day off from school--and many of their parents will have a day off from work.  How many children, and how many of their parents will pause over this long weekend to reflect on the two great Presidents whose birthdays we will celebrate?  George Washington translated a fragile, untested document--our Constitution--into a working system of government in which no branch appropriated unto itself powers beyond what the framers of our Constitution envisaged.  Where George Washington could easily have chosen to be a monarch or a despot unaccountable to no one but himself, he, instead, devoted his twin terms as President to putting into practice the ideals of the American Revolution.  President Washington never lost sight of a basic tenant of the Revolution that Government's power ultimately resides in the people, and that public officials are the servants of the public.  Assuming office at a time of great peril and uncertainty, President Washington returned to Mount Vernon eight years later having proven through his example of restraint and leadership that the great American experiment had succeeded.  But unfortunately, seven decades later, our country was wracked by division, anger and, eventually, a bitter civil war. The American experiment was suddenly imperiled.  At times of great crisis, the American people have had the genius of entrusting the Nation's fate to great leaders.  Abraham Lincoln, by navigating our country through the crucible of civil war, preserved the nation and extended Washington's vision of the American experiment. By bringing those previously enslaved under the protection of the Constitution and Bill of Rights, Lincoln promoted the concept that for democratic government to truly succeed, all Americans must be able to participate. Just last week we underscored the significance of full citizen participation by commemorating the 35th anniversary of the ratification of the 24th Amendment to the Constitution, which finally put an end to the poll tax.  President Lincoln himself so eloquently described the American experiment as a ``government of the people, by the people, for the people''.  On this holiday weekend, I urge all Americans to reflect on the wisdom, courage and leadership of Presidents Washington and Lincoln.                          ____________________
