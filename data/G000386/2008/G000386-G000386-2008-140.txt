 President, the Smithsonian Institution is an important icon to many Americans. It houses treasures of our national history in its museums across the country. The Smithsonian Institution is not just a museum but also an educational institution and a research complex. It consists of 19 museums and galleries, 9 research facilities, and has 144 affiliated museums around the world. The Smithsonian manages this vast array of facilities and receives 70 percent of its funding directly from the federal government through congressional appropriations. There is no debate that the Smithsonian is an important part of our country.  However, over the last few years I have been critical of the managementof the Smithsonian Institution, beginning with story after story detailing the ``Champagne lifestyle'' the former Secretary of the Smithsonian enjoyed at institution expense. Through my oversight of the Smithsonian as a tax-exempt entity, and investigative reporting by the Washington Post, other egregious examples have emerged. These revelations have detailed the Smithsonian's management failures and lax accountability over the spending of millions of institution dollars.  The former secretary spent millions of institution dollars on the redecoration of his office, housing allowances, and household expenses including chandelier cleaning and a new heater pump for his lap pool. He and his wife enjoyed first-class plane travel and top hotels.  Ultimately, Secretary Small resigned on March 26, 2007.  The deputy secretary and chief operating officer of the Smithsonian Institution, announced her resignation on June 18, 2007, after earning more than $1.2 million in 6 years for outside duties, including highly compensated seats on corporate boards, and that she and other top executives were frequently absent from their Smithsonian duties.  An independent management report released in June 2007 concluded that Smithsonian leaders took extraordinary measures to keep secret top executives' compensation, expense-account spending, ethical missteps, and management failures.  In August 2007, the Smithsonian replaced Gary M. Beer as chief executive of Smithsonian Business Ventures after an inspector general's report found he had abused his institution-issued credit card and billed thousands of dollars in expenditures that were unauthorized or lacked evidence of a business purpose.  In December 2007, W. Richard West, Jr., who was the founding director of the National Museum of the American Indian, retired after disclosures that he spent extensive time away from the museum and spent more than $250,000 in 4 years on trips to places including Paris, Venice, Singapore, and Indonesia.  In February 2008, Pilar O'Leary, the head of the Smithsonian Latino Center, resigned after an internal investigation found that she violated a variety of rules and ethics policies by abusing her expense account, trying to steer a contract to a friend and soliciting free tickets for fashion shows, concerts, and music award ceremonies. Ultimately, the Smithsonian Inspector General concluded that there were 14 violations of ethical and conflict of interest policies. The public did not learn of the reason for her resignation until April 15, 2008, when the Washington Post published a story after requesting under the Freedom of Information Act and ultimately receiving a heavily redacted copy of the Smithsonian Inspector General's report on Ms. O'Leary.  When Ms. O'Leary's resignation was announced to Smithsonian staff, the Smithsonian's official e-mail did not mention ethical lapses and in fact praised her work.  Only upon the specter of public disclosure did the Smithsonian's acting secretary say in a second e-mail to staff that O'Leary had ``engaged in behavior that violated our Standards of Conduct and other Smithsonian policies between August 2005 and September 2007.''  The acting secretary at the time said such reports from the Inspector General were not always public, but Smithsonian officials determined O'Leary ``held a position of such significant responsibility and public visibility that disclosure . . . was warranted.''  This raises a series of disturbing questions. What if a Post reporter had not somehow learned of the O'Leary report and formally asked the Smithsonian for a copy? Would the circumstances of Ms. O'Leary's resignation ever have seen the light of day? Once the report was released in a redacted form, was it appropriately redacted or was it redacted beyond what is reasonable to protect the privacy of third parties? Does the Smithsonian withhold other potentially embarrassing reports? If the individual had not been the head of a Smithsonian agency, and had a lower stature, would the report ever have been disclosed in any form?  If the past is prologue, probably not. The Smithsonian points out that it is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA.  Many people would naturally think that the Smithsonian is subject to FOIA and must comply with requests. I know that I believed it was, especially given that taxpayer funds make up 70 percent of its budget. However, because the creation of the Smithsonian was different than the creation of other Federal Government agencies, there is an open question as to what open government and good governance statutes apply to the Smithsonian. For example, the Smithsonian's own website states, ``The Smithsonian Institution is not an executive branch agency and is not required by statute to provide documents to the public.'' However, the Smithsonian does state that it is guided by ``internal policy, and by FOIA and other relevant law'' when providing documents to the public. What this highly technical answer means is that the Smithsonian doesn't believe it is required to respond under FOIA but it will as long as its interests are in line with the release.  The legal status of the Smithsonian is also an open question with the prevailing law finding that for purposes of the Privacy Act and FOIA, the Smithsonian is not a government ``agency'' subject to the requirements. Instead, the Smithsonian calls itself a ``trust instrumentality of the United States.'' However, the Smithsonian takes a different position when it is faced with a lawsuit filed under the Federal Tort Claims Act and considers itself a ``federal agency.'' Taken together, these decisions have given the Smithsonian the best of both worlds--they are a government entity when information is sought that could embarrass them, but when they are sued, they get all the defenses of a government entity.  In light of the oversight findings and the many scandals that have raised questions about accountability and mismanagement at the Smithsonian, I'm introducing the Open and Transparent Smithsonian Act of 2008. This bill simply states that for the purposes of FOIA, the Privacy Act, and the Federal Advisory Committee Act, the Smithsonian shall be considered a Federal Government agency. This is a simple, straightforward way to bring transparency and accountability to the Smithsonian without expending additional Federal resources. This is especially important given that the Smithsonian received continual increases in congressional appropriations from fiscal years 1999-2008, now totaling $682 million in taxpayer dollars for fiscal year 2008.  On July 1, Wayne Clough took over as only the 12th secretary in Smithsonian history. He comes at a critical juncture. Will the Smithsonian recover from a series of scandals and regain its sterling reputation? Or will it backslide into bad old habits that could lead to more scandals?  The new secretary deserves the best possible chance to succeed. One of the best tools Congress can give him is a clear, definitive statement through legislative action that the Freedom of Information Act does indeed apply to the Institution, and that the Smithsonian's business is the people's business.  In addition to adding the Smithsonian to FOIA and Privacy Act, section 3 of this bill includes another important transparency fix to the Privacy Act. Currently, the Privacy Act provides that disclosure of information by a government agency is limited unless an enumerated exception applies. One of the most widely used exceptions allows for the disclosure of information to ``either House of Congress, or, to the extent of matter within its jurisdiction, any committee or subcommittee thereof.'' However, the Department of Justice has interpreted this to only allow for disclosures to chairmen of committees, excluding information from ranking minority members.  In a December 2001 letter opinion, the Department of Justice concluded, ``the Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of Privacy Act-protected information to the ranking minority member.'' The rationale for this decision was that longstanding executive branch practice on this question shows that ``ranking minority members are not authorized to make committee requests.'' This opinion clearly looks past the plain language of the statute that says that the exception applies to ``either Houseof Congress or to the extent of matter within its jurisdiction, any committee or subcommittee thereof.'' This interpretation clearly bypasses the inclusion of the word ``or'' and instead reads that Congress only intended it to apply to committee chairman. Conveniently, this opinion has been repeatedly used to block information requested from ranking members.  Section 3 of the bill corrects this erroneous interpretation by clearly adding in that chairman and ranking members may qualify for the exception under the Privacy Act. This provision is consistent with the intent of the Privacy Act exception and the goals of making the government more transparent and accountable under good governance statutes.  This bill is a simple, straightforward effort to make our Federal Government more accountable to the American taxpayers. Further, it will help ensure that Congress has the necessary access to documents from the executive branch so it can conduct its constitutionally required duty of oversight. I am pleased that Senator Specter has joined as an original cosponsor and urge my colleagues to support swift passage of this important legislation.                          ____________________
