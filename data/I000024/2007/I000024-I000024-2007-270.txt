1082 requiring parental consent for intrusive physical exams administered under the Head Start Program. Young children attending Head Start Programs should not be subjected to these intrusive types of physical exams. We had an incident in my town of Tulsa, OK, where we felt that their rights, children's rights, were violated. They were subjected to different types of intrusive examinations. I will be bringing this up at an appropriate time.  Secondly, briefly, as I see the manager of the bill is here, we will be introducing an amendment No. 988, having to do with protecting children from parents being coerced into administering a controlled substance or psychotropic drug in order to attend school.  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
