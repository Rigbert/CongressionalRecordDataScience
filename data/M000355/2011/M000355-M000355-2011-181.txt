 Ira Jackson Cornett. Ira--known to his friends as ``Red''--celebrated his 95th birthday September 12 and is the proud founder and owner of the internationally known engine rebuilding firm, Cornett Machine Shop. Red is extremely proud of his God-given ability to rebuild all types of engines and claims if you can break it, then he can certainly fix it.  Red was born in London, KY, and moved to Oregon with his family when he was young. He later returned to Somerset where in 1948, he bought land and established Cornett Machine Shop, which specializes in the rebuilding of racing engines from all over the world. Over the years, Red's unique skills have been crucial to his success and helped him gain international recognition. Red once sold an engine to Tiger Woods' caddy and shipped it to New Zealand. Another time, Red had the opportunity to rebuild a V-12 airplane engine like the one flown by Eddie Rickenbacker, a famous American fighter ace in World War I. Currently, Cornett Machine Shop is rebuilding a Jones car that was made in Kansas in 1917--a car he feels very few these days realize were ever made.  Red's Cornett Machine Shop has been a successful and reputable business for decades. Now located on a hilltop on the west side of south U.S. 27, the business is still running full tilt and Red has faith the tradition will continue as he has passed along his talents to his sons, David and Jack. However, until then, Red says he plans to keep on going, as he still has a lot of work to do.  Mr. Ira Jackson ``Red'' Cornett continues to exemplify the character and success that define generation after generation of Kentuckians; I ask unanimous consent that a recent article published in Kentucky's Pulaski County-area Commonwealth Journal that highlights Red's lifelong achievements be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Commonwealth Journal, Sept. 22, 2011]             Red Cornett: Engine Builder Going Strong at 95                   (By Bill Mardis, Editor Emeritus)       ``The Lord gave everybody a talent to make a living and a      person ought to enjoy doing it.''       Ira Jackson Cornett--his friends and everybody call him      ``Red''--has been using his God-given talent longer than most      people live. He passed his 95th birthday September 12. That's      correct. He has been living for nine decades and a half and      just keeps on going. ``Red'' Cornett shows up for work every      day at his beloved Cornett Machine Shop.       ``I go home for lunch,'' Cornett reflected. His wife, Mary      Elizabeth, is in poor health and he goes home to see about      her. They've been married 70 years.       ``I've still got a lot of work to do,'' said Cornett,      grinning and guiding his power chair among sophisticated      machinery in the sprawling Cornett Machine Shop on South U.S.      27.       Cornett loves to talk about his business. He relaxes in his      chair, stopping a moment as he and a visitor toured the      plant.       Someone spoke, calling him ``Red.'' He rubbed a hand      through a headful of gray hair. ``My hair used to be bright      red,'' he laughed. ``My whiskers still are . . . and they're      thick too.''       Cornett Machine Shop is his baby. He loves it. It is part      of his life. The internationally known engine rebuilding firm      rebuilds engines, all kinds of engines; racing engines;      engines from all over the world. ``Red'' Cornett knows how it      works.       ``The Lord gave me a talent . . . if you can break it I can      fix it,'' said Cornett. ``If nobody else wants to tackle it,      I'll do it.'' He has passed his talents along to son, David,      who manages the machine shop, and to Jack, who is in charge      of the Racing Division.       ``We sold (golfer) Tiger Woods' caddy an engine last      week,'' noted Cornett. ``We shipped it to New Zealand. We      sent an engine to Bend, Oregon, yesterday.''       Recently, Cornett Machine Shop rebuilt a V-12 airplane      engine like the one flown by Eddie Rickenbacker, an American      fighter ace in World War I. ``We built parts for it,''      Cornett said.       Cornett Machine Shop currently is rebuilding a Jones car      made in Kansas in 1917.       ``Very few people know there was a Jones car,'' Cornett      laughed. ``They were making them back in 1902 and 1903.''      Nearby was a flathead Ford engine circa 1939-40.       Currently, Cornett Machine Shop has 16 employees. ``One      fellow has been here for 55 years,'' Cornett said. ``At one      time I had about 30 employees,'' he related. Each employee      has his own private air-conditioned room in which to work.       Age has not tempered Cornett's strong opinions. ``Young      people don't have the same work ethics we have,'' he      declared. ``They don't love their work like we do.''       Cornett didn't reveal his political persuasion, but he      isn't too impressed with the current administration in      Washington. ``Obama sure has been a disappointment,'' he      offered.       About the economy, Cornett has an unusual perspective.      ``Things are no higher than they ever were. Money is junk . .      . it's getting more worthless.''       ``I started out on my own in 1948,'' he recalls. His first      machine shop was located on South Main Street. `` . . . The      telephone company and me were in the same block,'' he said.       Next, Cornett Machine Shop moved to U.S. 27 where the      Tradewind shopping center is now located. ``(U.S. 27) was a      single lane (each way) then,'' he remembers. ``Finley's      (Drive-in) was the next thing that built out there.''       ``I bought that lot (Tradewind location) for $2,000,''      Cornett remembers. ``I went to Pope Walker at First and      Farmers Bank and he told me I could borrow all the money I      needed.'' Cornett Machine Shop has since located on a hilltop      farther south on the west side of U.S. 27, now a six-lane      boulevard.       Cornett was born in nearby London but his family moved to      Oregon. They later returned to Somerset.       ``I worked for the forest service in Idaho for $7.50 an      hour,'' Cornett recalls. His love for the outdoors has      lingered throughout his life. His hobbies are shooting, and      big-game hunting. ``I've killed moose, elk, deer, antelope      and millions of prairie dogs in South Dakota and Montana.''       In addition to David and Jack, the Cornett's have two      daughters, Mary Ann Bingham who lives in Alabama, and Arlene      Warner of Somerset.       Cornett is not letting 95 years stand in his way. ``I plan      to keep on going. That's my talent; that's what God said for      me to do. If you enjoy it, why not?''                          ____________________
