President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators Daschle, Smith of Oregon, Baucus, Burns, Johnson, and Craig, in introducing legislation making an important adjustment to the way the Government manages rights-of-way over federal lands. The provisions in this bill address the situation involving liability standards for electric utilities that utilize federal rights-of-ways to provide electricity to rural communities.  I am pleased to be working on this issue with my good friends and colleagues from Oregon, Bob Smith and Peter DeFazio. Chairman Smith has introduced similar legislation in the House of Representatives, which received a hearing in the House Resources Committee earlier this year. During that hearing, one of my constituents, Mr. Bill Kopacz of Midstate Electric in LaPine, Oregon testified on the need to reform the current federal policy of requiring strict liability for fires that occur in right-of-ways.  Under strict liability, the holder of a right of way is responsible for all injury, loss, or damage, including fire suppression costs, caused by the holder of the right of way without regard to the holder's negligence.  The problem that this legislation addresses is best illustrated by the experience of the Midstate Electric Cooperative of LaPine, Oregon.  As a matter of prudent maintenance, Midstate trims or removes trees on right-of-ways that pose a risk of falling onto electric lines. On federal rights-of-way, the cooperative consults with the appropriate land management agency--which of course must approve these management actions. After proposing the removal of a number of trees on a Forest Service right-of-way in 1984, Midstate was told by the agency that it could cut some down, but had to leave other specified trees standing. Of course the predictable happened--one of the trees that Midstate had proposed cutting, which the Forest Service had refused to allow to be removed, fell into a power line and started a fire.  In the end it cost more than $326,850 to put that fire out--and Midstate Electric got the bill. Since the fire resulted from a management decision of the Forest Service, Midstate went to court in an attempt to appropriately assign the financial liability of fighting the fire. Midstate lost the court action because of a ruling which interpreted right-of-way contracts as holding the co-op and other right-of-way lessees to a strict liability standard.  The 1976 Federal Land Policy and Management Act provided federal agencies with the authority to impose strict liability for costs associated with hazards on federal lands. Prior to 1976, agencies recovered costs associated with hazards, such as costs required to put out a fire, on the basis of normal negligence.  This bill would replace that strict liability standard in favor of a normal negligence standard that is routinely used in private right-of-way contracts. The new standard will say: if you caused it, you are responsible for it. Rural electric cooperatives, investor-owned utilities and municipalities are not looking to pass the buck to the American taxpayer. If they are negligent in maintaining federal rights-of-way, they should bear the responsibility. However, by enforcing any standard more rigid than that, the land management agencies are purposefully transferring cost to private citizens.  The minimum impact of the current strict liability policy is higher electric rates for those rural communities who live in close proximity to public lands. The possibility exists, however, of even more punitive impacts in the form of the loss of insurance coverage for entities with federal rights-of-way liability.  In my judgement, this legislation restores an appropriate balance to the shared responsibility of both the land manager and the utility in reducing the natural hazards along a right ofway. As we saw in the Midstate case, because the Forest Service bears no exposure to costs associated with fire and risk prevention, the Forest Service simply did not allow the full use of measures to reduce those risks.  This legislation will not only benefit the state of Oregon. Utilities all through the United States have rights-of-way permits with our land management agencies. This proposal is of interest in states such as California, Idaho, Florida, Minnesota, Montana, Wyoming and Pennsylvania. I believe my proposal is fair and balanced legislation that protects our rural communities. I look forward to working with my colleagues and the Administration to perfect this legislation in the waning days of the 105th Congress.                                 ______                                       By
