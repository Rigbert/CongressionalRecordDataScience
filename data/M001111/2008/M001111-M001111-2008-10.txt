 I appreciate the Senator's work on skills-training issues, and I am proud to cosponsor his legislation entitled, ``Strengthening Employment Clusters to Organize Regional Success--SECTORS--Act.'' Partnerships organized by industry sectors are an effective strategy to connect workers with thriving industries such as health care, emerging and transitioning industries like the energy industry, and manufacturing, which are vital to both the Ohio and Washington State economies. The strategies of both Promoting Innovations to 21st Century Careers Act and SECTORS Act are effective because they bring together the key stakeholders, including business, labor organizations, education at various levels, workforce boards, economic development entities, and other community organizations.
