Chairman, I have gone back and looked at the votes that I have cast in previous years for the legislative appropriations bill. My votes have always been ``no.'' This is the first time, in fact, that I expect to vote ``yes.''  The reason is this: In each of those years, spending under this subcommittee has gone up. This year it is different; spending goes down. In fact, spending goes down about 8 percent. I think that is a pretty good figure, particularly as we look at years and years ahead of us of multi-$100-billion deficits.  In fact, if we had an 8-percent cut in each of the appropriation bills, we would save the taxpayers about $130 billion just in fiscal year 1996. That is not bad. In fact, that is exactly the direction that we need to be headed.  Mr. Chairman, in this year of massive budget cuts, it is only fair that this subcommittee, the legislative branch, takes its fair share of cuts, and I applaud the committee for doing this.
