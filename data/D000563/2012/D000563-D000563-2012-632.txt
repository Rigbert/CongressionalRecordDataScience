We have been working on it together.                               Exhibit 1                                                  U.S. Senate,                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 2012.     Hon. Leon R. Panetta,     Secretary of Defense,     Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary Panetta: We write to express our grave      concern regarding the Department of Defense's ongoing      business dealings with Rosoboronexport, the same Russian      state-controlled arms export firm that continues to provide      the Syrian government with the means to perpetrate widespread      and systematic attacks on its own people. According to the      United Nations, over 7,500 Syrian civilians have reportedly      been killed in the attacks by the desperate regime of     Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and we continue to receive      grisly accounts that his government forces are summarily      executing, imprisoning, and torturing demonstrators and      innocent by-standers.       Russia remains the top supplier of weapons to Syria,      selling reportedly $1 billion or more worth of arms to Syria      in 2011 alone. Its arms shipments to Syria have continued      unabated during the ongoing popular uprising there. According      to Thomson Reuters shipping data, since December 2011, at      least four cargo ships have travelled from the Russian port      used by Rosoboronexport to the Syrian port of Tutus. Another      Russian ship that was reportedly carrying ammunition and      sniper rifles, weapons which Syrian forces have used to kill      and injure demonstrators, reportedly docked in Cyprus in      January and then went on to deliver its cargo directly to      Syria. In addition, recent reports from human rights      monitoring organizations confirm that Russian weapons such as      240mm F 864 high explosive mortars have been found at the      site of ongoing atrocities committed against civilians in      Homs, Syria. In January of this year, Rosoboronexport      reportedly signed a new deal with the Syrian government for      36 combat jets.       Even in the face of crimes against humanity committed by      the Syrian government during the past year, enabled no doubt      by the regular flow of weapons from Russia, the United States      Government has unfortunately continued to procure from      Rosoboronexport. It is our understanding that the DoD,      through an initiative led by the U.S. Army, is currently      buying approximately 21 dual-use Mi 17 helicopters for the      Afghan military from Rosoboronexport. This includes the      signing of a no-bid contract worth $375 million for the      purchase of aircraft and spare parts, to be completed by      2016. Media reports indicate that the contract included an      option for $550 million in additional purchases, raising the      contract's potential total to nearly $1 billion.       While it is certainly frustrating that U.S. taxpayer      funding is used to buy Russian-made helicopters instead of      world-class U.S.-made helicopters for the Afghan military,      our specific concern at this time is that the Department is      procuring these assets from an organization that had for      years been on a U.S. sanctions list for illicit nuclear      assistance to Iran and in the face of the international      community's concern is continuing to enable the Assad regime      with the arms it needs to slaughter innocent men, women, and      children in Syria. Other options are very Rely available as      demonstrated by the fact that the first four Mi 17      helicopters that the U.S. Navy purchased for Afghanistan came      through a different firm. We ask that the DoD immediately      review all potential options to procure helicopters legally      through other means.       U.S. taxpayers should not be put in a position where they      are indirectly subsidizing the mass murder of Syrian      civilians. The sizeable proceeds of these DoD contracts are      helping to finance a firm that is essentially complicit in      mass atrocities in Syria, especially in light of Russia's      history of forgiving huge amounts of Syria's debt on arms      sales, as occurred in 2005 during President Assad's state      visit to Moscow.       President Obama has called on President Assad to step down,      and he has declared that ``Preventing mass atrocities and      genocide is a core national security interest and a core      moral responsibility of the United States.'' As such, we urge      you to use all available leverage to press Russia and Russian      entities to end their support of the Assad regime, and that      includes ending all DoD business dealings with      Rosoboronexport, which is within your authority as Secretary      of Defense. Continuing this robust business relationship with      Rosoboronexport would undermine U.S. policy on Syria and      undermine U.S. efforts to stand with the Syrian people.       This is a serious policy problem, and we ask for your      personal attention to help solve it Thank you for your      service to our nation and your dedication to the members of      our Armed Forces.           Sincerely,         John Cornyn; Kirsten E. Gillibrand; Richard J. Durbin;            Kelly Ayotte; Richard Blumenthal; James E. Risch; David            Vitter; Sherrod Brown; Chuck Grassley; Marco Rubio; Jon            Kyl; Robert Menendez; Roger F. Wicker; Robert P. Casey,            Jr.; Mark Kirk; Ron Wyden; Benjamin L.
