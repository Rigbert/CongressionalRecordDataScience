President, Senator Dodd is the Democratic technology leader. I join him now in saying that a vote against this bill is a vote against the entrepreneurs and risk-takers of this Nation who are working their heads off to make their systems Y2K compliant but are legitimately fearful of frivolous lawsuits.  Some have said that small businesses cannot recover their economic losses under this bill. If that were the case, why would the Nation's small businesses overwhelmingly support the legislation?  The fact is, small businesses can recover economic losses just as they do under the status quo. Specifically, a small business plaintiff can recover whatever economic losses are allowed under State contract law. Many of these State laws say that if profits are lost as a consequence of a Y2K failure, the small business plaintiff can recover their economic losses.  Failure to pass this bill would be similar to lobbing a monkey wrench into the high-tech engine that is driving the Nation's economic prosperity. I join with Senator Dodd, our technology leader, in urging Democrats to support the legislation.
