  I was lucky to know Mayer for many years. He was a successful businessman from Alabama, a philanthropist who supported groundbreaking cancer research and a strong voice here in the Halls of Congress. An advocate for a strong friendship between the United States and Israel, Mayer served a term as president of the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee, AIPAC, and he impressed all who met him with his clear and passionate convictions.  I had the honor of attending Mayer's memorial service last month, in the USA Mitchell Center at the University of South Alabama in Mobile, AL. I heard many moving tributes from many distinguished guests. But there was one that stood out to me above the rest, so much so that I wish to share it with my fellow Senators.  My good friend Howard Kohr, the executive director of AIPAC, delivered the following remarks at Mayer's memorial service. Howard so aptly described the man we had all come to know and love that I would like to ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record his words.
