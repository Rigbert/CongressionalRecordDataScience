Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), the majority leader.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Maryland's words, but I look at it a little differently. After reading all the records and everything, what I do know is that there is a mother, a father, a brother, and a sister that want Terri Schiavo to live, and they want to take care of her.  I want to thank everybody that has worked on this bill, particularly those in the Senate, the Democrats in the Senate, the Republicans in the Senate. They passed this bill unanimously. I want to thank the Democrats in this House that worked on this bill, the Republicans that worked on this bill. Some have tried to make it a partisan issue.  Mr. Speaker, after 4 days of words, the best of them uttered in prayer, now comes the time for action. I say again, the legal and political issues may be complicated, but the moral ones are not. A young woman in Florida is being dehydrated and starved to death. For 58 long hours, her mouth has been parched and her hunger pangs have been throbbing. If we do not act, she will die of thirst. However helpless, Mr. Speaker, she is alive. She is still one of us. And this cannot stand.  Terri Schiavo has survived her Passion weekend, and she has not been forsaken. No more words, Mr. Speaker. She is waiting. The Members are here. The hour has come.  Mr. Speaker, call the vote.
