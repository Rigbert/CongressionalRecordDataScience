 I had the word of the Senate majority whip that I was going to be able to bring my amendment up right after the Durbin amendment this morning after 11:30. It seems to me, if I have the word of a fellow Senator that I have a chance to bring my amendment up, I don't even have to be included in a unanimous consent. If you want to nail it down that way, nail it down; it is OK with me. But it seems to me I was told by the majority leader that I was going to be able to bring my amendment up, and that word is better than anything else that can go on in this body.
