Speaker, I am pleased to take this opportunity today to recognize the contributions to Catholic education made by Sister Janet Doyle, O.P. of the Toledo Catholic Diocese. Sr. Janet leaves her position as Superintendent of the diocese's Catholic Youth and Social Services, having developed the office into a comprehensive network of services for young people including schools, sports, social activities, and ministry.  During her long tenure, Sr. Janet has overseen 83 elementary schools, 10 high schools, 4 private high schools, and 2 colleges in the diocese's nineteen county Northwest Ohio area through which tens of thousands of children have been educated. Under her leadership, the schools expanded enrollment to include children of all faiths, offering opportunities for them to learn in an interfaith environment.  Sr. Janet's stewardship has been marked by the Catholic educators' credo that ``we believe our Catholic School is not only a school, but a community of Faith; we believe those entrusted to us are not only students, but children of God; we believe we are not only educators, but ministers of the Gospel; we believe the values we teach are not only character development, but a call to Holiness; we believe our courses of study are not only academic pursuits, but a search for Truth; we believe the purpose of education is not only for personal gain and the development of society, but for the Transformation of the world.'' Under her capable guidance, the diocese's schools have demonstrated they are at the forefront of a quality education with rigorous academic standards, and at the same time giving students a safe haven in which to learn and grow. Thank you Sister!  Sr. Janet leaves as her legacy the fulfillment of the mission of the office of Catholic Youth and School Services to ``assist the Bishop in his teaching mission by serving, challenging, and supporting the leaders of youth formation and education who minister in schools and parishes in the Diocese of Toledo.'' Though her daily presence will be missed, Toledo's Catholic youth services bear her imprimatur.                          ____________________
