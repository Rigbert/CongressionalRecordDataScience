Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I recommend that all Members join me in supporting this conference agreement. Its presentation has been bipartisan, and the chairman has been fair throughout his preparation. I would also join the chairman in adding my appreciation to the staff led on the majority side by Kevin Cook. He is joined by Terry Tyborowski, John Blazey, Scott Burnison and Tracy LaTurner. They are a very strong team.  On the minority staff, I would like to thank Dixon Butler. This year we have two of the finest detailees ever from the Army Corps, Taunja Berquam helping with the majority and Felicia Kirksey helping with the minority. I would also thank Kenny Kraft on Chairman Hobson's staff as well as Peder Maarbjerg on mine.  Conference negotiations this year were protracted and their favorable resolution required both patience and firmness in pushing for positive reforms of the Corps of Engineers management practices.  I want to thank Chairman Lewis as well as Ranking Member Obey for their steadfast support in getting this done.  As I said in my remarks earlier this year, Chairman Hobson has led our subcommittee to take a long-term perspective on a number of important issues, and this is resulting in some profound and positive changes, including saner and safer policies on nuclear weapons, insistence on 5-year planning from the Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, and the Department ofEnergy; a focus on completing projects in management reforms, particularly at the Corps. On this side of the aisle I am pleased to have had the opportunity to support my chairman on these issues.                              {time}  1245  The conferees were given an allocation of $749 million larger than was available when the House developed its bill back in the spring. The tragic events that resulted from the hurricanes demonstrated that our Nation has crying needs in the areas served by the program of the corps, and we have devoted the increased funds to meet these needs along the Gulf of Mexico and across the Nation.

On this side of the aisle, I am pleased to have had the opportunity to support him on these issues.  The conferees were given an allocation $749 million larger than was available when the House developed its bill back in the Spring. The tragic events that resulted from hurricanes Katrina and Rita demonstrated that our Nation has crying needs in the areas served by the programs of the Corps of Engineers, and we have devoted the increased funds to meeting these needs both along the Gulf of Mexico and across the Nation.  The Energy and Water Development conference agreement had to work within the constraints that started with the President's budget request and its inadequate commitment of resources to the programs of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The events of this year amply demonstrated the latent threats to our Nation from natural disasters and the failure of inadequate manmade structures. The Congress is doing the right thing in increasing spending on the Corps in FY 2006 by more than $1 billion over the request. Hopefully the Administration will now understand the level of investment needed and submit a budget for FY 2007 that sustains and extends this investment level for the water infrastructure of our Nation.  An additional top priority within the Energy and Water appropriations is nuclear nonproliferation. While the overall level included in the conference agreement is slightly below the request, considerable funds have been shifted from a construction project with major unspent balances to support of high priority programs to help Russia protect and control its nuclear weapons material. The Russian side has signaled strong willingness in this area, and bureaucratic obstacles in the U.S. have been removed. We must seize this opportunity for the increased safety of us all.  Alas, this conference agreement is limited by an overall constraint forced by allocation.  Four fifths of the Energy and Water funding goes to the Department of Energy, but energy research, development and demonstration is only 10% of the Department. The cost of gasoline, natural gas, and home heating oil have exploded over the past 18 months. Only the Federal Government can invest in the long-term R&D needed and stimulate demonstration and deployment of new technologies through partnerships with the private sector.  When our Nation faced high costs and uncertain supplies for energy in the mid-1970s, President Carter and Congress, made major investments in energy conservation and renewable energy along with unconventional sources of fossil fuels were funded. A comparable response today would require quadrupling our support for renewable energy and doubling our support for conservation R&D at DOE. As a start, Democrats advocated for creation of an energy independence fund of one-quarter billion dollars of new money at DOE at the time the House considered the Energy and Water appropriations bill.  The prosperity of our Nation is built in part on preeminence in almost all areas of fundamental science research. The Department of Energy is the primary supporter of physical science research and provides state-of-the-art user facilities available to investigators from government, academia, and industry.  The constraints on this conference agreement have allowed only one area of research and user support to be increased above the request--high performance computing. This is an area where the United States invented the field and long held undisputed leadership in the world. Several years ago, that leadership was challenged by Japan with their development of the Earth Simulator. For three years in a row, the Congress has had to increase support substantially in this area to sustain momentum in reachieving U.S. leadership.  The conference agreement provides no increased support for the operations of DOE user facilities. Construction of these facilities represents a major investment. Before the recent run-up in energy prices, it was estimated that an additional $95 million was required to operate these facilities at full capacity. Operation of these facilities is energy intensive, and the FY 2006 operating levels are likely to be smaller than planned.  Within the constraints of the conference allocation, the Energy and Water conferees have made good choices for our Nation. I ask for support for this measure.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
