 Republicans are no less interested in doing the right thing for the country than Democrats are. I don't question the motives of our friends on the other side of the aisle, and I know they don't question ours. We have some serious differences about what we ought to do. Those discussions have been ongoing, and we will continue them throughout the evening and maybe well into the weekend until we get some kind of consensus about what is the most appropriate thing to do to help jump-start our ailing economy.
