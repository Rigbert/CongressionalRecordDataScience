We are attempting to make sure that any lands that are acquired, it takes it off the tax roll, that there is full reimbursement for those small communities. I understand the problem. We have gone from 7.5 in 25 years to 1.5 of rural community. I understand the problem, because I have this affecting me in Alaska. But we were trying to do something correct. Very frankly I think we did do something correct. We fully funded it.
