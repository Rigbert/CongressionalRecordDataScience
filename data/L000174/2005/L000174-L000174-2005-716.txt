President, I am pleased that the Senate is going to pass S. 289, a bill to reauthorize the Mental Health Court Program and provide $10 million in grant funding annually for mental health courts through fiscal year 2011. I am the lead Democratic sponsor of this bill, and cosponsored similar legislation in the last Congress.  Senator DeWine and I have worked together on a number of mental health issues. Last year, we worked together to enact the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act, which authorizes $50 million annually for a range of State and local projects designed to reduce the number of crimes committed by mentally ill individuals. We are now working together to obtain appropriations to fund the new law.  As former prosecutors, Senator DeWine and I both realize the tremendous impact of mental illness on our criminal justice system. We need to stop the ``revolving door'' whereby mentally ill offenders cycle in and out of the criminal justice system for relatively minor offenses, taking up the time and resources of law enforcement officers, judges, and the community as a whole. My State of Vermont has benefited from funding under the Mental Health Court Program, and I know firsthand the good that mental health courts can do.  I hope the House will take up this bipartisan and uncontroversial legislation promptly and ensure that Federal support for mental health courts will continue.
