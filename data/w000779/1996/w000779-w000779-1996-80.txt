President, I rise today to introduce legislation withSenator D'Amato to reauthorize the Self-Employment Act. As waves of economic change turn our economy into a high-wire act, the Self-Employment Act has helped turn the unemployment safety net into a trampoline of opportunity for the unemployed. The Self-Employment Assistance Program takes an innovative and cost-effective approach to helping eligible dislocated workers become self-sufficient; it enables them to use their weekly unemployment checks to start their own businesses.  Harvard Business School reported earlier this year that from 1978 to the present, 22 percent of the work force, or 3 million workers, at the country's top 100 companies had been laid off, and that 77 percent of all the layoffs involved white-collar workers. Many of these highly skilled workers will never be able to return to their former positions, but some are highly motivated to start their own firms. In 40 out of 50 States, however, those who start their own businesses are forced to give up their weekly unemployment compensation checks as soon as the company starts generating revenue--but before it provides enough income to support the worker. It is exactly this problem the Self-Employment Assistance Program is designed to correct.  In a few short years, the Self-Employment Act (Public Law 103-182; title V) has already enabled thousands of unemployed Americans to use their unemployment compensation to establish new businesses. Two experimental programs, in Massachusetts and Washington, have already shown that self-employment programs can create jobs at no cost to the taxpayer. Using existing funds, the Massachusetts program created dozens of new businesses but actually paid $1,400 less unemployment per worker than the State average. The Washington program created more than 600 new jobs and the firms were paying an average of $10.50 an hour to workers they had hired.  The legislation we introduce today reauthorize a program that allows--but does not require--State to establish self-employment assistance [SEA] programs as part of their unemployment insurance [UI] programs. It permits States to provide income support payments to the unemployed in the same weekly amount as the worker's regular unemployment insurance [UI] benefits would otherwise be, so that they may work full time on starting their own business instead of searching for traditional wage and salary jobs. In effect, this legislation removes a high hurdle facing those who have the ingenuity, motivation, and energy to start their own businesses. It eliminates a barrier in the law that has forced workers interested in self-employment to choose between receiving UI benefits and starting a new business.  Self-employment assistance has not only proved to be a viable reemployment option for unemployed workers; its benefits have exceeded its costs as well. While the law is not a panacea for all of our Nation's unemployed, it's an opportunity for many skilled workers to get back to work faster and helps create new jobs as well.  In a recent tour around Oregon, my State SEA officials found tremendous enthusiasm for this program. They reported to me: ``* * * the SEA Program in Oregon is meeting the goal of providing Oregon dislocated workers--as identified through worker profiling--with access to entrepreneurial training and financial assistance while pursuing self-employment and the establishment of a business.'' Among the examples of businesses developed under the Oregon SEA Program this year are a marine maintenance and repair company, drop-in day care centers at shopping malls and a handmade hats, quilts, and bags business working to develop a mail-order firm.  The 1993 SEA law is based upon self-employment programs that have worked well in 17 other industrialized nations. As the author of two laws, in 1987 and 1993, that have promoted self-employment, I can attest to the dramatic success of the self-employment concept. According to a June 1995 Department of Labor [DOL] evaluation of the Washington State and Massachusetts pilot programs, the two projects ``clearly demonstrate that self-employment is a viable reemployment option for some unemployed workers . . . about one-half of those interested actually do start a business and an average of two-thirds were still in business 3 years later.'' In addition, the DOL report found that self-employment assistance programs increased business starts among project participants, reduced the length of their unemployment periods and increased their total time in employment. Both the Washington and Massachusetts models proved to be cost effective for the participants as well as for taxpayers.  Over the past 2\1/2\ years, 10 States used the 1993 legislation to create self-employment programs: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, and Rhode Island. To date, DOL has approved six State plans--California, Delaware, Maine, New Jersey, New York, and Oregon--and four of these--Delaware, Maine, New York and Oregon--have actually implemented their SEA programs.  Let me briefly describe how the program works. The law directs the DOL to review and approve State SEA Program plans. In States that operate SEA programs, new UI claimants identified through worker profiling--automated systems that use a set of criteria to identify those claimants who are likely to exhaust their UI benefits and need reemployment assistance--will be eligible for self-employment assistance. State SEA programs provide participants with periodic--weekly or biweekly--self-employment allowances while they are getting their businesses off the ground. These support payments are the same weekly amount as the worker's regular UI benefits. The SEA participants are required to participate in technical assistance programs--entrepreneurial training--accounting, cash flow, finances, taxes, etc.--business counseling--business plans, marketing, legal requirements, insurance, etc.--and finance--to ensure they have the skills necessary to operate a business. Finally, SEA programs are required to operate at no additional cost to the unemployment trust fund: The law stipulates that the payment of SEA allowances may not result in any additional benefits charges to the unemployment trust fund. Individuals may choose at any time to opt out of the SEA Program; they may resume collection of regular unemployment compensation until the total amount of regular unemployment compensation paid and the SEA paid equals the maximum benefit amount. States are responsible for the costs of providing basic SEA Program services, like business counseling and technical assistance, but may allow participants to pay for more intensive counseling and technical assistance.  Mr. President, as we move into the global economy of the 21st century, it is imperative that the Government adopt fresh strategies so that our many skilled buy unemployed workers can start anew in the private sector. Congress should extend the Self-Employment Assistance Program so that States will have the continued flexibility to help unemployed workers create their own businesses. Our bipartisan bill promotes the spirit of entrepreneurship. It carries forward a reasonable, and sensible reform of the unemployment insurance system that bears no cost to the taxpayer.  I would like to thank Senator D'Amato for joining me as an original cosponsor of this bill. New York has a very active and successful Self Employment Assistance Program, and I look forward to working closely with him to see this important program reauthorized.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2029       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
