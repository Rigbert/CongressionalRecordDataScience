Chair, I am urging a ``yes'' vote on this amendment and ``no'' on the legislation itself.  And, again, I think the gentleman from California (Mr. Huffman) has done a great disservice to the people of Alaska, especially the natives. He has divided us, and that is not right.  The floor of this House has divided a culture, different cultures, Alaska Natives, and it is for that I am deeply regretful. It shows what you can do when you interfere with other people's districts.  This House used to be a House of the people. Now it is a House of what? What have they done in 2 years? Nothing.  Now they are trying to undo what was done legitimately in 40 years. And so I understand it. You have the votes. I understand that. It is not going to become law. I hope you understand that.  And we are going to have a sale--I hope you understand that--and then my people that I represent will, in fact, get their just due. I know that.  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
