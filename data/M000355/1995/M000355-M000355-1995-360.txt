 GORTON. Yes, I would be glad to do so.  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator. The bill, at section 106, sets out a provision to hold individuals who misuse or alter a product accountable for any injury resulting from the misuse or alteration. This provision would allow for the reduction of damages based on such misuse or alteration.  This section, at 106(b), also provides that this provision only supersedes State laws that do not already impose such apportioning of damages among responsible parties, including the injured party found to have misused or altered the product, is that not correct?
