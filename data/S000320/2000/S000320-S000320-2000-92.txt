 President, I rise today to introduce the ``Freedom from Behavioral Profiling Act of 2000.'' This legislation would disallow financial institutions from buying and selling an individual's most personal and detailed buying habits without proper notification and without his or her permission. Put another way, financial institutions would only be allowed to buy, sell or otherwise share an individual's behavioral profile if the institution has disclosed to the consumer that such information may be shared and the institution has received the consumer's affirmative consent to do so.  Technology exists today that allows financial institutions to monitor and collect your personal buying and spending habits. According to the April 3 issue of Business Week magazine, Visa International is ``using neural networks to build up elaborate behavioral profiles. Over months, these systems . . . track a person's behavior online and off, then match it against models of similar personality and behavior types . . .''  What this means is that financial institutions have the ability to follow you to the grocery store to track your purchases--whether you are abiding by your doctors recommended diet--and then to the drug store to see what kind of drugs you are purchasing. The institution can also track where you go throughout the day and into the evening, and exactly what time you were there.  Business Week also reported that such ``far-flung threads'' as your ``taste in paperbacks, political discussion groups'' and clothing are being ``sewn into online profiles where they are increasingly intertwined with your data on health, your education loans and your credit history.'' What does this information have to do with getting a mortgage? More importantly, are these institutions sharing these behavioral profiles? Given the track record of some of the blue chip firms like Chase Manhattan Bank and U.S. Bancorp, I believe the risk is too great to assume otherwise.  Even more important, what happens when these behavioral profiles get into the wrong hands? That rarely happens you say. Guess again. A Russian teenager using the name ``Maxus'' stole 350,000 credit card numbers from CD Universe's Web site last December. He then told CD Universe that he would post the numbers on the Internet unless they paid him $100,000. When they refused to pay him he posted the credit cards numbers and thousands of visitors downloaded more than 25,000 account numbers between December 25 and January 7.  A similar case happened on March 24 of this year when two teens in a small Welsh village hacked into computers of several online merchants making off with more than 26,000 credit card numbers. The FBI says losses connected to the thefts could exceed $3 million.  Mr. President, if teenagers from around the world are gaining access to account numbers, there is no question they can steal data banks of behavioral profiles. In fact, they are. A front page article in the New York Times dated April 3, 2000, reports that ``Law enforcement authorities are becoming increasingly worried about a sudden, sharp rise in the incidence of identity theft, the outright pilfering of people's personal information and, with that information in hand, thieves can acquire credit, make purchases and even secure residences in someone else's name.''  Mr. President, an important point here is that potential criminals do not even have to steal the information. Due to the significant loopholes in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act passed last year, an individual's behavioral profile could legally be passed along without the affirmative consent of that individual. The unchecked growth of data banks and the business of profiling unquestionably facilitates identity theft.  Some may suggest that there is no harm in behavioral profiling. I disagree. Despite the fact that consumers are ``shielded'' in fraudulent cases, subject to only $50 maximum liability, the burden is on credit card owners to prove the fraudulent charges are not their own. If the fraudulent charge is not found immediately, continued purchases or applications for more cards by the criminal can wreak havoc on an individual's credit rating. In fact, one witness recently testified before the Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Government Information that she spent over 400 hours trying to clear her name and restore her good credit.  In ``card-not-present'' transactions, that is orders by mail, telephone or Internet where no signature is required, merchants are forced to cover the loss. Thus, identity theft and fraudulent purchases also take a toll on the small business man. Reports suggest that one out of every ten online purchases is fraudulent. My colleagues know that small businesses do not have the margins to eat the charge on one out of every 10 purchases.  Mr. President, the American people are only now becoming aware of the behavioral profiling practices of the industry. The more they find out, the more they do not like it. That is why I am offering this legislation . . . to give the consumer the ability to control his or her most personal behavioral profile. Where they go, who they see, what they buy and when they do it--all of these are personal decisions that the majority of Americans do not want monitored and recorded under the watchful eye of corporate America.  Mr. President, colleagues in the Senate, I hope you will join me in an effort to give the people what they want--the ability to control the indiscriminate sharing of their own personal, and private, consumption habits.                                 ______                                       By
