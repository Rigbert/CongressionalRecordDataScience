Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I will not take 5 minutes, but I rise to support the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters). The world community is crying out for help. The people of the world all over this little planet that we call spaceship Earth are not crying out for bombs, for missiles, for more guns. They are crying out for food, for shelter, for medical assistance, for economic assistance. They are crying out tonight for debt relief.  This is the year of Jubilee. This is the year to help, to help our brothers and sisters in need. We have a moral obligation to help. We shall respond to the Macedonian call of old. There are people in need. They are hurting. They are suffering.  In Africa, a modern day Holocaust is in the making. Five thousand people will die every single day. We cannot stand solemnly by. If we fail to act and we fail to stand up and help, in the end, we are not worthy of a great people or great nation. The spirit of history will not be kind to us.  So, Mr. Chairman, we have a moral obligation, a mandate to do what we can to bring relief to our sisters and to our brothers in other lands. We do not live on this little island, on this little piece of real estate alone.  Just maybe, just maybe our foremothers and our forefathers all came to this great country in different ships. But we all are in the same boat now. If we want to live in a world at peace with itself, we must reach out and help those in need. It is Africa. It is a Third World today. We do not know who it will be tomorrow.
