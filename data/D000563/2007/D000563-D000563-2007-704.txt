President, I am sorry the Republican leader would not yield for a question. My question would have been, the 60-vote requirement for this amendment so that our troops have time to rest before they are redeployed into combat, this 60-vote requirement which the Republican leader says is routine and normal, I was going to ask the Republican leader, in the two previous Defense authorization bills brought to the floor of the Senate, how many times did we impose a 60-vote requirement on amendments to that bill?
