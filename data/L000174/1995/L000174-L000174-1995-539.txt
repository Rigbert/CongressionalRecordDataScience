President, I hope that my colleagues will support the Jeffords-Leahy amendment. If you defeat this amendment, you help nobody in the country, but you hurt one State, the State of Vermont. This simply says that Vermont, provided we want to operate beyond what may be required under Federal laws, would be allowed to do so; that if we want to set up a procedure that fulfills everything that the Federal law might require but does even better but fits our small very special State, that we be allowed to do so.  Basically, we are saying to every Member of the Senate who has given speeches over the last year that States can design programs better, we agree and let us do that. We are making sure that we violate no Federal law, that we have followed every Federal rule, but we be allowed to design something that fits our State.  Every single Senator, I am willing to wager, Mr. President, in this body, has given a speech saying, ``If we can do it better, allow us to do it, allow us to design it.''  Basically what the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords] and I are saying is that is what we want to do. So let us adopt this. This is no different than taking care of a unique situation for Alabama yesterday in the product liability bill. This takes care of Vermont. It hurts nobody, but it helps us.
