Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Kalamazoo County Prosecuting Attorney Jim Gregart, who is approaching the end of a long and distinguished career of public service. A dedicated and committed individual, Jim has served the communities and families of southwest Michigan for the last 35 years. Through his leadership and enthusiasm to his profession, Jim has helped to make our corner of Michigan an even better and safer place to live and grow.  Since coming to the city of Kalamazoo, Michigan, Jim has been widely known for his extensive charity and dedication to local individuals and the community as a whole. Over his inspiring career, Jim has been devoted to improving the lives of countless individuals who had the fortune of crossing his path. The area is forever in his debt. There is no question that Jim's ardor for the law and betterment of society will be greatly missed.  Jim has been involved in many faucets of our local and State community. His contribution to the improvement to our way of life has been immense. Whether he is dedicating his time and energy to the Kalamazoo Red Cross, Muscular Dystrophy Association, Boys and Girls Club, American Lung Association or Kalamazoo County Humane Society, Jim's work has always been inspirational.  Many words come to mind as one reflects upon Jim's public service to our community. He is selfless, generous, giving, caring, humble, the list goes on. His integrity is impeccable and has long been known as being the standard of fairness and equality. On behalf of the Sixth District of Michigan, I wish Jim and his family all the best in retirement--we are all better off because of his service.                          ____________________
