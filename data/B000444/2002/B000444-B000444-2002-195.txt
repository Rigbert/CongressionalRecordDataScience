 When the annual tradition originated more than 75 years ago, ``black history'' was barely studied. African-Americans had been in this country at least as far back as colonial times, but the history books largely ignored the black American population and the experiences that sprang from it.  However, prodded by the vision and ambition of Dr. Carter G. Woodson--one of this country's great historians and the son of former slaves--all of that began to change in 1926. In that year, we first recognized ``Negro History Week'' and later, in 1976, expanded the celebration to span a full month. Now, Black History Month is celebrated all over North America.  Our Nation is far different today from the nation that existed when we started this annual tradition. Racial discrimination--once buttressed by our legal system--is no longer sanctioned by law. Segregated lunch counters and water fountains--commonplace only a few decades ago--are now relics of the past. Barriers like poll taxes and other shams--once tolerated--are no longer permitted to bar African-Americans from voting.  Yes, America is a far better and much richer country today because of the enlightenment delivered, in no small part, by the leaders and foot soldiers of the movement for civil rights. They awakened a nation to the cause of equality and justice for all--and, because of their courage and foresight, America is stronger. We are undoubtedly better thinkers because of it . . . and better citizens because of it.  Yet, it is that sense of accomplishment that is, perhaps, our greatest enemy. Having survived the civil rights movement and then reaped the benefits that struggle produced, we are inclined to believe that our work is done, that racial disparities don't exist. But that simply is not true.  While we may no longer tolerate legal discrimination and segregation--more than ever before--we live segregated lives in segregated neighborhoods. We worship in segregated churches, synagogues and mosques. And nearly a half century after the landmark desegregation case Brown v. Board of Education, our kids still attend largely segregated schools.  Now is no time to rest on the accomplishments of yesteryear. We must remain vigilant in our efforts and true to the vision of legends like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Shirley Chisholm and Thurgood Marshall and Barbara Jordan--all of whom knew what we now know--namely, that America can only be great when all her citizens are afforded an equal opportunity to grow and learn and, themselves, be great.  I was called to the U.S. Senate 30 years ago, inspired largely by this promise of equal opportunity and by the legions of civil rights workers who risked life and limb to ensure that America kept that promise.  When I commenced my service in 1972, we were living in tumultuous times--only a few years before, this country had witnessed the assassination of her bravest sons; we had survived a war abroad; and our security at home threatened, then, by unfriendly foreign powers and a deeply divided public--was uncertain. I thought then, as I do now, that vigilance and strong, outspoken leadership could usher in the healing and transformation we so desperately needed.  Today, as America commemorates Black History Month, we are again facing troubled times. The tragic events of September 11th have tested our commitment to keeping America's promise to all her citizens. We honor the nearly 3,000 innocents who died in New York, at the Pentagon and in that field in western Pennsylvania not by cowering in fear or by abandoning our guarantee of traditional civil rights. Rather, we honor their lives by, again, remaining vigilant and by exercising strong leadership in opposition to intolerance and prejudice in our society. We honor them by remaining true to our democratic principles and sense of justice. We honor them by seeking opportunities to speak out against hatred and unfairness and inequality.  During this Black History Month and every month, we must remind ourselves of the great road we've traveledbut, at the same time, renew our commitment to the basic truths and objectives that inspired the journey in the first place. This month and every month, we must re-dedicate ourselves to keeping America's promise.                          ____________________
