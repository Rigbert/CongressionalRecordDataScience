President, I come to the floor today to announce my opposition to CAFTA. Some expect Democratic Senators to by and large oppose trade agreements and Republican Senators to support them. I come to this debate as a Democratic Senator who has supported trade agreements in the past. I supported NAFTA, permanent normal trade relations for China, trade agreements for Chile, Singapore, Morocco, and Australia. I think globalization is as inevitable as gravity. We have to accept the fact that America cannot be a rich and prosperous country by selling to ourselves. Merely doing one another's laundry will not create wealth and will not improve our standard of living. We need markets. That is why I have supported trade agreements in the past.  I also understand that as you expand trade, there is pain and there is gain. We have seen it happen throughout the history of the world that as trade expands, some industries expand with it and others decline. When we Americans look at the course of history, we find strong evidence that joining together democracy and free markets is a winning combination. Expanding trade goes hand in hand with pushing the concepts of freedom, ingenuity, innovation, efficiency--all sorts of respect for people at every level. That is one of the reasons I have supported some trade agreements in the past. That is the very reason I oppose CAFTA.  I am disappointed. If there is one casualty in CAFTA, that casualty would be the worker--not just the American worker but the workers in Central America. We know what is happening. We have seen over the past 4 years that America has lost one out of every six manufacturing jobs in the last 4 years and few months. It hit my State pretty hard. Several hundred thousand manufacturing jobs in Illinois are gone, never to return. It is happening across America.
