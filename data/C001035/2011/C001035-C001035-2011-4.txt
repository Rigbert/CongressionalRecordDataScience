President, today, I commend Orono Middle School of Orono, ME, on being named a 2011 National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence. This prestigious recognition of high accomplishment was bestowed by U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan.  Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Schools award is considered the highest honor an American school can obtain. Schools singled out for this national recognition reflect the goals of our Nation's education reforms for high standards and accountability. Specifically, the Blue Ribbon Schools Program is designed to honor public and private schools that are either academically superior in their States or that demonstrate dramatic gains in student achievement.  This award recognizes that Orono Middle School students achieve at the highest level academically. Orono Middle School is a top-performing schoolon State-required assessments, and staff at the school use assessments throughout the academic year as a tool for improving and customizing instruction. The school also involves students in extracurricular activities, which helps forge a strong school community where students are connected and encouraged to pursue their interests.  I applaud not only the students but also the teachers, staff, administrators, and parents of Orono Middle School. Together, they are succeeding in their mission to generate confidence and momentum for learning. They are making a difference in the lives of their students, helping them reach their full potential as independent, responsible learners and citizens.  I am pleased that the U.S. Department of Education has selected Orono Middle School for this well-deserved honor, and I congratulate the entire community for this outstanding achievement.                          ____________________
