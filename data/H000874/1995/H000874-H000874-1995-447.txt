Chairman, I offer an amendment to the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York [Mr. Gilman].  The Clerk read as follows:       Amendment offered by Mr. Hoyer to the amendment to the      amendment offered by Mr. Gilman:       At the end of the amendment, add the following: In title      XXVI (relating to foreign policy provisions) insert the      following at the end of chapter 1:     SEC. 2604. BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA SELF-DEFENSE ACT.       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Bosnia      and Herzegovina Self-Defense Act''.       (b) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The Serbian aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina      continues into its third year, the violence has escalated and      become widespread, and ethnic cleansing by Serbs has been      renewed.       (2) It has been almost one year since the Bosnian      Government unconditionally, and on time, accepted the      ``Contact Group'' plan, which the Serb forces have rejected.       (3) The United Nations has failed to protect its declared      safe havens from continuing and relentless Serbian      aggression, and has failed to order North Atlantic Treaty      Organization (NATO) air strikes against Serb forces in      retaliation for their attacks on Sarajevo, despite calls from      its own field commander to do so.       (4) The United Nations Security Council has not considered      a resolution providing for the multilateral termination of      the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina, which would      be the preferred course of action to allow that country to      defend itself.       (5) The United Nations Security Council has not taken      measures necessary to maintain international peace and      security in Bosnia and Herzegovina since the aggression      against that country began in April 1992. [[Page H5713]]        (6) For the reasons stated in section 520 of the Foreign      Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995      (Public Law 103-236), the Congress has found that continued      application of an international arms embargo to the      Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina contravenes that      Government's inherent right of individual or collective self-     defense under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, and      therefore is inconsistent with international law.       (c) Statement of Purpose.--The Congress supports the      efforts of the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and      Herzegovina--       (1) to defend its people and the territory of the Republic;       (2) to preserve the sovereignty, independence, and      territorial integrity of the Republic; and       (3) to bring about a peaceful, just, fair, viable, and      sustainable settlement of the conflict in Bosnia and      Herzegovina.       (d) Termination of Arms Embargo.--       (1) Termination.--The President shall terminate the United      States arms embargo of the Government of Bosnia and      Herzegovina upon receipt from that Government of a request      for assistance in exercising its right of self-defense under      Article 51 of the United States Charter.       (2) Definition.--As used in this section, the term ``United      States arms embargo of the Government of Bosnia and      Herzegovina'' means the application to the Government of      Bosnia and Herzegovina of--       (A) the policy adopted July 10, 1991, and published in the      Federal Register of July 19, 1991 (58 FR 33322) under the      heading ``Suspension of Munitions Export Licensees to      Yugoslavia''; and       (B) any similar policy applied by the United States      Government as of the date of receipt of the request described      in paragraph (1) pursuant to which approval is denied for      transfers of defense articles and defense services to the      former Yugoslavia.       (3) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this section shall be      interpreted as authorization for deployment of United States      forces in the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina for any      purpose, including training, support, or delivery of military      equipment.
