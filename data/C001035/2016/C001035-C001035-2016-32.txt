President, this amendment is a commonsense approach to help make Americans safer. And I think it is highly significant that we have just received a letter that is signed by a group of generals and admirals who have been on the frontlines in fighting terrorism--people like General Petraeus--who are endorsing the bipartisan amendment that we have put forth.  Mr. President, let's not miss this opportunity to make a difference, to get something done. Let's listen to the heartbroken families in Orlando, in San Bernardino, in other terrorist attacks. This is common sense. It does not infringe upon the Second Amendment rights of Americans. All it does is say that if you are too dangerous to board an airplane, you are too dangerous to buy a gun. I urge my colleagues to support our amendment.  I thank the Senator from Maryland.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). The majority leader.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes, equally divided, prior to each vote today.
