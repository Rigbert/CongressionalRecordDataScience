Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, today we will consider House Resolution 132, which expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals' recent ruling in Newdow v. United States Congress is inconsistent with the Supreme Court's interpretation of the first amendment and urges the Attorney General to appeal its decision.  We are here today because the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit continues to get it wrong.  On February 28, 2003, as our country continued preparations for what is now an impending war to defend the values upon which our great Nation is founded, the Ninth Circuit refused to rehear the case of Newdow v. U.S. Congress. In Newdow, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the voluntary, voluntary recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance by public school students violates the first amendment because it includes the phrase ``one Nation under God.'' In addition, on February 28, the three-judge panel amended its June 2002 ruling and held that the Elk Grove, California, school district policy of opening each school day with the voluntary recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag ``impermissibly coerces a religious act'' on the part of those students who choose not to recite the Pledge and, thus, violates the Establishment Clause of the first amendment.  This second preposterous ruling by the most-often reversed appellate court in the Nation impels us to come to the House floor again to voice our profound disagreement. House Resolution 132 expresses the sense of the House that the phrase ``one Nation, under God'' should remain in the Pledge of Allegiance and that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in Newdow v. U.S. Congress is inconsistent with the Supreme Court's interpretation of the first amendment.  It also urges the Attorney General of the United States to repeal the Ninth Circuit's ruling and urges the President to nominate and the Senate to confirm Federal circuit court judges who will interpret the Constitution consistent with the Constitution's text. House Resolution 132 also encourages school districts across the Nation to continue reciting the Pledge daily and praises the Elk Grove School District for its defense of the Pledge of Allegiance against this specious constitutional challenge.  Since the Pledge of Allegiance is not a prayer nor a statement of religious faith, the recitation of the Pledge is not a religious exercise. Rather, it is a patriotic exercise in which one expresses support for the United States of America and pledges allegiance to the flag, the principles for which the flag stands, and to the Nation. To conclude otherwise is to ignore clear precedent from the Supreme Court.  If this latest ruling is allowed to stand, schoolchildren at every public school in nine States, a total of 9,600,000 students, will be prohibited from reciting the pledge. Furthermore, the constitutionality of the voluntary recitation by public school students of numerous historical and founding documents such as the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Gettysburg Address has been placed into serious doubt. When one considers how this decision distorts Establishment Clause jurisprudence, the importance of appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution consistent with its text becomes clear.  Congress has consistently supported the Pledge of Allegiance by starting each session of the House with its recitation. The House reaffirmed its support for the Pledge when, on June 27, 2002, it adopted House Resolution 459, which I introduced, by a vote of 416 to three. The House should do the same with House Resolution 132 today.  I am proud to serve as an original cosponsor of this measure, and I urge my colleagues to support it.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1145
