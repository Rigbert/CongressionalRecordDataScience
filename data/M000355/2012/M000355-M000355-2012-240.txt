 President, I certainly share my friend the majority leader's views about Senator Lugar's record, but he has 8 more months to be among us and to serve this country. I think an appropriate time to celebrate his outstanding career would be when it comes to an end here in the Senate.                            Time for Action  With regard to what has been going on here in the Senate, the problem clearly is the majority, which seems not to be interested in accomplishing anything but, rather, turning the Senate floor into an opportunity for show votes for the President and his campaign.  Earlier this week the President repackaged a list of old ideas into a Post-it note checklist for Congress. He said he did not want to ``overload'' Congress. Unfortunately, besides the weekly political show votes to which I just referred to coincide with the President's campaign schedule, the work that needs to be done isn't--no budget, nothing to prevent the largest tax hike in history, and House-passed bills sitting in the hopper.  While the President is trying to manufacture arguments he can run on, House Republicans have spent the last year and a half voting on and passing energy and jobs bills. In fact, more than two dozen jobs proposals are currently collecting dust on the majority leader's desk. One after another, the House has passed a budget, a small business tax bill, bills to expand domestic energy production, and bills to reduce burdensome, job-killing regulations. Despite some saying nothing can get done in an election year, they are not done yet over in the House. I commend my House colleagues for their leadership, energy, and good work.  I have a suggestion. Instead of focusing on his political Post-it note checklist, the President and Senate Democrats should show some leadership and work with Republicans to move on critical progrowth bills.
