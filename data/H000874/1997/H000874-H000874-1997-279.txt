Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time, and I thank my friend from California for letting me proceed.  I want to say that those of us who are not expert in the field of patents, and I dare say that is probably 100 percent of us, some of us know more than others, that is for sure, but I would presume, unless there is a patent lawyer among us, obviously Mr. Campbell, a law professor, a distinguished law professor, has done a lot of work on this. I am a lawyer, but I want to have a disclaimer at the front that I do not know a lot about this issue from a technical standpoint.  So like most Members, I come from the standpoint of what is best for the people I represent? What is best for the country? What is best for competitiveness, both domestically and internationally, and what best protects the people that I represent?  Now, very frankly, I have heard from numerous people, individuals who are very concerned about this bill. I have read in The New York Times, for instance, articles of inventors, small business, associations who are very concerned at the exposure that this bill brings. The gentlewoman from Ohio [Ms. Kaptur] referred to the time of 18 months or 17 years or 20 years or whatever the time frame might be.  I have heard the debate back and forth. I would say to my friends that, at the outset, I do accept the premise of the CRS report, that both bills not only seek, as has been pointed out, but do, in fact, accomplish the objective of getting at the problem, to the extent it exists, of the submarine patents.  The gentleman from California [Mr. Hunter] who spoke earlier pointed out that there were some 300 submarine patents that could be described out of the millions of patents. So the percentage of submarine patents, if they exist, and obviously they do, is as the gentleman from California [Mr. Hunter] pointed out, incredibly small.  In pursuit of that objective, we are placing at risk the 99.9 percent of inventors, innovators, entrepreneurs who have an idea that they want to protect so that they can justifiably profit in a free enterprise system from the integrity and protection of that idea.  It is for that reason, my friends, that I rise, convinced not of the technical merits one way or the other, because as I said at the outset, I am not an expert, but that there is so much concern in the small business community.  I believe this bill would harm small business and independent inventors. We must remember that small business, as all of us know, represents the fastest growing sector of the economy and are truly America's greatest source of job creation and technology development.  I am not opposed to everything in H.R. 400, as I am sure most are not. In fact, I know my friend [Mr. Rohrabacher], the principal sponsor of the alternative, which I support, is not an opponent of all. I support the inventor protection electronic filing sections of the bill. However, despite the rhetoric surrounding the manager's amendment, the publication time still poses a threat to America's small business.  Too many small business organizations have voiced their concerns and opposition to H.R. 400. I am not going to go through the list, but my colleagues have seen, I think most of our colleagues have seen, the list of 2 or 3 pages, small-type, of small inventors, small investors, small businessmen and entrepreneurs who are concerned and have said, do not move on this bill.                              {time}  1715  In fact, the Chamber of Commerce itself has held itself aloof from this bill. The Chamber of Commerce itself has held itself aloof from this bill because they believe there is a risk.  Mr. Chairman, it is a strange alliance that we see on this floor on this bill, on both sides, perhaps because some come from a more involved process with this bill and some a less involved, and are, frankly, looking not so much at the technical aspects of this bill but at the risks that it will pose to the people from whom we are hearing.  Mr. Chairman, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, as I said, has been conspicuously silent on this bill, and the National Association for the Self-Employed, an organization of 325,000 members, is not only silent, they are strongly opposed to H.R. 400, because they believe it places their small business people at risk. This is a very important issue. We must not rush to judgment. In fact, we are not rushing to judgment, as the gentleman from Alabama is pointing out to me.  The proponents of H.R. 400 claim that there are remedies and processes set upto protect small business. If that is the case, why have the Chamber and the NFIB and small business and small inventors not come forward and said that they have achieved protection? They have not. In fact, they have done the opposite, as I said. Three hundred twenty-five thousand strong have said, we are strongly opposed to this bill.  We all know that small businesses have neither the attorneys nor the resources. The gentleman from California [Mr. Campbell] has spoken to this, the gentleman from California [Mr. Rohrabacher], the gentlewoman from Ohio [Ms. Kaptur] have all spoken to it. It is fine to say, yes, if they learn your information very early on you get protection, because you were published. That is great.  That is great, and if you have $1 million or $5 million, like some of the egregious people, I understand, and let us not hoist on the petard of one or two or three multimillionaires who are gaming the system, thousands of folks who are not only not gaming the system but it is the only protection that they have.  Mr. Chairman, in closing, because my time is coming to a close, let me say that I am also concerned, as someone who is deeply involved in governmental organization issues, deeply involved in Federal employee issues, I understand that my friends in the NTU believe that H.R. 400, my good friend, the gentlewoman from California [Ms. Lofgren] who has fought so fervently for this bill, she and I disagree on the substance, but she is an able advocate of this bill, and they have talked about the NTU.  Let me say, as so many have said on this floor, I am concerned about this critically important process, which must be insulated from outside influence, being altered in the way that H.R. 400 alters it; that it is not a Federal employee, insulated from outside pressure and influence and involvement, who will make decisions critical to the economic welfare not only of small business and inventors and innovators, but also of this country.  So I would ask my colleagues to vote for the amendment offered by the gentleman from California [Mr. Rohrabacher], incorporating the amendment of the gentleman from California [Mr. Hunter] as well, and to vote against H.R. 400.
