Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 40th Anniversary of the Jamaican Social Club of Toledo, Ohio. I was pleased to join in the celebration of the milestone anniversary in our community.  Since 1976, the Jamaican Social Club has served northwest Ohio and southern Michigan as an organization dedicated to charity, education, social and scientific purposes. Since its inception, the Jamaican Social Club has promoted a better understanding and cooperation among all cultures and citizens in the region.  Almost one year after being founded as a non-profit, multicultural organization in the State of Ohio, the Hon. Harry Kessler, Mayor of the City of Toledo at the time, proclaimed the first week in August ``Jamaican Independence Week'' and called upon citizens of Toledo to join the organization in celebration.  The Jamaican Social Club has given consistently of its time and talents over the past 40 years and has donated hundreds of volunteer hours each year to assist those in need. For example, at the devastation of Hurricane Gilbert in Jamaica, the Jamaican Social Club, through its support from General Mills, donated one trailer load of cereals to hurricane victims in Jamaica. Two truck-loads of hospital beds and equipment, donations by Toledo area hospitals, were shipped to two hospitals in Jamaica.  In addition, athletic uniforms and equipment, books and pencils have been donated to several schools in Jamaica, including four computers, which were donated to Trench Town School in Kingston and one to Harry Watch School in Manchester, Jamaica.  Over the years, several scholarships have been awarded to high school students in the Toledo area for excellent achievement, and the organization sponsors a ``Dreams for Teens'' TV talent show designed to enhance students with exceptional ability to perform competitively. Winners of this talent competition are offered prizes and scholarships.  Periodic donations are made to Toledo's homeless shelters as well.  The Jamaican Social Club serves as a liaison between the Citizens of Toledo and its authorities and the people and Government of Jamaica, and offers assistance to newly arrived immigrants to get adjusted in their communities.  The Jamaican Social Club has hosted several Jamaican diplomats as well as many other guests from Jamaica; Toronto, Canada; Baltimore, MD; New York, NY; and Indianapolis. IN; to the city of Toledo.  We offer our heartiest congratulations to the Jamaican Social Club for its rich history and wonderful contributions to our region over the last 40 years.                          ____________________
