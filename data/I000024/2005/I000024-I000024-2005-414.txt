President, first, I thank the distinguished chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee for allowing me to offer these amendments. I will stay within a timeframe that will allow other speakers under the UC to be heard. I have three amendments I will be bringing up.  I first ask unanimous consent that Senator Collins be added as a cosponsor to amendment No. 1312 and that Senator Kyl be added as a cosponsor to amendment No. 1313.
