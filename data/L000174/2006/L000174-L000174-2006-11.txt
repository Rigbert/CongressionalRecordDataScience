President, I would like to take this opportunity to commend GEN James L. Jones and to congratulate him on his retirement. General Jones has served this country through landmark events, including the Cold War and September 11, with consistent skill and with dedication, energy and intelligence. The country has greatly benefited from his service, and his clear-eyed counsel will be greatly missed.  I have known Jim Jones for almost 30 years. I was immediately impressed with his calm manner and obvious intellect when I first encountered him as a major in the Senate's Marine Corps liaison office. I had heard of his distinguished background to that point, which included service in Vietnam, where he earned a Silver Star, and years as a company commander, motivating his marines with his steadfastness.  Over the years, I, along with all of my colleagues in the Senate, have watched Jim Jones grow into a stellar leader. There are two sides to military service--the field operations and the administrative side. While each presents its own challenges, both are absolutely essential to a strong Marine Corps. Jim Jones has been simply superb in both roles.  I remember encountering then Colonel Jones in northern Iraq after the first gulf war during Operation Provide Comfort, which sought to provide food and supplies to the Kurds. At one point, I accompanied him into the town of Zaku. While you would think that this would be one of the more dangerous places, with multitudes of refugees and harassing Iraqi forces, I must admit I have never felt safer as Marine helicopter gunships, Air Force A-10s, and well-orchestrated groups of marines provided cover. General Jones was utterly comfortable, and completely confident, in that environment.  Yet he was just as at home in the conference rooms at Corps Headquarters, at the Pentagon, and walking the historic Halls of Congress. Serving as the 32nd Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, General Jones provided remarkable leadership to the Corps before and after the September 11 attacks. The marines under his command took on critical counterterrorist activities, forging strong ties with our special operations forces. General Jones' leadership led to the Marine Corps' successful operations in southern Afghanistan. Always a persuasive advocate for adequate resources for the Corps, he was an equally outstanding contributor to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, where he could only ``partly'' wear his service hat.  For someone with such multifaceted talent, skill and experience, it is little surprise that General Jones performed in equally spectacular fashion in his last, two-pronged position as Commander of U.S. European Command and as the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe. The 14th Supreme Allied Commander, he has encouraged our NATO allies to take on greater military responsibilities outside of Europe, including more leadership in ongoing operations in Afghanistan. His clear, well-spoken manner and obvious credibility have made General Jones an invaluable asset.  Through it all, General Jones has had no greater partner, confidant, and friend than his wife Diane. The commitment that they have shown in the good and bad times, to their children and to all who know them, is simply remarkable, and it is inspiring.  I join with my wife Marcelle, my fellow Vermonters, and all Americans in expressing our deep thanks to General Jones and his family. We owe this outstanding American, great marine, and dedicated representative of the verybest aspects of our Nation, a debt of gratitude that can never be repaid.                          ____________________
