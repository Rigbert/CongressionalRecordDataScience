 President, today I rise to support a United Nations Democracy Caucus to address questions that underlie a countless number of our foreign policy decisions, particularly in today's climate:  How can the United States be more effective in advancing our foreign policy priorities?  How can we be more active in collaborating with our allies on issues of common concern?  How can we be more productive in promoting the values upon which this nation was founded and getting our message across to those around the world who look to us for leadership?  Three years ago, in Warsaw, Poland, the United States took a step to address these questions when it became one of eight convening countries of the ``Community of Democracies,'' a network of representatives of over 100 nations that meets every 2 years to promote the advancement of global democracy and human rights.  Two years later, in Seoul, Korea, many of these countries reaffirmed their commitment to collaborating with one another and agreed to work together in existing international and regional organizations.  Hence, the idea of establishing a ``democracy caucus'' within the United Nations began to take form.  The idea is simply this: democratic nations share common values, and should work together at the United Nations to promote those values.  A simple notion that, in my view, makes extraordinary sense.  What has happened in the last several years is that support for the establishment of a democracy caucus in the United Nations has begun to take root among foreign policy experts in the United States.  Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has endorsed the idea, as has Jeane Kirkpatrick, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.  In addition, it has been endorsed by a broad-based coalition of organizations and advocacy groups like Freedom House, Human Rights Watch, the American Jewish Committee, the American Bar Association and the Council for Community of Democracies.  In recent months, even senior Bush administration officials have expressed interest in the establishment of a democracy caucus--recognizing that the United States would be more effective if we were to work together and organize with other like-minded countries.  Assistant Secretary of State for International Organizations, Kim Holmes, recently deemed a U.N. democracy caucus as ``an idea whose time has arrived''.  Working together with like-minded nations is a logical and practical way to conduct foreign policy. We build coalitions in the Senate. We build coalitions in Congress. And it makes sense to build coalitions in the United Nations, not only for the sake of forging common positions on issues of mutual concern, but also to provide a counterbalance to other coalitions that are well organized in the United Nations, but do not necessarily share our goals.  The 115-member nonaligned movement (NAM) is an example. Last year, an Independent Task Force co-sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations and Freedom House argued that ``the United States is frequently outmaneuvered and outmatched at the UN'' because the cooperative work of the NAM ``binds the organization's many democratic nations to the objectives and blocking tactics of its remaining tyrannies.''  A democracy caucus would give us a new and potentially effective tool within the United Nations to counter coalitions that act in a manner inimical to our interests.  So today I am submitting a resolution promoting the establishment of a democracy caucus within the United Nations.  The resolution is straightforward: it expresses the support of this Congress for a U.N. democracy caucus and outlines the vision that I, and others, have of what such a caucus would do, and how it would go about doing it.  The general idea is that a democracy caucus would convene at the U.N. General Assembly, the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, and other U.N. bodies on a regular basis.  Members of the democracy caucus would work together to forge common positions to bolster democracy and democratic principles, advance human rights, and fight terrorism.  Furthermore, this bill also talks about who will join a democracy caucus.  We need to establish a criteria for which countries would be considered democracies, and which would not. Fortunately, we are not starting from scratch.  The Community of Democracies forum has established such criteria by drawing on major principles of international law and international standards set forth in the U.N. Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  Drawing up this criteria was a collaborative process during the First Ministerial of the community of Democracies, and the guidelines have been effective in laying the foundation and advancing the goals of the forum.  Therefore, this legislation models the U.N. democracy caucus' eligibility criteria on that already established by and for the Community of Democracies.  I envision that the U.N. democracy caucus would advocate that states that are deemed to be gross violators of human rights, sponsors of terrorist activities, or subjects of United Nations sanctions, not be elected to leadership positions in the United Nations General Assembly or other United Nations bodies.  This issue has received, and deservedly so, much attention this year--particularly after Libya was elected to serve as chair of the Commission of Human Rights.  In my view, the credibility of U.N. institutions is undermined when the members of its bodies--and particularly those in leadership positions--fall into this camp of bad actors.  According to the Freedom House 2003 survey, of the world's 192 governments, 63 percent of them have an electoral democracy form of government.  Furthermore, in the 2002 meeting of the Community of Democracies in Seoul, 118 nations were invited to participate, based upon their commitment to shred democratic values.  These numbers tell us that a democracy caucus within the U.N. would have a strong base from which to begin its work; it could be robust from its inauguration.  At the First Ministerial Conference of the Community of Democracies in Warsaw, Poland, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said, ``When the United Nations can truly call itself a community of democracies, the charter's noble ideals of protecting human rights and promoting `social progress in larger freedoms' will have been brought much closer.''  In that spirit, I submit a resolution in support of the establishment of a U.N. democracy caucus.                          ____________________
