 President, I want to let all Senators know that we have made tremendous progress on the transportation and housing bill. We intend to make more progress next week. We are going to stay in morning business this afternoon. We have a few issues we are working out through the weekend. We will be back at this next week.  I wish to thank all of the Members who have worked very hard with us this week, and I look forward to working with them again next week.
