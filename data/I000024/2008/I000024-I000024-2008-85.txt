President, there have been several companies, organizations, unions, and environmental groups that have come out against this bill by sending letters urging Senators to vote no on the legislation. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record these letters signed by the following groups:       Duke Energy, National Association of Manufacturers, U.S.      Chamber of Commerce, United Auto Workers, Farm Bureau, and      the United Mine Workers of America.
