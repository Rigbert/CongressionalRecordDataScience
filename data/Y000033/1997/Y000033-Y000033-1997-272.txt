Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to offer legislation on amendments to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act to make certain clarifications to the land bank protection provisions, and for other purposes. Last year, the House passed H.R. 2505, however, the U.S. Senate did not consider this legislation in the 104th Congress.  This legislation is identical to H.R. 2505 from the 104th Congress. The Alaska Federation of Natives, the State of Alaska, the administration and members and staff of the Committee on Resources have spent the last year and a half to reach a consensus with noncontroversial provisions.  For example, the bill would amend ANCSA to correct an inconsistency in current Federal law by allowing Regional Corporations to elect to acquire oil, gas, and coal estates reserved to the Federal Government beneath Native allotments surrounded or adjacent to subsurface lands conveyed to the Corporations pursuant to section 12 (a) of (b) of ANCSA.  Another provision would extend the exemption period from estate and gift tax for stock through its period of inalienability.  This bill would also amend ANILCA to extend the automatic land protections to land trades between village corporations, intraregional corporation land trades and Native Corporation land trades with the Federal or State governments.  Mr. Speaker, I offer this bill at this time to begin the process of reviewing each of these important provisions and others which affect Alaskans. I welcome comments on this important bill to ensure that we pass a noncontroversial bill at a later date.                          ____________________
