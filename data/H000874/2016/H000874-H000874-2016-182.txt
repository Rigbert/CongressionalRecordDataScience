Speaker, I rise to join my Maryland colleagues in paying tribute to the life and memory of Officer First Class Jacai David Colson, who fell in the line of duty on Sunday.  Officer Colson was twenty-eight years old and had served with the Prince George's County Police Department for four years. He lost his life responding courageously to an attack by a gunman on the District Three police station in Landover, Maryland. He did what he and his brothers and sisters in law enforcement have been trained to do: run toward gunfire in an attempt to save lives and protect bystanders and their fellow officers.  Officer Colson is a hero, and our thoughts and prayers are with his family and his fellow officers. His father, James Colson, called his son `courageous' and `an excellent role model.' Officer Colson's high school football coach cited his extraordinary character and how he `treated everyone with respect.'  Originally from Delaware County, Pennsylvania, Officer Colson followed in the footsteps of his grandfather, who served on the Upper Chichester Township police force in Delaware County for more than four decades. Prince George's County was fortunate to have Officer Colson on the force, and he left a lasting impression on so many people both here in Maryland and back home in Pennsylvania.  I join with my Maryland colleagues in mourning this tragic loss and honoring Officer Jacai Colson for his service to our Prince George's County communities, to the State of Maryland, and to our country.                          ____________________
