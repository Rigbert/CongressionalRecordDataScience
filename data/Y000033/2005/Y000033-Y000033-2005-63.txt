Mr. Chairman, it is well established under current law that foreign workers may work on U.S. flag vessels on international voyages to conduct various non-watchstanding functions. These personnel are not considered seamen. This amendment will confirm the legality of this practice.  Also, the amendment clarifies that personnel must possess a transportation security card, when required under the Maritime Transportation Security Act, and I urge Members to support this amendment.
