  The recent editorial in the Washington Post on the rape of ethnic minority women and girls by Burmese military officials is heartbreaking and horrific. It is by no means a stretch to characterize the junta's mismanagement and oppression of the people of Burma as a ``reign of terror.''  I join my colleagues in both the Senate and House who have called for justice for these heinous crimes, and for continued pressure on the illegitimate regime in Burma to relinquish power to the sole legitimate representative of the people of Burma, the National League for Democracy. As the editorial rightly states ``Burma's leaders cannot bring the criminals to justice because they are the criminals.''  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the editorial ``The Rape of Burma'' be printed in the Record following my remarks.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, July 23, 2002]                           the Rape of Burma       Recent events have led some people to predict that one of      the world's most repressive regimes may be growing a bit less      so. The generals who rule, or misrule, the Southeast Asian      nation of Burma, which they call Myanmar, released from house      arrest the woman who should in fact be the nation's prime      minister, Aung San Suu Kyi. They have allowed her to travel a      bit, and they have released from unspeakable prisons a few of      her supporters. Grounds for hope, you might think.       Then came release of a report, documented in horrifying      detail, of how Burma's army uses rape as a weapon of war. The      rapes take place as part of the junta's perpetual--and,      outside Burma, little-noticed--war against ethnic      nationalities, in this case in Shan state. The Shan Human      Rights Foundation and Shan Women's Action Network documented      173 incidents involving 625 girls and women, some as young as      five years old, taking place mostly between 1996 and 2001.      Most of the rapes were perpetrated by officers, in front of      their men, and with utmost brutality; one-quarter of the      victims died.       What is telling is the response of the regime to the      report. Rather than seeking to     bring the criminals to justice, it has unleashed vitriol      against the human rights organizations, accusing them of      drug-running and the like. This is the junta's usual pattern,      whenever it is found to be scraping the bottom of the      morality barrel: child labor, forced labor, torture. It      denies all and attacks the truth-tellers. Yet, over the years      the evidence of barbarity has been so inescapable that even      the junta's would-be friends have found it impossible to      overlook it. Burma's leaders cannot bring the criminals to      justice because they are the criminals.       Later this month Secretary of State Colin Powell will      travel to the region for meetings with senior officials.      Earlier this month he instructed his diplomats to express      outrage over the reported use of rape as a tactic of war; he      should personally express the same outrage. He also should      make clear that Aung San Suu Kyi--whose democratic party won      an overwhelming victory in 1990 elections that the junta      nullified--should be permitted more room to maneuver:      permission to publish a newspaper, for starters. The Burmese      regime should not receive rewards for cosmetic      liberalization.                          ____________________
