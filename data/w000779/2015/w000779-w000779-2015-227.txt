President, I urge colleagues to oppose this amendment. What Senator Cornyn seeks to do is to strike an idea that originally camefrom the Heritage Foundation. If it is adopted, sick people will definitely sign up, healthy people will stay on the sidelines, premiums will skyrocket, according to the Congressional Budget Office, by as much as 20 percent, and start then what amounts to a death spiral for the affordability of American health care.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.
