Speaker, we haven't built a new refinery since 1976. EPA will not allow new refineries to be built. We have spent instead billions of dollars to expand the refineries that we have.  Under regular order we moved this Keystone pipeline last summer. It passed on the House floor two-to-one. There is no reason why a construction project like this shouldn't be in this bill. I look forward to the passage of this bill later this afternoon with the inclusion of the Keystone XL pipeline.
