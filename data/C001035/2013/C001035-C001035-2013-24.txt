His amendment is a very important amendment. What it simply says is that if an organization is exempt from ENDA for religious reasons, then government cannot turn around and somehow retaliate against this employer based on his claiming or her claiming a legitimate religious exemption as provided by ENDA. That means that if the business or organization is entitled to compete for certain grants or contracts from the Federal, State or local government, that there cannot be this subtle discrimination against the employer for claiming the religious exemption, legitimately conferred, upon the business under ENDA.  I think that is really important. We do not want retaliation or discrimination or unfair treatment on either side. I commend Senator Portman for coming forward with this amendment. I believe that it is consistent with the bill and that it strengthens the bill.  I congratulate him for his initiative. It has been a pleasure to work with him, Senator Ayotte, and other Members of the Senate in support of this initiative.                               ObamaCare
