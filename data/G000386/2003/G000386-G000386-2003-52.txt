 The intent of the conference report is to recognize that different Medicare Advantage plans are organized in different ways to deliver the new Part D prescription drug benefit and the benefits of the Medicare-endorsed drug discount card.  The conferees understand that Medicare members of some Medicare Advantage plans fill their prescription in retail pharmacies and others in a plans' own pharmacies. For Medicare beneficiaries that will be using retail pharmacies to fill their prescriptions, the conferees understand that the prices negotiated between the prescription drug plan or the Medicare Advantage plan plus dispensing-related costs include the pharmacies' reasonable overhead costs.  Similarly, it is the conferees' intention that Medicare Advantage plans whose Medicare members do not use retail pharmacies, but instead fill their prescriptions at the plan's pharmacies be reimbursed for the costs they incur in delivering the benefit when reimbursed for the same types of costs.                              section 507
