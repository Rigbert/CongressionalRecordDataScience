As the gentleman will recall, I would remind the House, Mr. Speaker, the budget that we passed provided for baseline spending for four items, that is to say, that the baseline which is, essentially, the premise that I think your party has adopted with respect to tax legislation, that the estate tax, the alternative minimum tax, the middle income tax cuts and the so-called ``doc fix,'' the sustainable growth rates, would be scored at baseline, which means effectively you would not pay for them.  And I would expect us to comply with that budget provision, giving those four exceptions of which the estate tax is one.
