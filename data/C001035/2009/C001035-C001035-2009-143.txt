. Chamber of Commerce has issued a letter strongly urging a ``yes'' vote on cloture on the Nelson-Collins amendment.  I am going to put a copy of that letter on my colleagues' desk. But I do ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                               Chamber of Commerce                              of the United States of America,                                 Washington, DC, February 9, 2009.     To the Members of the United States Senate:       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce urges you to support cloture      on the Collins-Nelson amendment to H.R. 1, the ``American      Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.'' The Chamber also      renews its call that the Senate approve H.R. 1 without delay      so that the House and Senate can expeditiously complete work      on a conference report that provides timely, targeted, and      temporary economic stimulus.       The Chamber recognizes that the evolving legislation is not      perfect, but believes that it is vital that Congress quickly      approve legislation to assist the crumbling U.S. economy. The      Chamber strongly supports cloture on the Collins-Nelson      amendment, which will refine H.R. 1 and, most importantly,      allow the legislative process to proceed. Overall, the      Chamber supports many of the pro-growth tax initiatives in      the bill, as well as spending-side provisions to provide      stimulus, create jobs and to get Americans back to work.       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business      federation representing more than three million businesses      and organizations of every size, sector, and region, looks      forward to working with the Senate, House and the      Administration to accomplish meaningful economic stimulus      legislation that can be signed into law in the coming days.           Sincerely,                                              R. Bruce Josten,                                         Executive Vice President,                                               Government Affairs.
