President, while the Senator is thinking over his offer, and he will yield without losing his right to the floor, during the few moments when the Senator from Utah was otherwise engaged on the Senate floor and I discussed this with him, I made a suggestion that we actually accept both the amendments--the amendment of the Senators from Tennessee and Missouri and the amendment that the Senator from Iowa would have--knowing that it goes to conference, where the distinguished Senator from Utah will be the Chair, I will be the ranking member from the Senate. This whole issue is going to have to be revisited in conference, anyway. I can guarantee from my experience that it will be different from the other body.  I suggest that as a possible way out. I have a couple of reasons for doing that: No. 1, with 25 years experience, it is a pragmatic way to do it; secondly, this is the juvenile justice bill. Earlier this afternoon, I was speaking about crimes against senior citizens. If we stay on this much longer, the juveniles we are talking about today will be senior citizens that we may want to protect tomorrow.  I would like to bring this to an end. We have an agreement. I think there will be time agreements on anything left. The distinguished Senator from Utah and I are going to very soon propose a package of managers' amendments that wipes out a lot of the deadwood and perhaps we could go forward.  I throw that suggestion out again. I know the Senator from Tennessee said he would not find that acceptable, and of course he, as any Senator, has an absolute right--the Senator from Missouri, as any other Member, has an absolute right to have a vote one way or the other on their amendment or in relation to it.  However, I ask the Senators that they might want to consider that.
