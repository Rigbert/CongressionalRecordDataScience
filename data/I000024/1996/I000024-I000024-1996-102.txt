The two resolutions that I asked to be inserted into the Record are Senate Joint Resolution 41, which was in the 103d Congress, first session, and Senate Joint Resolution 1, which is what we voted on yesterday, which are identically the same. I do not want the ones from 1993, 1989, or any other time. I want these two.
