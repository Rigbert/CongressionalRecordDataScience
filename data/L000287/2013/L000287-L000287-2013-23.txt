Speaker, I rise today to recognize National Nurses Week. I am proud to honor the tireless work of the more than three million men and women who form the core of the American healthcare system.  Nurses are at the forefront of patient care in our hospitals and clinics, our schools and workplaces, in the military, and throughout our communities. They handle the daunting responsibility of caring for millions of unique patients with unparalleled grace. From bedside care to university classrooms, nurses are the leaders in promoting and maintaining our Nation's health. As equal parts caretakers, advocates, researchers, and educators, nurses work selflessly to protect the safety and well-being of all Americans. They are truly some of our Nation's most devoted professionals.  As our population ages, and our healthcare industry focuses increasingly on preventative care, the demand for nursing services will be greater than ever. We must do everything we can to support nursing students, and ensure that our healthcare system is able to meet growing patient needs for years to come.  Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring nurses across the country. We should all be tremendously grateful for their invaluable work, not just this week, but every day of the year.                          ____________________
