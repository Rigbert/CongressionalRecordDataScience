President, I rise today to introduce the Savage Rapids Dam Act of 2003, for myself and my friend and colleague from Oregon, Senator Gordon Smith.  This legislation is another good example of the Oregon way: bringing together varied interests to get win-win results for all stakeholders. Born out of controversy concerning the detrimental effects of the Savage Rapids Dam on fish passage and survival, this legislation is now supported by the Grants Pass Irrigation District, Waterwatch, Oregon's Governor, TroutUnlimited, and various Oregon river guide and sport fishing concerns.  This legislation simply authorizes the Secretary of Interior, acting through the Bureau of Reclamation, and the Secretary of Commerce, acting through National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries, to undertake activities identified for Federal implementation, including construction, in accordance with U.S. District Court Consent Decree ``United States, et al., v. Grants Pass Irrigation District, Civil No. 98-3034-HO'', August 27, 2001.  This legislation has been years in the making. Senator Smith and I introduced a related measure in the 106th Congress. As we return to this legislation in the 108th Congress, I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and the stakeholders at home to make this legislation and this process work for the Grants Pass Irrigation District and the environment.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1308       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SEC. 1. AUTHORIZATION TO PARTICIPATE IN IMPLEMENTATION OF                    CONSENT DECREE.       The Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Bureau of      Reclamation, and the Secretary of Commerce, acting through      National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries,      are hereafter authorized to implement, and enter into      financial assistance or other agreements as may be necessary      to undertake activities identified for Federal implementation      (including construction) in accordance with U.S. District      Court Consent Decree ``United States, et al., v. Grants Pass      Irrigation District, Civil No. 98-3034-HO'' (August 27, 2001)     SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be      necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act.                                 ______                                       By
