Mr. Speaker, in honor of the 38th celebration of Earth Day, I would like to take this time to reflect on the progress we are making for the health of our planet--and to challenge all Americans--each and every one of us--to re-dedicate ourselves to living in a sustainable manner.  Looking back, we can be proud that the New Direction Congress has made real progress toward a future of cleaner energy and healthier living.  Last year, Congress passed the historic Energy Independence and Security Act.  This legislation takes important steps to increase fuel efficiency, help promote alternative energy sources, and is set to dramatically reduce CO2 emissions over the years to come. However, we can do more. We must do more. The time is now. We cannot wait any longer to address the countless environmental challenges we must confront.  Together, we can leave our planet a little greener and a little more peaceful. It is our duty to help spur the next generation of energy technology--solar, hydrogen, wind, and other sources of energy that create a sustainable environment.  The U.S. has the technology and know-how to lead the world in environmental solutions. I believe we can strengthen America's economy through environmentally sound policy and, in the process, create jobs here at home.  As we commemorate this Earth Day ask yourself, am I doing enough? Can I do more? What kind of planet will we leave for the next generation?  We all must share this planet. We all rely on its resources to survive. We must all do our part to pass along a healthy and sustainable living environment to our children and grandchildren.
