President, I will be brief, no more than 5 minutes.  I will just say, I listened to the Senator's remarks. I know the Senator has gone through some personal trials and tragedies in his family. I am aware of that. And I respect the Senator for not only his strength, but for that of his wife and all his family in enduring these trials. Many of our families have been through similar trials.  I will tell you--and I am sure you will not be surprised; and I bet you will identify with this--some of the most heartening things I do are my visits to children's hospitals and seeing these parents, many of whom have children with serious health problems, who show such courage and such determination. It is a miracle to watch them and to see a child finally survive and prosper, as this beautiful little girl whose portrait the Senator brought to the floor.  It is a testament to God and a testament to the strength of the people who just do not give up when their children are at stake. I think that is the right thing to do. God has blessed me and my wife with three great kids, and a grandson to boot.  I will tell you, though, it troubles me that we end this debate on a day when we had a chance to offer across America health insurance to pregnant mothers who have no health insurance, so that they could have the best chance to give birth to a healthy baby, that we had that chance earlier in Senator Patty Murray's and Senator Harry Reid's amendment--a chance to offer them health insurance. That amendment was defeated. It was defeated on a 49 to 47 vote. Three Republicans joined us in voting for the amendment.  I do not understand this: To have such depth of feeling and emotion for children, to have the medical resources to turn out like this beautiful little girl, and then to vote against that amendment; to vote against an amendment which offered health insurance. How can you possibly rationalize that we would have such determination to provide these medical resources, and when Members were given a chance today, they voted no. They voted no.  I believe this admiration, this strength of families, particularly of the ones I visit in hospitals, has to be put in context. These families have hope because they have access to the great hospitals, the great minds, the great doctors, medicine, and technology. Think of the despondency of the family with a sick child and no health insurance, nowhere to turn, begging--begging--in an emergency room for just any attention whatsoever.  So I would say my belief is that a commitment to family, a commitment to children, goes beyond the abortion issue. It goes to the basic issues of health care and health insurance. We had a chance today with the Murray amendment to do something about it. Sadly, we failed.  I hope another day will come. I hope those who opposed it today saying, oh, it wasn't in the budget, and we are going to save that for the budget resolution debate, will say the same thing next week when the budget resolution comes to the floor. I hope they will join me and others and show that this commitment to kids, this commitment to parents, this commitment to hope goes beyond the debate on abortion.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
