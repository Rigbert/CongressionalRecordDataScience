President, it is my understanding we have 15 minutes equally divided. I ask the Chair, after 6 minutes has elapsed, to advise me.  First, let me say there is nothing new to the problem we have had in this country by not having an energy policy. I can remember when Don Hodel was Secretary of Energy and later Secretary of the Interior. We had a dog-and-pony show where we went around the country during the Reagan administration and tried to talk about how serious this was--the fact that our dependence upon foreign countries, or our ability to fight a war, was not an energy problem, it was a national security problem.  We found the message didn't sell. I was critical of the Reagan administration. Later on, when the first Bush administration came along, I thought, surely, out of the oil patch he would want to have an energy policy, but he didn't either. And during the Clinton administration, he did not. When the second George Bush came into office, the first thing he did was say we are going to have an energy policy. Keep in mind that our dependency at that time, when I was active around the country with Don Hodel, was 36 to 37 percent. Now we are up to twice that. It is much worse now than it was before.  We are in the middle of our second gulf war and people should realize what a threat this is. I chair the Environment and Public Works Committee, which has most of the jurisdiction over many energy issues, and certainly the air issues. I remember making every effort to get drilling on ANWR.
