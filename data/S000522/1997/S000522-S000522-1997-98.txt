I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me, Mr. Chairman.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Diaz amendment to the Miller amendment. Cuba is one of the few countries in the world in which the struggle against totalitarianism has not yet been won. Because of the proximity of Cuba to the United States and the historical close relationship between the peoples of our two nations, it is especially important that this victory come sooner rather than later.  In evaluating all proposed legislation, in evaluating all administrative action and diplomatic initiatives with respect to Cuba, it is important to keep several principles in mind.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The time of the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Diaz-Balart] has expired.
