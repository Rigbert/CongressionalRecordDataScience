 President, I rise to pay tribute to an honored Kentuckian who, sadly, has been lost to us after a long and fruitful life. The man I speak of is Dr. John M. Smith Jr. of Beattyville, KY. Born in Hazard, KY, in 1922, he passed away on June 15 of this year. He was 91 years old.  Dr. Smith was revered in his community as a man of medicine. In the 1940s, he was one of the first recipients of the Rural Kentucky Medical Scholarship Fund, and graduated from the University of Louisville School of Medicine in 1949. He has worked in Morehead, Lexington, Woodford County, and most of all in Beattyville, where he served as a general practitioner for 38 years until the age of 90. Generations of Beattyville-area Kentuckians knew and loved Dr. Smith as their primary-care doctor.  Dr. Smith also proudly served his country in both World War II and the Korean War. In 1942, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy and served in both the Atlantic and Pacific campaigns of World War II. He then volunteered to serve as a medical officer at the Louisville, KY, recruiting station during the Korean War.  Dr. Smith received many accolades and recognitions from his community, and will be missed by a great many beloved family members and friends, including his wife of 54 years, Patty. Elaine and I send our thoughts and prayers to the Smith family for their loss. And I know my colleagues in this U.S. Senate join me in recognizing the long and accomplished life of service led by Dr. John M. Smith Jr.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the obituary for Dr. Smith that appeared in the Lexington Herald-Leader be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the obituary was ordered to appear as follows:           [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, June 18, 2013]                          John Smith: Obituary       Beattyville.--Dr. John M.
