Speaker, today I proudly recognize Captain Andrea Kaman of the United States Army for her extraordinary dedication to duty and service to our Nation. Captain Kaman will soon transition from her current assignment as an Army Congressional Liaison in the House of Representatives to attend Army Intermediate Level Education at Ft. Belvoir and return to duty as an Army Human Resources Officer.  A native of Wakonda, South Dakota, Andrea attended the University of Wyoming on an ROTC scholarship, commissioning as a Distinguished Honor Graduate in December of 2007. Captain Kaman has held numerous leadership and staff assignments, including a deployment to Iraq with the 12th Combat Aviation Brigade, and company command in the 369th AG Battalion at Fort Jackson, SC.  In 2016, Andrea joined my staff as a Defense Fellow. Her first-hand knowledge of the military and its culture was a tremendous benefit to my office. She is a thoughtful, intelligent and dedicated leader who quickly became a trusted member of my team. Following her time in my office, Andrea served throughout the 115th Congress as a Congressional Liaison in the United States Army House Liaison Division. As a primary liaison between fifty-seven Congressional Members, their staffs, committees, and the Army, she provided insight and understanding of Army policies, actions, operations, and requirements. Due to her exceptional planning abilities, agility, and attention to detail, Andrea was selected to coordinate numerous high profile engagements on behalf of Army Senior Leaders and to escort Members and staff on over twenty fact-finding and oversight delegations around the world.  Mr. Speaker, it has been an absolute pleasure to work with Andrea during her time as an Army Congressional Liaison Officer in the House of Representatives. On behalf of a grateful Nation, it is my honor to recognize the selfless service and sacrifice of Captain Andrea Kaman, her husband Drew, and their children Elizabeth and Jacoby. I wish them the very best as they continue their journey in the United States Army, in service to our Nation.                          ____________________
