 President, notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday, September 12, the Senate proceed to executive session for consideration of Calendar No. 110, the nomination of Kevin Hassett to be Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. I further ask that there be 20 minutes of debate on the nomination equally divided in the usual form; that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on confirmation with no intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate resume legislative session.
