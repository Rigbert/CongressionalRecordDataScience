Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Let me just say to my friends and colleagues that this is a good amendment, and, on behalf of the majority, we would like to accept it.  I would say very briefly that unless states which are in noncompliance with their nuclear nonproliferation treaty obligations, or which seek to withdraw from the treaty, are forced to give up their peaceful nuclear capabilities legally acquired under the treaty, they can use these to illegally develop nuclear weapons. As was pointed out by my colleague, such states as North Korea and Iran have already used their status as nuclear nonproliferation treaty parties to develop nuclear weapons, and this closes the loophole. It is a good amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield the remainder of the time to the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce).
