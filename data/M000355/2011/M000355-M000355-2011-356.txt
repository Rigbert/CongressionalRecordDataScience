 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Lawrence Elswick for his service to the United States. Mr. Elswick serves as a prime example of a man who truly puts others before himself.  Having spent the majority of his life in the small town of Big Creek, KY, Mr. Elswick has touched the lives of several Kentuckians. Whether he is fixing the plumbing in a neighbor's bathroom or giving away free vegetables from his garden, Lawrence never hesitates when offering a helping hand.  Although Lawrence came from a humble background, he allowed his upbringing to inspire him rather than hold him back. Having grown up as the oldest in a family with 8 children, Lawrence was molded into the leader that he still is today. Furthermore, Lawrence knows what it means to be truly dedicated. He has dedicated his life to serving his church, the people of the Commonwealth, and his country.  Because Lawrence has always selflessly given to others, it came as no surprise when he joined the Army during World War II and willingly risked his life to defend our country. He was among the heroes who bravely fought on Normandy Beach in 1944. At one point in time, Lawrence went missing in action and remained behind enemy lines for a week. It is because of his immense courage and great service to this Nation that I stand here today honoring his achievements. Lawrence has been awarded numerous medals because of his service in the U.S. Army. His collection of medals include the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star, the Combat Infantry Badge, the Good Conduct Medal, the European Theater of Operations Ribbon with four major stars, the Honorable Service Lapel Button, and the Presidential Citation Ribbon. Several of these medals are among the greatest honors that are bestowed upon our men and women in the service.  It is because of Lawrence's strong character, his dedication to his family and friends, and his giving spirit that the Commonwealth of Kentucky is so proud to call him one of our own.  The Appalachian News Express recently published an article commemorating Mr. Lawrence Elswick's service to the Commonwealth of Kentucky andto the Nation, and I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           [From the Appalachian News Express, Mar. 2, 2011]                       Elswick Says He Is Blessed                           (By Nancy M. Goss)       ``I've been here all my life, on this creek,'' says 88-     year-old Lawrence Elswick. ``My dad bought this place back in      1943 when I was in the service. All my kids were born here      but my youngest.''       Lawrence was born Sept. 30, 1922, the oldest of eight      children. He and two brothers, Bill Elswick of Elyria, Ohio,      and Sonny Elswick of London, are the only ones still living.       He attended a one-room school on Meathouse Fork. His dad      taught school for two years and was a deputy clerk for Bessie      Arnold Riddle. He was killed in a mining accident just a few      days after Lawrence returned from the service.       Lawrence Elswick and Rachel Fuller were married Feb. 21,      1942. They had five children: Lawrence Jr. of Meathouse Fork      of Big Creek, Judith Gail Baker (deceased), Connie Sue      Chapnum of Meathouse Fork of Big Creek and Patsy Blackburn      and Madonna Kaye Williamson, both of Stratton Fork of Canada.      They have 12 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren. Rachel      died Aug. 15, 2007.       ``Mom was known countywide for her biscuits,'' Patsy said.      ``And she would cook for anybody who would show up.''       Lawrence's nickname is Curly. He has naturally curly hair,      but admits to getting perms. ``I was black headed,'' he says.      ``They used to call me Dean Martin.''       Lawrence is a World War II veteran.       In the beginning of his Army career, he was stationed in      Mississippi.       ``I was put in the 99th Division, then after my training, I      came to Camp Shanks, New York, and caught a ship--The George      Washington. I was 14 days getting over there, to France.'' He      was then in the 4th Infantry Division. Later, he was also      part of the military police at Fort Campbell.       His medals include The Purple Heart, The Bronze Star,      Combat Infantry Badge, the American Campaign, Good Conduct,      ETO, Ruptured Duck, Presidential Citation Ribbon, four major      battle stars on ETO ribbon, World War II, and Expert      Rifleman.       ``I had a rough life in the service,'' he says. ``I went in      on Normandy Beach. I was missing in action . . . cut off      behind enemy lines for a week.''       ``I got out on Oct. 3, 1945,'' Lawrence says. ``I was      supposed to get out on my birthday, up at Camp Breckinridge.      But they held me in the hospital for three days because I was      a diabetic--the sugar showed up on me, you know.''       ``Dad worked in the mines for a while when he first came      out of the service,'' Patsy said. ``And he's put plumbing and      bathrooms in every house all up and down Meathouse.''       ``I'm one of the best blessed men on Big Creek,'' Lawrence      says. ``I never drew an unemployment check and I never was      cut off from a job in my life. I worked 38 years for the gas      company. I was the maintenance man and worked in four      counties. I was a compressor engineer, is what they called      it. I'd take care of these pump stations.''       Lawrence did plumbing on the side in the evenings while      working for the gas company. He said Al Reed helped him plumb      every house.       ``I'd get him to help me. He was a real nice friend of      mine. Another good friend was Sonny Hall of Pikeville. He was      like a son to me,'' Lawrence said. ``And I can't not mention      Willie B. Thacker and Bethel Thacker. They were just like a      daddy and mother to me.''       Lawrence says he's always been involved in politics.       ``I've been a politician all my life and voted Democrat all      my life. Paul Patton came to my house and sat right down      there in that chair when he started to run for county judge      the first time. And Rick Bartley sat on my porch when he was      running . . . and Ira Branham, and Keith Hall, and Eddy      Coleman and his wife . . .''       ``Dad's friends with all of them,'' Patsy said. I had an      anniversary party for him and mom on their 50th wedding      anniversary and we had over 300 people show up! I was afraid      I would run out of food.''       Many years ago, Lawrence also had about 50 game cocks,      roosters, on strings at one time.       ``That was back before Daddy ever belonged to church . . .      he'd referee. He had a colorful life!'' Patsy said.       ``That was over in McDowell in Floyd County. I was the head      referee over there,'' Lawrence said. ``Now, I'm against it      the worst in the world . . . and I used to do it all the      time.''       Lawrence is a Kentucky Colonel. He's also an ordained      deacon in the Big Creek Primitive Baptist Church. He and      Rachel were baptized in 1996, but attended church long before      that.       ``I love my church,'' Lawrence says. ``There ain't but one      church and one God and he controls all of it. That's the way      I see it. You've got different denominations, but God      controls it all.''       Today, Lawrence lives alone, but Patsy comes everyday to      check on him. She and her husband, Thomas, a Vietnam veteran,      have four children: Jenny Rebecca Hatfield of Stratton Fork,      Thomas Patrick of Columbus, Ohio, Zachary Slade and Rebecca      Cheyenne Webb, both of the home. They have five      grandchildren.       Although he had a stroke in 2002, Lawrence appears to be in      excellent health. lie has a wonderful sense of humor, good      eyesight, still drives, still goes out and ``gins'' and does      favors for neighbors and friends. He works on everything from      lawn mower motors to car engines.       ``I just gin all the time,'' he said. ``And I raise a      garden every year and I give it all away . . . to anybody      that wants it.''       Patsy says people just come and take the vegetables right      out of the garden.       ``And when he gets a lot, he'll take it to the service      station and give it away!'' she says with a laugh.       To echo what Lawrence said earlier, he's ``one of the best      blessed men on Big Creek!''                          ____________________
