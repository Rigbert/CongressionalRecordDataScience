 President, I wish to say a few words about my friend and colleague, Senator Saxby Chambliss.  Saxby, as we all know, is the ultimate southern gentleman. He is a man of his word. He is blessed with the charm and the drawl only a Georgian could possess, and he is far too modest. He shouldn't be. He has a lot to be proud of as he looks back at a storied career here in Congress.  We are talking about one of our Nation's top experts on intelligence and national security. We are talking about a standout champion for the men and women of our military. We are also talking about a Senator who became chair of the Agriculture Committee just 2 years into his first term. That is really quite an accomplishment. But once you get to know Saxby, it isn't all that surprising.  Before he came to Congress, Saxby was a smalltown ag lawyer. He still lives in a rural area--a peanut and cotton-farming region far removed from the bright lights of Atlanta. Saxby has a feel for the issues that could only be acquired from actual on-the-ground experience. He understands the real-world impact of what we discuss here in Washington, and he cares.  On top of that, he has the disciplined work ethic of a minister's son--which makes sense, because he is one. Saxby is usually the first guy to raise his hand when there is an assignment no one else wants. That is what we saw for him on the Gang of 6, a politically difficult and work-intensive committee if there ever was one.  But Saxby came here to get things done--not to posture. He takes on projects with the kind of drive and courage we don't often see.  How courageous is Saxby? Well, he accepted an invitation to go quail hunting with Vice President Cheney, and he lived to tell the tale. The senior Senator from South Carolina remembers the trip very well. He had to be persuaded by Saxby to come. He still suspects that Saxby's real motive was to give Cheney a second target.  It wasn't the only time Saxby cheated death with the Vice President. Lindsey recalls a meeting in Baghdad with Saxby, Joe Biden, and the Iraqi Prime Minister. Afterward, they boarded a plane and came under fire. Here is what Saxby said: ``I guess the meeting didn't go that well.''  So Saxby is a comedian. But he is also courageous. He is also persuasive. He is really good at getting his way. It is kind of what we would expect from a former door-to-door fruitcake salesman. After hawking loaves of spiced dough, there is not much Saxby can't sell at this point.  We know he was persuasive enough to convince Julianne to marry him. Saxby and Julianne met at the University of Georgia. She was Sigma Chi's pledge-class sweetheart--and she soon became Saxby's sweetheart. The Chamblisses have been inseparable ever since.  Now, just in case Saxby ever becomes his own category on Jeopardy, here is an interesting piece of trivia. The president of the same pledge class became Saxby's Democrat challenger in 2008. The two fraternity brothers are still friendly. Here is how this gentleman remembered Saxby from college. He said he ``looked old.''  Well, Julianne fell for him anyway, and it is a good thing she did. This former schoolteacher is better than anyone at keeping him centered, and she has even taught students who would go on to serve on Saxby's staff. So it is really quite a partnership. Saxby says that the most significant moment of his life is when he met Julianne.  That is really something when we consider how much he loves golf. Last year, Saxby sank a hole in one squaring off against the leader of the free world--that is, the President of the United States. He has a signed flag to prove it.  But golf is more than just a hobby for Saxby. It is a way to get things done. More than most people around here, he understands the value of relationships. He is good at whipping votes and picking up intel from both ends of the Capitol. He works across the aisle, and he is unafraid to stand up when something needs to be said.  That is the thing about Saxby. He doesn't say a lot, but when he does, you know it is significant. You know there is a lot of careful thought behind it.  Saxby is a serious legislator who approaches his role as vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee in that frame. Saxby learns things on that committee that would keep anyone up at night. It is a grave responsibility. But Saxby is perfectly suited to it. He has always stood proudly in defense of our Nation.  We are going to miss his sharp wit, his integrity, and his judgment.  I know Saxby's staff is going to miss him, too. Some of them have been with him since his days in the House. Well, the Senate's loss is the Chambliss family's gain.  I know Saxby is looking forward to spending more time with Julianne. I know he can't wait to trade the title of Senator for a new one--Big Daddy. It is what his grandkids call him. He can't wait to see more of them. They are the reason he works so hard here--to build a better future for them, for the next generation.  Saxby will have plenty of stories to share when he leaves, such as when he hit that hole in one, when he threw out the first pitch for the Braves, and when he made the cover of Peanut Patriot Magazine.  So Saxby has obviously had a long and interesting career. He deserves some time to focus on his family. We thank him for his dedication to this body and to the people he represents, and we send him every wish for a retirement filled with joy and happiness.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
