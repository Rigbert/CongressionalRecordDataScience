Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule, and I want to make it clear from the outset I am for the term limit that was placed or that was put in place by our Founding Fathers, that is a 2-year term limit. It is called an election.  It seems to me that utilizing their constitutional voting rights, the voters can have and will continue to achieve Thomas Jefferson democracy by throwing the rascals out if they so choose.  What the term limit says basically is the voters, because of many reasons, are not up to this job and should be denied the right to send somebody back.  But the basic point I think is this: If in fact this House of Representatives is in such a crisis to the extent that we must deny the voters the right to reelect their representatives, if in fact the institution is in such a chaotic state that we must arbitrarily take away the right of voters after 6 or 12 years, then surely the people responsible, the guilty parties, are those who are the career politicians who have been here over 12 years and none of the proposed versions really include the retroactive version of term limits with sound policy. It is sort of like there is a terminal illness that abounds in this House but we are going to wait 12 years before we take the medicine.  Why? Well, the why is simple; not many term limiters find it a pleasant task telling experienced Members they are part of the problem and it is time to say adios.  So to me, wrapping yourself in the banner of a counterproductive reform is bad enough but exempting ourselves from these reforms does not represent truth in term limits.
