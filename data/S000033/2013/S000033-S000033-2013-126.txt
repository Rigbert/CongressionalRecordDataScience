 And I often point out to my Republican friends that I think you are looking at yourself and me as some of the major deficit hawks.  Our friends today who want to cut Social Security in the name of deficit reduction apparently didn't have a problem with the deficit when they went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan without paying for those wars and when they gave huge tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country without offsetting those tax breaks.  The Senator's point is very well taken.
