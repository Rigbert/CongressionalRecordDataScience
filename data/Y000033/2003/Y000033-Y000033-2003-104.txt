Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 281, designating the Federal Building and United States Courthouse, located at 200 West 2nd Street, in Dayton, OH, the ``Tony Hall Federal Building and United States Courthouse.''  Born and raised in Dayton, OH, Congressman Hall attended the public schools of Dayton, graduating from Fairmont High School in 1960. He went on to attend Denison University in Granville, OH.  While most Members know that Congressman Hall earned success in the classroom, what many don't know is that he also earned high honors for his work on the gridiron, being named a Little All American as a running back at Denison University.  After graduation, he served in the Peace Corps in Thailand, upon his return he served in both the Ohio House of Representatives and the State Senate before being elected to honorably serve for 12 terms in this body.  While in this body, and as the founder and chairman of the Congressional Hunger Caucus, Congressman Hall aggressively fought to ensure that no person, anywhere, went hungry.  In 2002, Tony Hall accepted a Presidential appointment to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Programs, a post from which he can continue this important work. I join my colleagues in wishing Tony Hall the best of luck in his new position.  I support the legislation, and encourage my colleagues to do the same.
