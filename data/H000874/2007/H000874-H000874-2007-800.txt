Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 107--a bill calling for the immediate and unconditional release of Israeli soldiers being held captive by Hamas and Hezbollah.  On July 12, 2006, Sergeant Udi Goldwasser and fellow soldier Eldad Regev were on patrol inside the Israeli border when their armored humvee was bombarded by Hezbollah rockets. Udi and Eldad were captured during this attack and have been held by Hezbollah militants for more than 8 months.  I tell this story because just over one month ago, I had the pleasure of welcoming Udi Goldwasser's wife, Karnit, to the United States Capitol. She told me about how hard it has been to live without ``the love of her life'' and how her dreams of raising a peaceful and loving family with Udi are now in jeopardy due to the cowardly acts of a terrorist organization that has said it will not rest until her country is destroyed.  Terrorist acts are not military actions between warring nations. They are despicable crimes that rob wives of husbands, husbands of wives and children of their parents. And as the leader of the free and democratic world, it is America's solemn duty to condemn such attacks whenever they occur and to support the justifiable actions of our ally Israel when it comes under heinous, premeditated attacks.  Today, I join Karnit Goldwasser in seeking to further the pursuit of liberty, democracy and peace throughout the world. And it is my sincere hope that Udi, Eldad and every other Israeli captive of Hamas and Hezbollah will be united with their families as soon as is humanly possible.                          ____________________
