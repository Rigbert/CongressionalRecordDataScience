President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of a Senate resolution at the desk which would express the sense of the Senate on the ninth anniversary of the massacre of prodemocracy demonstrators on Tiananmen Square in China. I ask further consent that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.
