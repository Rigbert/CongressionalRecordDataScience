President, the Senate continues to make progress today with what I anticipate will be the confirmation of four more lifetime appointments to the Federal bench. Along with Judge O'Grady's nomination to the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, we consider three nominations for lifetime appointments to the District Court for the Western District of Michigan, those of Janet T. Neff, Paul Lewis Maloney, and Robert James Jonker. All four nominations are for judicial emergency vacancies, and they all have the support of their home State Senators.  I thank Senators Levin, Stabenow, Warner and Webb for their work in connection with these nominations.  It is unfortunate that the three nominees for the Western District of Michigan are not already on the bench helping to ease the backlog of cases in that district. All three were reported out of committee last fall, but were left pending on the Senate's Executive Calendar when some on the other side of the aisle blocked their nominations. All three are for vacancies that are judicial emergency vacancies--three emergencies in one Federal district.
