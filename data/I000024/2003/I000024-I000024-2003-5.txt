President, I stand today to honor the memory of a brave young American who gave his life defending the Nation. He felt a call to serve his country, to be part of something bigger than himself, and ultimately, paid the highest price.  SPEC Dustin K. McGaugh, of Derby, KS, was a firing specialist assigned to the Army's 17th Field Artillery Brigade stationed in Fort Sill, OK. His mother, Marina Hayes, lives in Tulsa, OK, where he graduated from high school in 2001.  On September 30 in Balad, Iraq, he died tragically from a non-hostile gunshot wound. He gave his life for the freedom of millions of Americans, and also for the peace and prosperity of the Iraqi people crippled by a totalitarian regime.  Specialist McGaugh had a heart for the less fortunate. According to his fellow soldiers, he would leave the safety of his Jeep and give candy to the Iraqi children. Imagine an American soldier who truly cared for the least among us, and performed simple acts of kindness to his fellow humans. Imagine an American soldier who represented America with a noble heart, and reminded us all of the freedoms we take for granted. Specialist McGaugh was that soldier.  His compassion is a microcosm of the American spirit, the spirit that drives us to fight oppression around the world. The Iraqi people are an oppressed people, and Specialist McGaugh showed us how our inherent humanity can overcome even the broadest of differences. He refused to sit idly and watch the tyranny in Iraq take place any longer. It is for the sake of these broken, defeated people that Specialist McGaugh risked his life on a daily basis. It is for these people that he gave his life in the end. He was a true American hero.  His twin sister Windy said that her ``kid brother'' became her hero. Specialist McGaugh should not only be his sister's hero, but the Nation's hero as well. He set a high example of what it means to be an American and what it means to be human. It is for men like Specialist McGaugh that I am proud to be a part of this great country. He was a special soldier, but more importantly, a special man.                          ____________________
