Mr. Speaker, I want to call the attention of my colleagues to a very special event that is taking place, the 25th Anniversary of the Close Up Foundation.  As many of you know, the Close Up Foundation is the largest civic education organization in the country. It has not always been that way, when Close Up started 25 years ago their first program included 25 participants from 14 States. Today, Close Up brings approximately 25,000 participants annually to Washington, DC, on their various programs. They have participants from all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Pacific Island territories.  These achievements are of themselves enough to make an organization and those who have supported it very proud; however, it does not stop there. Close Up has remained true to its mission over these 25 years. Their focus has been on efforts to be all inclusive and reach students who are underserved, either because of their economic, cultural, or geographic isolation. I am personally familiar with the difference Close Up has made to those who are geographically isolated.  Since 1979, more than 9,200 Alaska students and educators have participated in Close Up's programs. In 1987, Close Up began an effort to focus on including Alaska Native students in the Washington, D.C. High School Program. Since that time, approximately 685 Alaska Native students have taken part in the Close Up program. These students, from every corner of Alaska including our most remote villages, come to Washington and mix with their peers both from within Alaska and throughout the United States. While they are here, they are able to contribute to as well as learn from the diverse population of Close Up's student participants. By including Alaska Native students, young people, who rarely, if ever, have been outside of their villages, get the opportunity to expand their civic literacy as well as learn about the rest of the country and its citizens. We, in Alaska, are very proud of the input all of our Alaskan students bring to their peers from the rest of the country.  The contribution made by Alaska's students and educators takes many shapes, including returning to Alaska to become involved in and to organize Close Up local programs. These local programs provide civic education opportunities for all members of the community not just those students who were lucky enough to get to Washington, DC, to benefit from the Close Up experience. In this way, the Close Up message of informed, responsible citizenship is multiplied many times over to the great benefit of my State and the country.  In this time of distrust and cynicism, Close Up's program works to break down suspicion and to show high school students that government is relevant to their lives and important to them as citizens. With the recent disturbing results of a study of peoples' public opinion of Congress and the Government, we, as elected officials, should make it our goal to raise student interest in government because the future of this Nation depends on their civic involvement.  As we all know, Close Up's message of civic involvement is directed toward all students, not just the academic elite or the affluent. The federally funded Ellender Fellowship Program, along with Close Up generated fellowship funds, has made the Close Up civic learning opportunity a reality for students who would not otherwise be able to afford a trip to Washington, DC. In Alaska, students from families with limited means face an additional hurdle of very high travel costs. The Ellender fellowships help to level the playing field and provide civic educational opportunities to many students who might otherwise be overlooked or left behind.  Mr. Speaker, I have been a longtime supporter of the Close Up Foundation, and I am delighted to be able to send my heartiest congratulations to them on the celebration of their 25th anniversary. The congratulations are for a job well done, and one I hope will continue for another 25 years.                          ____________________
