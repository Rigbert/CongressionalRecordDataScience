 President, we will all have an opportunity to hear German Chancellor Merkel speak to a joint session of Congress later this morning.  We welcome her to the Capitol. It is always an honor for us to welcome a head of state to this great symbol of democracy in which we all have the privilege to work.  We look forward to hearing Chancellor Merkel's words, and we wish her a very pleasant and productive stay in Washington.                          ____________________
