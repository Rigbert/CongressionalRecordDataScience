Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 476 and all of America's firefighters, especially those who have died in the line of duty.  As a proud Member of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, I think it is fitting and appropriate that we set aside time to pay tribute to our nation's firefighters, men and women who have dedicated their lives so that the rest of us can sleep in peace. The threat of fire and the calamity an actual fire often creates is a day-to-day concern for all our communities, not to mention the added threats of terrorism now confronting us.  In 1992, on behalf of the more than one million firefighters in over 32,000 fire departments nationally, Congress rightly created the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation to lead a nationwide effort to remember our nation's fallen firefighters and their families. Since its creation, this foundation has assisted many family members, helping them overcome the loss of their fallen champions. Within hours of the September 11th tragedy, the foundation established a process that used resources from across the country to provide the critical support that members of the Fire Department of New York City and their families needed.  This weekend the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation will honor the 442 firefighters who made the ultimate sacrifice in service to their communities last year, including those lost in the World Trade Center's disaster. Also to be honored are five firefighters from my state of New Jersey who served with pride and honor and who dedicated their lives to protect others in their communities. Willie Barns, George ``June'' Danielson, Jr., James T. Heenan, Alberto Tirado, and Lawrence James Webb are New Jersey's fallen heros. They will be honored for their ultimate acts of valor this weekend. My prayers and the prayers of New Jerseyans everywhere will be with them and their families.  Madam Speaker, our firefighters and emergency personnel who stand at the ready to protect and help us around the clock deserve our support and dedication. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote YES on H. Con. Res. 476.                          ____________________
