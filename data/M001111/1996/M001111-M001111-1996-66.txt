The maternal and child health block grant provides critical dollars for prenatal care, newborn screening, and care for children with disabilities. It provides for vital resources like parent education, health screenings and immunization, children preventive dental visits, and sudden infant death syndrome counseling.  I am sure my colleagues will agree we should not reduce these vital resources by 13 percent. I have a chart here showing how much that will reduce each State's allocation if you are interested.
