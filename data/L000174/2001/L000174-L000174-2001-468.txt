President, I rise today to introduce legislation, the Artist-Museum Partnership Act, to enable our country to keep cherished art works in the United States and to preserve them in our public institutions, while erasing an inequity in our tax code that currently serves as a disincentive for artists to donate their works to museums and libraries. This is the same bill I introduced last year with my colleagues Senator Bennett and Senator Lieberman. I would like to thank them for their leadership in this area and also to thank Senators Dodd, Cochran, Lincoln, Reid, and Domenici for cosponsoring this bipartisan bill.  In a nutshell, our bill would allow artists, writers and composers who donate works to museums and libraries to take a tax deduction equal to the fair market value of the work. This is something that collectors who make similar donations are already able to do. If we as a nation want to ensure that art works created by living artists are available to the public in the future, for study or for pleasure, it is something that artists should be allowed to do as well. Under current law, artists who donate self-created works are only able to deduct the cost of supplies such as canvas, pen, paper, ink, which does not even come close to their true value. This is unfair to artists and it hurts museums and libraries, large and small, that are dedicated to preserving works for posterity.  In my State of Vermont, we are incredibly proud of the great works produced by hundreds of local artists who choose to live and work in the Green Mountain State. Displaying their creations in museums and libraries helps develop a sense of pride among Vermonters and strengthens a bond with Vermont, its landscape, its beauty and its cultural heritage. Anyone who has gazed at a painting in a museum or examined an original manuscript or composition, and has gained a greater understanding of both the artist and the subject as a result, knows the tremendous value of these works. I would like to see more of them, not fewer, preserved in Vermont and across the country.  Prior to 1969, artists and collectors alike were able to take a deduction equivalent to the fair market value of a work, but Congress changed the law with respect to artists in the Tax Reform Act of 1969. Since then, fewer and fewer artists have donated their works to museums and cultural institutions. The sharp decline in donations to the Library of Congress clearly illustrates this point. Until 1969, the Library of Congress received 15 to 20 large gifts of manuscripts from authors each year. In the four years following the elimination of the deduction, the library received only one such gift. Instead, many of these works have been sold to private collectors, and are no longer available to the general public.  For example, prior to the enactment of the 1969 law, Igor Stravinsky planned to donate his papers to the Music Division of the Library of Congress. But after the law passed, his papers were sold instead to a private foundation in Switzerland. We can no longer afford this massive loss to our cultural heritage. This loss was an unintended consequence of the tax bill that should now be corrected.  More than 30 years ago, Congress changed the law for artists in response to the perception that some taxpayers were taking advantage of the law by inflating the market value of self-created works. Since that time, however, the government has cut down significantly on the abuse of fair market value determinations. Under this legislation, artists who donate their own paintings, manuscripts, compositions, or scholarly compositions, would be subject to the same new rules that all taxpayer/collectors who donate such works must now follow. This includes providing relevant information as to the value of the gift, providing appraisals by qualified appraisers, and, in some cases, subjecting them to review by the Internal Revenue Service's Art Advisory Panel.  In addition, donated works must be accepted by museums and libraries, which often have strict criteria in place for works they intend to display. The institutions must also certify that it intends to put the work to a use that is related to the institution's tax exempt status. For example, a painting contributed to an educational institution must be used by that organization for educational purposes. It could not be sold by the institution for profit. Similarly, a work could not be donated to a hospital or other charitable institution that did not intend to use the work in a manner related to the function constituting the donee's exemption under Section 501 of the tax code. Finally, the fair market value of the work could only be deducted from the portion of the artist's income that has come from the sale of similar works, or related activities.  This bill would also correct another disparity in the tax treatment of self-created works--how the same work is treated before and after an artist's death. While living artists may only deduct the material costs of donations, donations of those same works after death are deductible from estate taxes at the fair market value of the work. In addition, when an artist dies, works that are part of his or her estate are taxed on the fair market value.  Last year, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that our bill would cost $48 million over 10 years. This is a moderate price to pay for our education and the preservation of our cultural heritage. The time has come for us to correct an unintended consequence of the 1969 law and encourage rather than discourage the donations of art works by their creators. This bill could, and I believe would, make a critical difference in an artist's decision to donate his or her work, rather than sell it to a private party, where it may become lost to the public forever.  I want to thank my colleagues again for cosponsoring this bipartisan legislation. I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters from the Association of Art Museum Directors, The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the Theatre Communications Group, Inc., and the Whitney Museum of American Art in support of this bill.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               Whitney Museum of American Art,                                      New York, NY, April 3, 2001.     Senator Patrick Leahy,     Senator Robert Bennett,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Leahy and Bennett: On behalf of the staff and      Board of Trustees of the Whitney Museum of American Art, I      thank you for introducing the ``Artist-Museum Partnership      Act''. This legislation, which would allow artists, writers      and composers to deduct the fair-market value of a      contribution of their own work to a charitable institution,      will benefit museums, and their visitors, across the country.       As a result of changes to the tax code of 1969, visual      artists, writers and composers     can no longer take a deduction based on the fair-market value      of a contribution of their own work. The artists' deduction      is limited to the cost of materials in preparing the work--in      the case of a visual artist, canvas and paint. However, a      collector, making an identical donation, may take the fair-     market value deduction for the work. Once the artist dies,      his or her spouse may donate the work for a fair-market value      deduction. In addition, works of art left to an artist's      estate are evaluated at the fair-market value for purposes of      determining estate taxes.       Since the 1969 repeal, contributions to museum and      libraries by living artists and writers have all but      disappeared, depriving the public of access to its cultural      heritage. Many of these pieces are sold abroad or into      private collections and never seen again.       Thank you again for your continued support of artists and      arts institutions in this country. We are all deeply      appreciative.           Sincerely,     Maxwell L. Anderson.                                  ____                                            Theatre Communications                                                  Group, Inc.,                                      New York, NY, April 4, 2001.     Senator Patrick Leahy,     Senator Robert Bennett,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Leahy and Bennett: On behalf of Theatre      Communications Group--the national service organization for      the American theatre--and the 384 not-for-profit theatres      across the country that comprise our membership and which      present performances to a combined annual attendance of more      than 17 million people, I thank you for introducing the      ``Artist-Museum Partnership Act''. This legislation, which      would allow artists, writers and composers to deduct the      fair-market value of a contribution of their own work to a      charitable institution, is fully supported by Theatre      Communications Group, which endorses its passage.

Senator Patrick Leahy,     Senator Robert Bennett,     U.S. Senate     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Leahy and Bennett: On behalf of the      Association of Art Museum Directors (AAMD), founded in 1916      and representing 170 art museums nationwide, I thank you for      introducing the ``Artist-Museum Partnership Act''. This      legislation, which would allow artists, writers and composers      to deduct the fair-market value of a contribution of their      own work to a charitable institution, is fully supported by      the AAMD, which endorses its passage.       As a result of changes to the tax code of 1969, visual      artists, writers and composers can no longer take a deduction      based on the fair-market value of contribution of their own      work.

Senator Robert Bennett,     Senator Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Bennett and Leahy: On behalf of the Trustees      of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, I would like to express      my appreciation to you for introducing the ``Artist-museum      Partnership Act.'' The legislation is long overdue and will      be useful to museums in soliciting original works of art from      artists. May museums do not have funds to purchase art and      must rely on donations. Since 1969, when the law was repealed      that allowed artists to take a fair-market value deduction,      contributions from living artists to museums has dramatically      decreased.       Many important works by regional or ethnic artists are sold      rather than donated because the majority of artists simply      cannot afford to donate their works when they can only take a      deduction equal to the cost of materials. The bill you have      drafted is an important step in helping small and mid-sized      museums add these works to their collections for the public      to enjoy.       Thank you again for this thoughtful piece of legislation.           Sincerely,                                                  Peter C. Marzio,                                                         Director.
