 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Emerson, IA native Spc. James C. Kearney, III, who lost his life when the military vehicle he was traveling in was struck by a rocket-propelled grenade and small arms fire near Sharan, Afghanistan. Spc. Kearney was assigned to the Iowa Army National Guard Company B, 1st Battalion, 168th Infantry, Air Assault, based in Shenandoah, IA. Spc. Kearney enlisted as an infantryman in 1999 and was mobilized for Operation Enduring Freedom in March 2004. My prayers go out to James's mother and father, Theresa and James Kearney, Jr., as well as his brothers and sister.  In paying tribute to Spc. Kearney, we recognize the efforts of an extraordinary young man who worked to make the world a safer place. The Rev. Ken Gross, a friend of James, describes him as ``. . . a person of character with great determination. He was adventurous, fearless and enjoyed taking risks.'' Spc. Kearney will always be remembered for the good work that he did for his community and for his country. As a soldier and patriot, Spc.James C. Kearney, III has given us a model of true dedication and virtue.                      Specialist Raymond L. White
