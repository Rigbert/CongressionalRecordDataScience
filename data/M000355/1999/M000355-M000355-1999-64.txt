 I think the amendment he and the Senator from Nebraska have offered is a very important step in the direction that I ultimately think we will take--if we ever get serious about doing this on a bipartisan basis, rather than in a way that advantages one side and disadvantages another.  So I wanted to commend the Senator from Michigan for his outstanding work.
