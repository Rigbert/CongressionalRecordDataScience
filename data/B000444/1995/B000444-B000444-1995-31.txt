 If I can expand 60 seconds on the answer, I say to my friend that 30 years ago for every crime committed, every felony committed, there were three cops. Today for every three crimes committed there is one cop. There used to be three cops for every felony committed. Now we have for every cop three felonies committed. Of the 20 largest States in the Nation, if you look at the last 10 years, the increase in their police force is about 1 percent. Even though the populations are growing, the crime wave is growing above that. The 30-to-10 number the Senator suggests I cannot swear is the number, but it is close.
