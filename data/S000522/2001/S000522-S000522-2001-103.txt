Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume just to conclude.  At the end of every movie we always see a list of credits, and they are the people really, not just the director or even the actor or actress that makes that movie, it is that cast of people that really do the nuts and bolts work of any movie. Well, the same goes for legislation. I think every one of us are very well aware how important staff is, and I just want to say how grateful I am to the professionalism and the competence and, above all, the compassion of our very fine staff. It is a bipartisan staff headed up by Pat Ryan, our Chief Counsel and Chief of Staff; John Bradley, Kimberly Cowins, Greg Carmichael, Kingston Smith, Jeannie McNally, Summer Larson, Darryl Kehrer, Paige McManus, Peter Dickenson, Devon Seibert, Jerry Tan and Art Wu, and the ranking member's staff, including Mike Dunishin and Susan Edgerton, all of whom played major roles in crafting this legislation. I want to express my sincerest gratitude.  Mr. Speaker, this truly is a bipartisan bill. We really want to end the horrific tragedy of homelessness for our veterans, end it for everyone, but first and foremost, those who served this country.
