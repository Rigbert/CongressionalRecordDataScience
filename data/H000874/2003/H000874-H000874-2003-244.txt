The leader points out that the Medicare prescription drug bill will be on the floor.  First I would like to know, Mr. Leader, if you know which day of the week or days of the week can we expect to see the Medicare prescription drug bill on the floor?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will yield, I would anticipate that the Medicare bill would probably come later in the week. I cannot give the gentleman a firm time, but I would anticipate either late Wednesday or certainly no later than Thursday.
