Mr. Speaker, today I joined with Rep. Mike Doyle of Pennsylvania and over 60 other Members of the House to introduce a new congressional caucus concerning autism called C.A.R.E., which stands for the Coalition for Autism Research and Education.  As I have said many times before, the parents of children with autism are truly the voices of the voiceless. They are the protectors of those who cannot fend for themselves. For some years now, we have been working to provide help to the parents. But today we have reinforcements. Today we launch a new vehicle through which we can all work towards our common goals.  The Coalition for Autism Research and Education (C.A.R.E.) is a bipartisan Congressional Member Organization (CMO) dedicated to improving research, education, and support services for persons with autism spectrun disorders. I am very proud to be a Co-Chairman of this new organization, and pleased to be working alongside my good friend, and Democrat colleague, Mike Doyle of Pennsylvania (PA-18).  At today's press conference we were also honored to have a special guest, Mr. B.J. Surhoff, a professional baseball player who plays left field for the Atlanta Braves. Many of us know B.J. for his skill and grace on the baseball field. But few of us know that of all the challenges and accomplishments he has faced in his life, probably none are more near and dear to his heart than his son, Mason, who is autistic.  I have always believed that the true value of any society can be seen in how it treats its most vulnerable members. And few are as vulnerable and dependent on others as the autistic child.  A key mission of C.A.R.E. is to expand federal research for autism. The caucus will be working hard to build upon a proven record of accomplishments in the area of autism research during the previous 106th Congress.  During the 106th Congress, we passed landmark legislation which established ``Centers of Excellence'' to track cases of autism, increased funding at the Center for Disease Control (CDC) from $1.1 million in Fiscal Year 2000 to $6.7 million in FY 2001 and boosted funding at the National Institute of Health (NIH) from $40 million in FY 1999 to $45 million in 2000. Another significant increase in autism funding is expected at NIH for FY 2001. Congress also held hearings on autism, which have led to a better understanding of the disorder.  Many of my colleagues who I worked with last year on these issues are enthusiastic members of C.A.R.E., including, Dr. Dave Weldon of Florida, Chairman Dan Burton of Indiana, and Congressman Jim Greenwood of Pennsylvania.  I am extremely proud of the work we did last Congress. The enactment of Title I of the Children's Health Act (P.L 106-310) on October 17, which incorporated provisions of two bills Jim Greenwood and I introduced--HR 274 and HR 997--were a major feat for autism research.  Title I of this legislation, among other things, authorized the creation of 3 ``Centers of Excellence'' in autism epidemiology to conduct prevalence and incidence data on autism. In this way, scientists can get a better understanding of the scope of CDC and would specialize in a specific aspect of autism research. In addition, the centers would provide education on the best methods of diagnosis andtreatment of autism to educators and physicians.  In December, we worked hard to win appropriations of $3 million for Fiscal Year 2001 to fund the Centers of Excellence for CDC and begin larger-scale autism prevalence and incidence studies.  CDC expects to issue program announcements and requests for proposals in the early summer of 2001 to implement P.L. 106-310. Grants would be awarded to successfully completed applications to CDC for the ``Centers of Excellence'' sometime in the early fall of 2001.  Another provision in the Children's Health Act directs the Director of the NIH to establish not less than 5 Centers of Excellence to conduct basic and clinical research including developmental neurobiology, genetics and psychopharmacology.  The Members of C.A.R.E. will work to further advance the process of establishing these Centers of Excellence, which will lead to a better understanding of autism and related disorders.  The 106th Congress also significantly boosted total federal funding for autism. We want to take a page out of that playbook and repeat that success this year as well. CDC funding for autism increased from $1.1 million in FY 2000 to $6.7 million in FY 2001. Since FY 1998, when autism finding at CDC was a mere $287,000, funding has increased by a net total of 2,246 precent! That's 23.5 times what CDC spent just four years ago.  At NIH, Congress won increases in funding for autism from $40 million in FY 1999 to $45 million in 2000. Funding for 2001 is also expected to increase. Since FY 1998, autism research has been increased by 66 percent at NIH. Maybe this year we can make yet another installment on our plan to double autism research at NIH.  Finally, at the request of interested Members of Congress and with grass roots support, the House has held two separate hearings on the problem of autism--one by the Commerce Committee and another by the Government Reform and Oversight Committee. Additional hearings are likely if Member interest stays strong. I know Chairman Dan Burton at the Government Reform and Oversight Committee remains deeply interested in further hearings. And Chairman Mike Bilirakis is another strong supporter of autism research and oversight.                          ____________________
