I ask the Senator for her reaction on this. What if we said, instead of computers, we are going to deal with airplanes this way. If we said we do not want people who make airplanes to be held liable if they fall out of the sky, America would say that is crazy, that is ridiculous. We, of course, want to hold the manufacturers of products where we have a lot at stake to a standard of care.  If you were going to absolve them, insulate them, then, frankly, as a consumer I am going to have second thoughts about getting on the airplane.  I think what the Senator is saying with her amendment is those companies that have done the right thing,have established their reputation for integrity by stepping forward and saying we are solving the Y2K problem, certified, as the gentleman from Dell Computer did with the SEC, these companies that have gone that extra mile and want to stand behind that reputation will actually be penalized by this bill, because, frankly, all their hard work is not only being ignored, it is being defied.  They are saying: We have to carve out a special treatment here for those who didn't do a good job as businesspeople.  Coming back to the point I made earlier, the victims here are not trial lawyers. The victims are businesses, small businesses as well as medium-size businesses, trying to keep their employees at work, worrying that January 2 of the year 2000, they are going to have to close down and send people home without a paycheck. Those are the folks disadvantaged by the broad sweep of this bill.  I think the Senator from California is on the right track. The good actors, the ones that have worked hard to make this work, should be rewarded. Those that have not should not be protected by the National Association of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and all of the interests that have come in here and said, let us provide special treatment for those that have not met their responsibility.
