Speaker, earlier this year, I joined my Energy and Commerce Committee colleague Diana DeGette of Colorado in launching a bipartisan initiative called 21st Century Cures, which is taking the first-ever comprehensive look at the cures process here in the United States--from discovery to development to delivery. Our goal is to help bring lifesaving treatments, devices, and therapies to patients faster and ensure our nation's laboratories and manufacturers remain global leaders in medical innovation.  Our initiative has fostered a nationwide dialogue, bringing together the brightest minds in the field of public health. One of Michigan's health leaders has been a part of that conversation from the very beginning, taking part in our first Cures roundtable on May 6: Dr. James O. Woolliscroft, MD, dean of the University of Michigan Medical School.  I recently had the opportunity to speak with some of the nation's top health researchers about the cutting-edge work being done in their laboratories at the University of Michigan. The scientific discoveries being made there are truly incredible and will ultimately help save untold American lives. The work being done within the University of Michigan Health System and at the U-M Medical School in particular is in no small part thanks to the visionary leadership of Dr. Woolliscroft.  Dr. Woolliscroft was recently recognized by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) with its highest honor: the Abraham Flexner Award for Distinguished Service to Medical Education.  Dr. Woolliscroft has been a national leader in medical education for more than three decades, since joining the U-M medical faculty in 1980. He has served the school in several capacities until becoming dean in 2007, with a focus on transforming the curriculum to train our next generation of medical leaders.  In the words of one of his AAMC nominators, Dr. Woolliscroft ``has been consistently ahead of his time and often prophetic about the trends in medical education.'' He was among the first to advocate moving the paradigm of medical education from the acquisition of knowledge to performance-based metrics. Likewise, Dr. Woolliscroft was among the first to champion medical student training in community settings. Through his tireless efforts, these have become the new standards in medical education. And like all great teachers, Dr. Woolliscroft not only imparts knowledge, but inspires others through his passion for educating.  The discoveries being made in the life sciences astound and amaze, opening up opportunities for therapies, treatments, and care never before possible. Thanks to the leadership of individuals like Dr. Woolliscroft, the United States will continue to lead the world in providing the highest level of patient care and medical training.                          ____________________
