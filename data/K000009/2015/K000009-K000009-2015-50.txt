 Mr. Speaker, this week's scenario reminds me of the NAFTA fight. To pick up wavering Members back then, a deal was cut even to protect the corn broom industry, but in this deal, we don't protect people. In this deal, there is no protection against human trafficking. That has been stripped out. So we have protections for corn brooms but not for people.  In return for securing votes for narrow interests to gain a majority for passage, a few thousand people may benefit handsomely from these little provisions, but America won't. We will continue to rack up massive trade and job deficits as world markets remain closed to us, as they have for four decades. State-run enterprises will continue to eat more of our lunch. And for America's working class, millions more of whom will be left out in the cold, the TPP will be a truly pathetic package. I urge ``no,'' ``no,'' ``no'' votes this afternoon. Stand up for America's workers for a change.
