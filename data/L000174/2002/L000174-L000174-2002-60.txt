President, I rise to discuss the situation of the Roma people in Serbia and Montenegro, which together make up the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, FRY.  I am among those who believe that the United States should continue to strongly support the development of democratic institutions and reconciliation among ethnic groups throughout the FRY and Senator McConnell and I have tried to do that in the fiscal year 2003 Foreign Operations spending bill.  As in the past, we have provided funds to support democratic reformers in the FRY, as they continue to work to overcome the hatred and destruction caused by Slobodan Milosevic.  The United States is dedicated to ensuring that Serbia develops a solid commitment to peace, the rule of law, and to protecting the rights and well-being of its minority communities. That is why the funding level for Serbia--and indeed throughout the Balkans--recommended by the Committee on Appropriations is above what the President requested in his Fiscal Year 2003 budget.  Our law requires that the President certify to the Committee on Appropriations that the FRY is continuing to cooperate with the War Crimes Tribunal. He must also certify that the FRY is implementing policies which reflect a commitment to the rule of law, a commitment to end support for separate Republika Srpska institutions, and a commitment to ensure and protect the rights of minority groups.  Progress toward those goals has been made. But it has been slow, and the FRY has an inconsistent record of compliance with our law.  I recognize that the process of reform is difficult. Breaking down old hatreds can take generations. I have been very disappointed that even the reformers in positions of authority have not done more to support the Tribunal, and to expose the truth about Milosevic's crimes. However, even their inconsistent efforts are resisted at every turn by powerful nationalists who are far less committed to justice.  That political dynamic is the cause of much friction within the FRY, and is the cause of continuing difficulties between Serbia and the international community.  It is my hope, and I think I speak for everyone here, that the Balkans will eventually become a stable, peaceful, and tolerant region in which Serbia is the leading force for trade and democracy. Such a hope will become a reality only if our commitment to it remains strong.  As the world's attention has shifted toward Afghanistan and a possible war with Iraq, it is important that our concerns for the FRY are not drowned out by events elsewhere.  In addition to ensuring FRY compliance with the Tribunal, there is still serious work to be done on behalf of minority groups there.  In particular, a higher level of attention must be focused on the plight of the Roma people, whose history is one of discrimination and suffering.  The Roma are an ethnic group that traces their heritage back about one thousand years to the north of India. They first settled in Eastern Europe in the 14th Century. Today, Roma reside in all parts of Europe.  Over the centuries, the Roma have been the victims of murderous violence and debilitating discrimination that has poisoned their relations with their host nations, stunted their growth as a community, and perpetuated a vicious cycle of poverty, unemployment, sickness, and every form of social ostracism.  It is a cycle that has sentenced the Roma to shorter lives, lower literacy rates, and often horrid living conditions--living conditions that are far below those of the general populations of their host nations.  I read in a recent publication that in England, during the time of Elizabeth I, there was a law which made it illegal to be a Roma person, and under that law one could be put to death simply for being born to Roma parents. Also during that time, in Switzerland, it was legal to hunt Roma for sport.  During the Second World War, the Roma were among the first ethnic groups targeted for eradication by Hitler. Until the 1970s, in other parts ofEurope, policies have resulted in separating Romani children from their parents so they could be raised by non-Roma families.  The last decade has been no kinder to the Roma. During the Balkan wars of the 1990s, the Roma were severely victimized. And the abuse of the Roma continues now during peacetime.  The FRY has officially registered the Roma as a minority group, and has mandated that more Romani language programs appear on state television. These are important steps and are to be commended.  Much progress toward equitable and lawful treatment of the Roma, however, is yet to be made by the FRY, where the Roma are reportedly subject to frequent police brutality.  They often live in illegal settlements on the outskirts of towns, without electricity, running water, or sanitation.  International nongovernmental organizations willing to assist the Roma in constructing more permanent housing have been forced to cancel their projects, because the FRY and local authorities denied them the necessary land.  Roma in the FRY are also the targets of humiliating social discrimination. They are frequently denied access to privately owned restaurants and sports facilities. Roma do not receive adequate education, health care, or equitable access to public goods and services. In many FRY communities they are treated as a public nuisance.  Very little effort is made by state prosecutors to pursue cases of discrimination against Roma in the courts, partially due to widespread apathy for the Roma and partially because of weak legislation protecting the rights of minorities.  The Roma experience is one of suffering. Their's is a life of waiting, and one of hope lost as the tide of history threatens to sweep them aside.  As with its cooperation with the Hague Tribunal, the FRY's respect for the rights of the Roma must be closely monitored and verified. The President's certification to the Committee on Appropriations concerning funds appropriated for the FY should address both issues.  Continuing progress by the FRY in ensuring the safety and dignity of all its citizens, including the Roma, is the intent of our law and essential to the future stability of the former Yugoslavia.                          ____________________
