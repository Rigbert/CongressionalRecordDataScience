 President, I am concerned that the $2.50 user fee in this bill is not sufficient to provide all of the air marshals we need. The $2.50 user fee would only provide between $1.3 billion and $1.7 billion annually, in my opinion, enough to fund Federal security screeners at our airports, but not enough to provide additional air marshals.  Today, I intended to offer an amendment to give the Secretary of Transportation discretion to raise this fee to $5, which would raise over $3 billion annually to devote to aviation safety.  To ensure that the bill on the Floor passes quickly and we provide increased aviation security as soon as possible, I have decided not to proceed with my amendment. I still believe, however, that people are willing to pay more to feel safe on airplanes and the more air marshals we have, the better.  I want to thank the Members of the Commerce Committee for their hard work on this bill, and especially the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee, Senator Hollings and Senator McCain.  Mr. McCAIN. Thank you Senator Feinstein. I too am concerned about airline safety and want to be sure we have provided enough funding for marshals. The Senator from California has my full assurance that if more air marshals are needed, I will support providing more funding to the Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration to accomplish that goal.
