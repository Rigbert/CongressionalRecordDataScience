President, I wish to list the amendments that are included in the substitute that my distinguished colleague Senator Stabenow and I and our diligent staff have been working on. They are as follows: Senator Jones, No. 3081; Senator Smith, No. 3082; Senator Kennedy, No. 3097; Senator Murkowski, No. 3110; Senator Hatch, No. 3125; Senator Merkley, No. 3147; Senator Tester, No. 3148; Senator Gillibrand, No. 3154; Senator Gardner, No. 3157; Senator Moran, No. 3159; Senator Collins, No. 3160; Senator Peters, No. 3164; Senator Shaheen, No. 3172; Senator Feinstein, No. 3177; Senator Cornyn, No. 3186; Senator Cantwell and Senator Crapo, No. 3209; and Senator Gardner, again, No. 3218; and Senator Grassley.  I wish to note that this represents 18 amendments put in the substitute--extremely bipartisan. I have read ``Republican,'' ``Democrat,'' ``Democrat,'' ``Republican'' all through these 18 amendments. We have proceeded that way in committee. We are proceeding this way on the floor. I urge Members to bring their amendments to the floor for consideration, and, hopefully, the amendments will be of a nature that we can consider them without controversy. I know people have strong concerns about whatever amendment they submit.  Again, the ultimate goal is to do this quickly and to provide farmers certainty and predictability during this difficult time they are going through. I hope Members will keep that in mind with regard to any amendment they may be considering.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
