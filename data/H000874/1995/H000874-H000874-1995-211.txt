Speaker, after that I would like my friend from Maryland to yield.  Mr. McINTOSH. Mr. Speaker, if I could point out one thing that I think is undermining a lot of the public confidence of charitable groups, that is when they see activities like we are describing where groups who are supposed to be engaged in charity in fact turn themselves into political groups and engage in that type of activity.  That comes on the heels of a few years ago tremendous scandals with the United Way and groups where they were misappropriating funds. By the way, they have cleaned up their act. I certainly hope they end up supporting our effort to end welfare for lobbyists to reassure people that they have changed and do not want to see the continued practice where a charity says they are doing one thing and then in fact does something else with the money they have raised. In this case it is engaging in political tactics that are totally unacceptable because they are misleading the public about very key and critical issues.  So there is a question of confidence about what can citizens expect from charitable groups. We heard from a lot of the charities who are very active in a day-to-day basis in helping people, saying they want to see this bill passed because they want to restore that confidence. They want us to go forward in this area and clearly separate lobbying and political activities from charitable activities.  So I think we can do them a tremendous favor in this country by helping to restore that confidence.  I also appreciate the gentleman from Washington being willing to share with us his experience in his State as an example of what has been happening there.
