 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a very special part of my home State, the Commonwealth of Kentucky. I am speaking of McCreary County, in the southeastern region of the State. This year, McCreary County celebrates its centennial; according to the McCreary County Museum located in the heart of historic downtown Stearns, KY, the county's birthday was on March 12, 2012. One hundred years ago, Kentucky Governor James B. McCreary signed the legislation creating the county, named after himself, as the 120th and last county of the Bluegrass State, formed out of portions of Wayne, Pulaski and Whitley counties.  The people of McCreary County today have upheld the rich traditions and legacy of the hardy Kentuckians who were there for that county's founding 100 years ago. They have exemplified the very best of what southeastern Kentucky has to offer, they have kept Kentucky's history alive, and they represent the future of Kentucky and our Nation. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in wishing the people of McCreary County the very best as they celebrate their centennial.  An article published in the McCreary County Record recently described the events of McCreary County's centennial celebration. I ask unanimous consent that said article appear in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to appear as follows:            [From the McCreary County Record, Mar. 15, 2012]    Happy Birthday! County Marks 100 Years With Day-Long Celebration                           (By Janie Slaven)       Whitley City.--The past, present, and future converged      Monday as McCreary County celebrated its centennial.       Festivities centered around the local courthouse, which      attracted state and federal dignitaries.       Representatives for Governor Steve Beshear and U.S. Senator      Mitch McConnell read congratulatory letters while State      Representative Sara Beth Gregory presented McCreary County      Judge-Executive Doug Stephens with a resolution passed by the      House on Friday.       Judge Stephens opened the ceremony with a prayer. Quoting I      Chronicles, he acknowledged that McCreary County has suffered      the ``curse of poverty and scourge of drugs'' but asked God      to heal our land. The judge went on to praise the endurance      and resilience of our citizens, saying that McCreary County      is not just a spot on a map but a way of life.       ``We have a rich history but we also have a rich future,''      Judge Stephens said.       To illustrate that history, the bulk of the ceremony was      devoted to ``A Governor's Visit''--the dramatization of      namesake Governor James B. McCreary's 1914 visit to      Kentucky's latest county--by local historian Sam Perry.      Through speeches from the governor (as portrayed by Jimmy      Waters), first elected county judge Joseph Williams (Adam      Phillips), State Rep. William B. Creekmore (Grady Wilson),      and narration from former judge-executive Jimmie W. Greene;      the play gave the crowd attending a lesson in who settled the      Big South Fork region and what went into forging the new      McCreary County from portions of Wayne, Pulaski and Whitley      counties.       Following the play, Judge Stephens ceremoniously cut the      first piece of the county birthday cake (prepared by Yummi      Bakery)--which he presented to the oldest citizen in      attendance, Fannie Morgan, who turned 100 last November. The      second piece went to the youngest citizen, four-year-old      Bailey Gilreath.       The crowd then gathered into the fiscal courtroom, where      county officials debuted the recently refurbished portraits      of 14 of McCreary County's 19 judges and judge-executives.      Centennial Commission member Shane Gilreath noted that the      elite group came from all walks of life. They were attorneys,      social workers, farmers, miners, teachers and more.       Photographs of Mahan Renfro and Joseph Williams, which had      hung in the portrait gallery and have been replaced by      paintings, were presented to family members. Maxine Lawson,      ``Cookie'' Joe Williams and Debbie Jo Peterson represented      three generations of the Williams family. Greene, Renfro's      nephew by marriage, joked that he had lobbied for a portrait      to represent each of his four terms.       Deputy Judge-Executive Andrew Powell and McCreary County      Museum director Amy Combs recognized the artists in      attendance--including Dorothy Washam, Dale Crabtree, and      Nadine Heth--before unveiling two new portraits honoring the      last two judge-executives. Judge Stephens's portrait will be      hung at a later date, but Blaine Phillips's portrait was hung      by his wife, Kathy, and twin brother, Wayne.       Before breaking for a luncheon hosted by the McCreary      County Historical Society, those attending had the      opportunity to view a number of exhibits displayed throughout      the courthouse's ground floor.       If the morning was devoted to our county's past, the      evening focused firmly on the future. After signing a      proclamation honoring the county's centennial during Monday's      regular fiscal court meeting, Judge Stephens signed another      in honor of the Girl Scouts' 100th anniversary. Local      troops--assisted by representatives from the Daniel Boone      National Forest's Stearns Ranger District (which is      celebrating its 75th anniversary)--planted a sugar maple on      the courthouse lawn.       If you missed Monday's celebration, you have several      opportunities to obtain centennial keepsakes.
