President, let me first say I thought the statement from the distinguished Senator from Georgia was spot on, and I particularly appreciated his point that when we confirm Leon Panetta to head Defense, no one can possibly predict what kind of challenges he will face there. But this is the kind of person who, because of ability and background, is up to any kindof challenges that are thrown to him. So I want to associate myself with my colleague from Georgia.  Mr. President, I would suggest the absence of a quorum.
