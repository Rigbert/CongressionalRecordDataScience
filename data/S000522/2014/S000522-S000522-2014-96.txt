I thank my good friend and colleague for his leadership, for standing so strong, and for reminding everyone about the importance of the crisis pregnancy centers, which are a lifeline to so many women who might otherwise abort and make that irreversible decision. So thank you for underscoring that.  I would like to yield to my good friend and colleague from Nebraska, who has also been a tremendous leader in the cause of life and human rights in general.
