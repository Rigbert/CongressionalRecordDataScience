Speaker, I rise today to wholeheartedly endorse the Financial Freedom Act of 1999, legislation sponsored by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Archer) to provide broad-based tax relief to help individuals and families make ends meet. This is common sense legislation that will not only bring tax relief to all Americans but also prevent special interests in Washington from spending the budget surplus on a myriad of unnecessary new government programs.  I particularly support the inclusion of death tax relief. The death tax has robbed millions of Americans, especially our Nation's farmers, of their hard-earned money and their ability to leave a legacy to their children and grandchildren. The death tax unfairly punishes those who have worked hard their entire lives to achieve the American Dream and provide a safe and secure environment for their families.  Death tax relief also will allow family businesses and farms to remain in the family, ensuring that both the business and the jobs it provides continue to live on for the next generation.  The bill of the gentleman from Texas also incrementally decreases the tax burden, eliminating it over the next 10 years. This balanced and fair approach will provide immediate relief in the short term, while not making unreasonable demands on our budget surplus.  Americans currently pay the highest taxes since World War II, and for the first time in a generation, we have the financial strength to safely return a portion of our surplus to hard-working Americans. This is solid legislation, and I urge all my colleagues to support it.                          ____________________
