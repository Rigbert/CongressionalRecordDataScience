President, I am soon going to ask for a vote on the Leahy-Grassley-Kyl managers' amendment. It resolves a number of issues in the bill, including fee diversion and business method patents damages, venue issues. Senators Coburn, Schumer, Bennet, Whitehouse, Coons, and others worked with us on those issues. I would like to vote on that and then go to the amendment offered yesterday by Senator Bennet on satellite patent offices, with a modification, as well as the modified amendment offered by Senator Kirk and Senator Pryor on ombudsman. If we can do that, we can get much of this finished. But while I am waiting for the--just so everybody will know, I am going to ask for a vote on that very soon. But I am waiting for the ranking member to come back.  I see the distinguished senior Senator from Minnesota, and I yield to her.
