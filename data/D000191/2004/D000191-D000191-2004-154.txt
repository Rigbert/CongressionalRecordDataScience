Speaker, I rise today to recognize and to congratulate Martha ``Marti'' Young of Roseburg, Oregon. The Oregon Commission for Women selected Ms. Young as one of the 2004 Women of Achievement. She will be honored on Saturday, October 2nd, at the 20th Annual Women of Achievement Awards Dinner for her determined advocacy, intelligent leadership, and inspired vision on behalf of low income Oregonians.  Marti Young has an impressive record of public service, with over thirty years of active participation. Wherever there has been innovation, progress, and development in human services in Oregon, she has been in the front ranks. She has been an unstoppable advocate, mobilizing resources and providing services to alleviate poverty and enhance the quality of life for the poor, the elderly, and people with disabilities.  Marti Young gets things done--and done well. She has worked with the low income community and community partners to establish Head Start programs, a child care center for low income families, a school lunch program, and an emergency food bank, an energy assistance program, transportation services, shelter programs, and other resources and opportunities vital to the health and well-being of Douglas County.  The world is full of heroes like Marti Young, working every day to make the world a better place. I am pleased to offer her the heartfelt congratulations and warm thanks she so richly merits.                          ____________________
