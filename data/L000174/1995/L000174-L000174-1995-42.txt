President, I understand this afternoon at some point, we will have a vote on whether to proceed to the conference report on Department of Defense authorization. I am strongly opposed to several provisions in that bill. I will not ask the clerks to read the bill in full when it comes up, as I could. It is my way of saying ``Merry Christmas'' to them, I suppose, and to the rest of the staff. But I will express very strong concerns about it and, of course, will ask for a recorded vote on the issue of proceeding.  I do not want to hold up the issue, though, of course and as soon as it comes over here--I see the distinguished chairman, my good friend from South Carolina on the floor--I would not want to hold him up.
