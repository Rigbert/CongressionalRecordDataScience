Chair, I certainly wasn't referring to my colleague, who I know is here in good faith on his own terms.  The point is, on June 29, 2017, the DOT stated that TIFIA loans will not be considered Federal funds for the purposes of evaluating how much local share an applicant brings to the table.  What changed in that year? All years prior, that was allowed. In 2017, suddenly, they changed their mind.  That is what I am talking about, rotten politics.
