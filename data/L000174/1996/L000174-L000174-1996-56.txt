President, the Kellogg-Hubbard Library in Montpelier recently celebrated its 100th anniversary. The Kellogg-Hubbard Library holds a very special place in my heart, because I had my first library card there. I used to go almost every day. I would be reading a book at school or a book at home and sometimes a book in the library in the evening.  Mrs. Jean Holbrook, who was the librarian, was one of those people who truly helped form my life and my educational accomplishments as a child. It was she who told me when I got bored with the curriculum in the third grade that I could also be spending my time reading Dickens and Robert Louis Stevenson, and I did with great enjoyment. It was she who told me that when I read just about everything in the children's library, that she would go with me to get a card in the upstairs library, the grownups' library. I guess I was probably the youngest grownup at the time, but this helped me, and it has helped me immeasurably throughout my life.  Even today, when I give graduation addresses in high schools and even sometimes grade schools in Vermont, I tell the graduates they have already learned the most important thing in their life--they have learned to read. On top of learning to read, they have developed a love for reading, and every door in life will be open to them because their love of reading will allow them to expand their imagination and their love of life in a way they could not otherwise, but also help them learn to be whatever they want to be.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article I wrote for the Times Argus in Vermont about the Hubbard Library titled ``Montpelier Boy Realizes Miss Holbrook Was Right'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Times Argus, June 13, 1996]            Montpelier Boy Realizes Miss Holbrook Was Right                           (By Patrick Leahy)       The 100th anniversary of the Kellogg-Hubbard Library      triggers memories for all of us who have lived in Montpelier.      And they are great memories.       While I was growing up, Montpelier did not have television.      We children did not have the advantage of cable TV with 10      channels giving us the opportunity to buy things we didn't      need and would never use or another 10 offering blessings or      redemptions for an adequate contribution.       Depirved as we were, we made do with the Lone Ranger and      Inner Sanctum on the radio and Saturday's serials at the      Strand Theater on Main Street. For a few minutes on Saturday      afternoon, we could watch Hopalong Cassidy, Tarzan, Flash      Gordon, Jungle Jim or Batman face death-defying predicaments      that would guarantee you would be back the next Saturday, 14      cents in hand, to see how they survived (and I recall they      always did).       Having exhausted radio, Saturday matinees, the latest comic      books (I had a favorite) and childhood games and chores, we      were left to our own imagination.       That was the best part.       We were a generation who let the genies of our imagination      out of the bottle be reading. Then, as now, reading was one      of my great pleasures.       My parents had owned the Waterbury Record Weekly newspaper      and then started the Leahy Press in Montpelier, which they      ran until selling it at their retirement. The Leahy family      was at home with the printed word and I learned to read early      in life.       At 5 years old I went down the stairs on the Kellog-Hubbard      Children's Library, and the years that followed provided some      of the most important experiences of my life.       In the '40s and '50s, the Kellogg-Hubbard was blessed with      a whitehaired children's librarian named Miss Holbrook. Her      vocation in life had to be to help children read and to make      reading enjoyable. She succeeded more than even she might      have dreamed.       She had the key to unlocking our imagination.       With my parents' encouragement, the Kellogg-Hubbard was a      regular stop every afternoon as I left school. On any day I      had two or three books checked out. My sister Mary, brother      John and I read constantly.       In my years as U.S. senator, it seems I never traveled so      far or experienced so much as I did as a child in Montpelier      with daily visits to the library. With Miss Holbrook's      encouragement I had read most of Dickens and Robert Louis      Stevenson in the early part of grade school.       To this day, I remember sitting in our home at 136 State      St. reading Treasure Island on a Saturday afternoon filled      with summer storms. I knew I heard the tap, tap, tap of the      blind man's stick coming down State Street and I remember the      great relief of seeing my mother and father returning from      visiting my grandparents in South Ryegate.       Miss Holbrook was right. A good book and an active      imagination creates its own reality.       In my profession, I read computer messages, briefing      papers, constituent letters, legislation and briefings, the      Congressional Record--and an occasional book for pleasure--in      all, the equivalent of a full-length book each day.       Interesting as all this is, and owing much of my life to      those earlier experiences at the library, the truest reading      pleasure was then. I worry that so many children today miss      what our libraries offer.       During the past few years I have had many of my photographs      published. DC Comics and Warner Brothers have also asked me      to write for Batman or do voice-overs on their TV series. In      each case, I have asked them to send my payment to the      Kellogg-Hubbard Library to buy books for the Children's      Library.       It is my way of saying: ``Thank you, Miss Holbrook.''
