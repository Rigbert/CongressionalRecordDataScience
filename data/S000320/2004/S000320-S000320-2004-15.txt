 President, I am pleased that we will soon be voting on the nomination of Virginia Hopkins for the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. This nomination has been on the calendar for a number of months now and I am pleased that we are finally going to have an up or down vote.  Virginia Hopkins is a highly qualified candidate. She will be an important addition to the Federal bench. Like others who know Virginia, I have a high regard for her intellect and her integrity. She is a woman of the law who understands and respects the constitutional role of the judiciary and, specifically, the role of the federal courts in our legal system.  Having been a practicing attorney for more than a quarter century, Virginia has concentrated her legal practice in wills and estate planning, as well as intellectual property law and civil litigation. Virginia has a strong record of trying cases in both the federal and state courts for a broad range of individual and corporate clients. Without question, I believe it is fair to say that Virginia Hopkins is an experienced and skilled attorney.  In addition to being a devoted wife and mother of two children and a skilled attorney, Virginia is also active in her community. She has served on the board of the United Way of East Central Alabama, while also remaining active in her church. She is a graduate of the University of Alabama and also Virginia Law School.  Again, I am pleased to support the nomination of Ms. Virginia Hopkins to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. I am confident that she will serve honorably and that she will apply the law with impartiality and fairness. I encourage my colleagues to join with me in supporting her nomination as I believe that she will serve our nation with the honor and dignity required of the federal judiciary.  I yield the floor.
