Ruth passed away unexpectedly in December and her passing was noted by the well known and the unknown. Today those she served with and among gather to honor her efforts, pay special tribute, and remember a very fine lady.  Ruth Arden was the executive director of St. Paul's Community Center for many years. St. Paul's serves people who are homeless and mentally ill, and under Ruth's extraordinary vision and leadership the shelter served hundreds of people with respect. She and her team gave people dignity and the tools to navigate a difficult life. Ruth was an advocate for people who are homeless and mentally ill, and challenged leaders at the local, State and National levels to see their need. Jesus Christ reminded all that ``whatever you do to the least among you, that you do unto me.'' Few people follow His words as did Ruth, and her work inspired all around her.  Ruth Arden was an ardent advocate for the poor and downtrodden, but she was also an advocate of the arts. She enjoyed music--especially jazz--and supported local artists. Her support, advice and wise counsel were most appreciated, and in her quiet way Ruth moved mountains. Her life leaves an imprimatur on our community which stands well past her leave-taking, and her voice still echoes among those with whom she worked. She had an unforgettable spirit of caring and drive that we are guided by her spirit to carry forth.                          ____________________
