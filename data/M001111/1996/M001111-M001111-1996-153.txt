 President, it is with great sadness that I rise today to record the passing of a truly great American, Admiral James S. Russell. Adm. Russell built a remarkable legacy as a distinguished and decorated military officer and a respected civic leader in Washington State.  James Sargent Russell was born on March 22, 1903, in Tacoma, WA, where he spent his childhood. Eager to serve his country in World War I, he attempted to join the U.S. Navy after graduating from high school. Because he was too young, the Navy would not accept his enlistment. Instead, he followed his love of the sea, beginning his maritime career as a seaman in the Merchant Marine.  In 1922, he entered the U.S. Naval Academy, from which he graduated in 1926. This marked the beginning of a long and illustrious tour of duty with the U.S. Navy. After serving aboard the battleship West Virginia, he entered the young field of naval aviation, and was designated a Naval Aviator in 1929.  During World War II, then-Lieutenant Commander Russell led Patrol Squadron 42 in the Aleutian Island Campaign. For his heroism and exceptional service, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal, and the Legion of Merit. After serving in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations in Washington, DC, he returned to combat duty in the Pacific and was awarded a Gold Star in lieu of a second Legion of Merit.  Following World War II, he assumed the post of commander of the U.S.S. Coral Sea and then was chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, rising to the rank of vice admiral. From 1958 to 1962, he served as Vice Chief of Naval Operations with the four-star rank of Admiral. Because of his exceptionally meritorious efforts in that capacity, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.  In 1962, Admiral Russell was named commander in chief of the Allied Forces in Southern Europe, a position he held until his retirement from active duty in 1965. His leadership during a time of heightened tensions earned him a Gold Star in lieu of the second Distinguished Service Medal.  The advancement of the field of naval aviation owes a great deal to the work of Admiral Russell. He entered the field when biplanes ruled the skies and aided the development of supersonic fighters. For his work on the development of the F-8 Crusader Navy fighter, the first ship-based fighter to fly faster than 1,000 miles per hour, Admiral Russell was awarded the prestigious Collier Trophy in 1956.  Recognition of his work extends beyond the borders of the United States, and is evidenced by his receipt of three foreign decorations. These include: the Order of Naval Merit (Grand Officer) by Brazil, the Legion of Honor (Commander) by France, and the Peruvian Cross of Naval Merit (Great Cross).  After retiring from active duty, Admiral Russell returned to the Tacoma area and became a prominent member of that community. He remained active in the aerospace industry as a consultant and board member. However, his second career, which spanned almost as many years as his first, was as a civic leader who bridged the civilian and military communities. Indeed, at an age when many of his contemporaries were enjoying a quiet retirement, Admiral Russell took an active role in community affairs.  Admiral Russell leaves his wife, Geraldine; his son and daughter-in-law, Don and Katherine Russell; his daughter-in-law, Anitha Russell; five grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. I wish to express my sincere sympathy and condolences to these and other members of his family.  All who are acquainted with Admiral Russell know that his work has benefited and will continue to benefit countless individuals in Washington State, across this Nation, and around the globe. Admiral Russell served his country and community selflessly for three-quarters of a century. He led by example and earned the respect of all who knew him. I and so many people --his friends, colleagues, family, and community members--are sincerely grateful for his many contributions to military and civilian life. He leaves behind a great legacy and will not be soon forgotten.             TRIBUTE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY WILDCATS Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as my colleagues well know, I do not frequently venture down to the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue. The current occupant of the White House and I do not always see eye to eye. But, times change and I am anxiously awaiting the opportunity to set aside political differences in order to join the President in welcoming to Washington the 1996 NCAA Division I National Champions, the University of Kentucky Wildcats.  Mr. President, University of Kentucky basketball enjoys a proud history, one unequaled by any other school. In fact, in this season of unparalleled achievements, Kentucky not only earned bragging rights for the year, but they also became the winningest program in college basketball history. With their victory in the Mideast Regional Final, the Wildcats overtook the University of North Carolina and returned to their perch atop basketball's elite.  This fact is further demonstrated by the yearend Sagarin basketball Ratings. These figures compiled by basketball expert Jeff Sagarin factor in numerous variables, including schedule strength, to determine the top teams in Division I NCAA. This year, Kentucky posted a yearend rating of 103.26, which put the Wildcats not only in first place for the year, but also made it the top rated team in the 22-year history of these figures.  As for history, let's review a few quick facts about this Wildcat team. On their way to a 34-to-2 record, the Cats defeated every team on their schedule at least once by a minimum of 7 points. They scored 86 points in one-half against the LSU Tigers. Mr. President, for those of my colleagues who may not follow college basketball closely, allow me to put this achievement in terms more readily understandable. Scoring 86 points in one half is equivalent to Bob Dole winning the Presidency before the polls in the Midwest even close, which, by the way, I anticipate he will do. Finally, the Wildcats did something that nobody believed was possible in this age of parity in college athletics: they played the entire Southeastern Conference regular season without losing a single game. A perfect 16 and 0.  Rupp, Issel, Groza, Givens, Macy, Mashburn, Hall, and now Pitino. The Fabulous Five, Rupp's Runts, the Fiddlin' Five, Pitino's Bombinos, the Unforgettables, and now the Untouchables. UK basketball enjoys a tradition unequaled by any other program. Mr. President, I believe this tradition will continue to grow for decades to come.  I urge my colleagues to join me in extending congratulations to this team of outstanding young men, a group distinguished not only by their athletic achievements but their character as well. As an unabashed college basketball fanatic, I want to personally thank Coach Pitino, Athletic Director C.M. Newton, and President Charles Wethington for restoring dignity, excitement, and honor to this proud program. Their leadership provides an example all of us in public life would do well to emulate.                          ____________________
