President, before they leave, I commend my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, and my colleague from Vermont, Senator Jeffords, for the tremendous work they are doing on behalf of that critically important population of kids.  As the Senator from Connecticut noted, my home State would receive substantial sums under their important amendment. I support it and urge all my colleagues in the Senate to support the amendment.                          Iraq Reconstruction
