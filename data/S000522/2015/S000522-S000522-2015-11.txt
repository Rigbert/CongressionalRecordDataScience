I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Again, I want to thank Mr. Engel for his leadership and his kind words. Again, this is truly a collaborative effort, and I want to thank him for it.  Mr. Speaker, at a congressional hearing I chaired in 2002--and I chaired about 18 such hearings on combating anti-Semitism--Dr. Shimon Samuels of the Wiesenthal Center said: ``The Holocaust for 30 years after the war acted as a protective Teflon against blatant anti-Semitic expression, especially in Europe. That Teflon has eroded, and what was considered distasteful and politically incorrect is becoming simply an opinion.'' He warned ominously, saying, ``cocktail chatter at fine English dinners can end as Molotov cocktails against synagogues.''  Mr. Speaker, Abraham Lincoln once said that ``to sin by silence when they should protest makes cowards of men.'' Silence is not an option. And, I would equally say, nor is inaction.  If our fight is to succeed, we need government officials at all levels to not just denounce but to act without hesitation or delay whenever and wherever anti-Semitic acts occur. There are no exceptions. The purveyors of hate never take a holiday or grow weary, nor should we.  H. Res. 354 is a best practices resolution designed to seriously inspire and challenge the governments of Europe, especially law enforcement and their homeland security agencies, to partner with their respective Jewish communities to mitigate and hopefully end and eradicate anti-Semitism in all of its ugly manifestations.                              {time}  1945  United States law enforcement, Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department, the FBI, as well as State Homeland Security agencies, including in my own State of New Jersey, have been robust and aggressive in combating anti-Semitism here. We need to replicate this and encourage others to follow our lead and that of the UK, and I do hope we will do that.  This resolution is broadly bipartisan. I want to thank Nathaniel Hurd, on our staff, for his tremendous work on this resolution, working with all of his respective staffers and Members, of course, to bring this about. And I want to thank the leadership for bringing it to the floor this evening.  I urge a ``yea'' vote.  I yield back the balance of my time.
