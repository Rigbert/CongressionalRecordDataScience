For 128 days, we have failed to fulfill our basic responsibility of funding the government. Congress has not reached a bipartisan budget deal, even though, in past years, we always would have by this time. So the government is on autopilot.  Across America, just as I find in Vermont, around families' kitchen tables, people are asking how to address the opioid crisis. Veterans are asking us why it takes months to get a doctor's appointment at the VA. People are worrying about having to stop working if they can't get quality and affordable childcare. So many have stopped me in the street to talk about how they are struggling to pay off college loans.  Well, it has been 128 days. Instead of saying: We will get to it, the check is in the mail, let's actually get to it, we have had four continuing resolutions. It is about time we get serious about a bipartisan deal and get the budget going. Let's, for once, get past thesound bites and start dealing with substance.                          ____________________
