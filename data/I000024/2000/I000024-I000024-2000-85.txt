President, I rise today to recognize the outstanding performance of several students from Enid High School in Enid, Oklahoma. The following students participated in the We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution national finals competition in Washington DC. The students who participated in the competition are: Aaron Bonnett, Beau Brumfield, Cheyenne Combs, Keneisha Green, Heather Hansen, Tim Healy, Erin Hickey, Kenneth Ingle, M. Brandon Jones, Heather Kline, Thomas Lentz, Becky Lewis, Meredith Meara, Yvonne Midkiff, Katie Oden, Derek Podolny, Brandi Pride, Diana Rogers, Ryan Seals, Jamie Thibodeau, Carl Tompson, along with their teacher Cheryl Franklin.  The national finals competition brings together 50 classes from throughout the United States and provides the students the opportunity to testify as constitutional experts before a panel of judges. The students from Enid displayed remarkable understanding of the ideals and values of the American Constitution and are to be commended for their efforts. Again, congratulations to these outstanding Oklahoma students and their teacher.                          ____________________
