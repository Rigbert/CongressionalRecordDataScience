Mr. Chairman, well, I am just concerned about that because this company called Idle Air, it has done an outstanding job, and they are trying to do the job right without any government money or support. And they are doing exactly what my colleague wants to do, but the truck does have to go and they have their waiting time that they have to rest, refuel their trucks, et cetera.  And it seems to me if we add this extra 400 pounds for additional equipment, it would be detrimental to that individual company. That concerns me somewhat. I am sort of taking sides on that issue is what I am saying. With your proposal, would that hurt the company?
