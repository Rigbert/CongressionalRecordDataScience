Speaker, it is my distinct honor to commend seven dedicated teachers from Northwest Indiana who have been voted outstanding educators by their peers for the 1998-1999 school year. These individuals, Bea Cak, Debra Clements, Jayne Gardner, Kevin Garling, Brenda Kovich, Toni Sulewski, and Denise Thrasher will be presented the Crystal Apple Award at a reception sponsored by the Indiana State Teachers Association and Horace Mann Insurance Company. This glorious event will take place at theBroadmoor County Club in Merrillville, Indiana, on Tuesday, May 4, 1999. Toni Sulewski will also receive the Torch of Knowledge Award for being selected the outstanding member of this distinguished group of educators.  Bea Cak from Hanover Community School Corporation has taught for 27 years. Currently she teaches second grade half of the day, and serves as the district elementary resource teacher at Jane Ball Elementary the other half of her workday. As a resource teacher, Bea has the responsibility of providing information and techniques to keep staff personnel updated. During monthly staff in-service sessions she shares creative K-6 activities that all teachers can utilize in their classrooms. Her colleagues know her as a dedicated teacher since she puts so much time into developing special projects for the school and her surrounding community.  Debra Clements is described by her peers as an outstanding professional and dedicated teacher. She is an English/language arts teacher at Highland High School where she has taught for 19 years. To grow professionally, Debra has been actively involved in textbook selections and handbook revisions. She strives to be approachable and communicates well with administrators, fellow teachers, students and parents. Her special inner core of education-related beliefs and opinions are well received and respected.  Within her 25 years of teaching, Jayne Gardner had the opportunity to teach in many diverse settings. Currently, she serves as an English/language arts teacher at Kahler Middle School. She utilizes her ability as a mediator to discuss and address the concerns of teachers. Through her caring attitude she exhibits a great deal of thoughtfulness towards both students and teachers. Jayne's dedication to the profession of teaching is exemplary to any new educator.  For the past 13 years, Kevin Garling has been the agriculture teacher at Lowell High School. His teaching approach is built upon the theme ``Kids come first.'' As a sponsor of the Future Farmers of America, he has taken the club members to state and national competitions. He has created a parental group to work with the club members. Kevin's unselfishness and commitment to his students are an inspiration to all who know him.  Brenda Kovich, a national board certified teacher, has worked with academically talented students at Elliott Elementary School in Munster, Indiana, for the past 15 years. She has written and received numerous grants, including a grant from the Lilly Foundation. Brenda is a continuous source of enthusiasm for both her students and others.  Toni Sulewski from the Crown Point Community School Corporation has taught for 30 years. Dedicated to those students who have difficulty with school, she persevered to ensure an alternative school program was developed in the community. As a professional educator, she works closely with the special education staff to adapt teaching methods to the various students' learning styles. Her performance as a professional is twofold: one is her dedication to the students and their development; while the second is her dedication to fellow teachers and the safety of their environment.  Denise Thrasher teaches foreign language and literature at North Newton High School. Her commitment to students is obvious. She tutors students during lunchtime and also after school. Despite having cancer surgery and undergoing chemotherapy treatments, she has remained very active both teaching and serving on local and state school committees. Denise's energy is an incentive to all.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my distinguished colleagues to join me in commending these outstanding educators on their receipt of the 1999 Crystal Apple Award. The years of hard work they have put forth in shaping the minds and futures of Northwest Indiana's young people is a true inspiration to us all.                          ____________________
