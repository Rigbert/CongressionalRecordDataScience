Speaker, I include in the Record a biography and list of accomplishments of August ``Gus'' Schumacher. Additionally, I include a copy of the Washington Post obituary article of Mr. Schumacher.  August ``Gus'' Schumacher--Biography and Accomplishments: (Dec. 4,                           1939-Sept. 24, 2017)                              biographical       August Schumacher Jr. was born in Lincoln, Mass., on Dec.      4, 1939.       --Fourth-generation farmer.       --His father was one of the largest parsnip growers in      Massachusetts.       --Gus grew up on a farm in Lexington, Massachusetts.       --His grandfather and great-grandfather were farmers in New      York City.       --They grew winter vegetables in glass-enclosed hothouses.       Schumacher graduated from Harvard University in 1961 and      attended the London School of Economics.           according to joel berg, ceo of hunger free america       ``I had the high honor of working with, and learning from,      Gus at USDA during the Clinton Administration. He was a giant      who always pushed the envelope to get better programs and      more social justice, across America and the globe. He was a      driving force in creating the first federal program to enable      seniors to obtain extra produce at farmers' markets. He was      also the spark for the Dole-McGovern program, through which      the U.S. enabled developing countries to start school meals      program. When the stakes were high for people in need, Gus      didn't take `no'--even repeatedly--for an answer. He kept      pushing for new ways to get bureaucracies to aid people in      need. Perhaps his most important legacy was pioneering ways      to reduce hunger and aid community food systems and, at the      same time, transcending the stale debate over whether we      should focus on just one of those goals. After leaving      government service, he could have taken a well-earned      retirement. Instead he upped his work to make fresh, healthy      food affordable and available for everyone. As a person, he      will be deeply missed. But his legacy has improved the world      forever.''                               world bank       Took a job in the mid-1960s as a food project manager and      agriculture development officer for the World Bank.       He spent the next two decades concentrating on technical      appraisals for agricultural-related loans in countries      including China, Egypt, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.       Developed livestock operations in western Brazil, lent      assistance to herders in Kenya and projects in the Kosovo      Province of what was then Yugoslavia.       After more than five years as agriculture commissioner, he      returned to the World Bank to help restructure the farm      sector in Central Europe after the breakup of the Soviet      Union.         commissioner of food and agriculture for massachusetts       Between 1984 and 1990 when Mr. Schumacher was agriculture      chief for Massachusetts, he created market coupon programs      for seniors and low-income families with children.       Also served as the Massachusetts commissioner of food and      agriculture; he was appointed agriculture commissioner in      Massachusetts by Governor Michael Dukakis.       In 1992, Sen. John Kerry and Rep. Chet Atkins, of      Massachusetts, authorized the WIC Farmers Market Nutrition      Program into the federal budget, and today it is a almost a      $6 billion program that allows every WIC mother and child to      get vouchers for fresh produce at farmers markets and      supermarkets.       Gus raised $17,000 from the state and the Chiles Foundation      to create a Massachusetts pilot program that gave $10 worth      of produce coupons to WIC recipients to use at area farmers      markets.                   usda undersecretary of agriculture       USDA undersecretary of agriculture for farm and foreign      agricultural services from 1997 to 2001.       Gus found that the commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act      of 1935's (CCC) stated purpose was the ``promotion and      marketing of American agricultural products,'' not just large      commodity crops. Gus told the USDA lawyers that he wanted to      create a market nutrition program for seniors using the      authority of the CCC. ``They looked at me like I just jumped      off the fifth floor,'' he recalled. ``They said, no, that's      not normal. I said, guys, it doesn't say wheat, corn, and      cotton. `Just write me a memo so I don't get indicted' ''.       In 2000, the program began with $10 million in funding, and      is now funded at $22 million annually.       In 1997 he became U.S. Undersecretary for Farm, Foreign,      and Agricultural Services in the Clinton Administration, and      he wanted to try to install a program for low-income seniors      at the federal level like the WIC Market Nutrition Program.       On his watch the state Agriculture Department launched      ``The Fresh Connection,'' a newsletter and free service that      listed the sources and seasonal availability of foods.                       senior advisor--world bank       Schumacher directed World Bank teams involved in major      agricultural and forest sector re-structuring of post-     Communist Poland. Project funding of $450 million was      disbursed under Poland Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan      ($300 million) and Forest Development Project ($150 million).      He also led teams that developed the first Global Environment      Fund (GEF). Which also produced four other successful GEF      biodiversity protection projects in Slovakia, Czech Republic,      Belarus and Ukraine.                          wholesome wave (ww)       Since 2008 he had served as founding board chairman of      Wholesome Wave in Bridgeport, Conn., which seeks to increase      access to affordable, locally grown fruits and vegetables.       In 2012, Wholesome Wave funding jumped to $2.38 million for      306 markets and 54 partners in 24 states and D.C.--money WW      uses to match the SNAP benefits that farmers markets would      receive were they able to register themselves for EBT card      use. Unlike now-defunct paper vouchers, EBT cards cannot be      used at many farmers markets; most lack the equipment to      process EBT purchases. Due to this, by 2004, SNAP spending at      farmers markets had plummeted to $2 million annually, from      $82 million in 1990. In order to accept electronic benefits,      a retailer--whether it was a grocery store or a farmers      market--needed authorization from the USDA's Food and      Nutrition Service (FNS), which authorization is hard for      small businesses like farmers markets to receive. However,      this authorization is recognized for its success in      preventing EBT voucher fraud. WW circumvents this bureaucracy      by using the aforementioned funds to create a match program      for farmers markets similar to that used by the government      through the SNAP program.                               semi-official       In California, non-profit Roots of Change, with grant      writing assistance from Gus for $1,500,000 for marketing      support of incentives, launched a program called Market      Match. The simultaneous appearance--and success--of double-     your money markets drew national media and grant-makers'      attention and laid the foundation for rapid expansion. By      2009, Wholesome Wave granted $330,000, up from just $38,000      the year before, to shoppers at 40 farmers markets in 10      states plus the District of Columbia.       Over the years, he wrote books and journal articles, and      taught agribusiness as a visiting scholar at Harvard Business      School.       In 2007, Schumacher, along with Cathy Bertini, former      Director of the World Food Programme and Professor Robert      Thompson, Gardner Professor of Agricultural Economics at      Illinois, oversaw the preparation of the Task Force Report of      the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, titled ``Modernizing      America's Food and Farm Policy: Vision for a New Direction''.       In 2013, Mr. Schumacher received the James Beard      Foundation's Leadership Award for ``his lifelong efforts to      improve access to fresh local food in underserved      communities.''       In Boston, the Globe wrote about a time several years ago      when Mr. Schumacher, dining out at tony Hamersley's Bistro,      sat down at a table, reached into a brown paper bag and      pulled out a shiny, ripe red tomato. He asked for a serrated      knife, olive oil and a plate, then proceeded to make himself      a salad. ``Who's this guy who's making his own salad?'' chef-     owner Gordon Hamersley wanted to know. His own tomatoes came      from California. Where had Mr. Schumacher's come from?      ``Twenty minutes from your doorstep,'' Mr. Schumacher said.                             miscellaneous       He chastised breakfast diners for serving English jellies      instead of American ones.       Mr. Schumacher made personal deliveries of Asian greens      that included pea tendrils, Chinese chive blossoms and      Cambodian spearmint to the Washington restaurant TenPenh.       For fun, Mr. Schumacher restored cider mills.       Schumacher was a member of the 21st National Academy of      Sciences.                  [From The Washington Post, Sept. 27]   Gus Schumacher, a Force in the Farm-to-Table Movement, Dies at 77                            (By Bart Barnes)       Gus Schumacher, a fourth-generation farmer and third-     ranking official at the Agriculture Department, told the      story of his epiphany about food hundreds of times.       It was the end of a summer afternoon in 1980 at a farmers      market in Boston, and he was helping his brother load up his      truck with unsold produce grown on their family property in      Lexington, Mass. The bottom fell out of a box of pears,      scattering the fruit into the gutter.       There, a young mother with two little boys eagerly gathered      them into the folds of her unhemmed shirt. She was a single      mom, she explained, dependent on food stamps, which back then      made fresh fruit and vegetables prohibitively expensive for      her. The pear spill was a bonanza.       For Mr. Schumacher, he would say later, it was a seminal      moment in his life. He grew up on a farm, and it had never      occurred to him that parents would find it hard to provide      their children with fresh fruit and vegetables.       He would change it, he told himself.       Mr. Schumacher--who in a 50-year career also served as the      Massachusetts commissioner of food and agriculture, a food      project manager and agriculture development officer for the      World Bank and finally a co-founder of a nonprofit group that      tries to improve affordable access to fresh, locally grown      food--died Sept. 24 at his home in Washington. The cause was      an apparent heart attack, said his wife, Susan Holaday      Schumacher. He was 77.       Since that farmers-market epiphany, Mr. Schumacher helped      make food assistance programs more generous in allowances for      fresh fruit and vegetables. He also became a force in the      farm-to-table movement, encouraging restaurants and retail      stores to buy produce locally.       In 2013, Mr. Schumacher received the James Beard      Foundation's Leadership Award for ``his lifelong efforts to      improve access to fresh local food in underserved      communities.''       In Boston, the Globe wrote about a time several years ago      when Mr. Schumacher, dining out at tony Hamersley's Bistro,      sat down at a table, reached into a brown paper bag and      pulled out a shiny, ripe red tomato. He asked for a serrated      knife, olive oil and a plate, then proceeded to make himself      a salad.       ``Who's this guy who's making his own salad?'' chef-owner      Gordon Hamersley wanted to know. His own tomatoes came from      California. Where had Mr. Schumacher's come from?       ``Twenty minutes from your doorstep,'' Mr. Schumacher said.       That scene, or a version of it, would play over and over      again between 1984 and 1990 when Mr. Schumacher was      agriculture chief for Massachusetts. He was always asking      chefs whether they knew any farmers who could supply them      food directly. He created market coupon programs for seniors      and low-income families with children. He chastised breakfast      diners for serving English jellies instead of American ones.       ``Gus was instrumental in bringing two seemingly obvious      groups together who never talked to each other--chefs and      farmers,'' Hamersley told the Globe. ``He's basically the      architect of chefs featuring locally grown produce. As      always, there was a team of people with him, but he was      sitting in the chair.''       The Washington Post reported on Mr. Schumacher's work with      refugee and immigrant farmers all over the United States. He      encouraged them to grow and market their native vegetables,      such as amaranth. From New England, the New York Times      reported, Mr. Schumacher made personal deliveries of Asian      greens that included pea tendrils, Chinese chive blossoms and      Cambodian spearmint to the Washington restaurant TenPenh.       August Schumacher Jr. was born in Lincoln, Mass., on Dec.      4, 1939. He grew up on a farm in Lexington, and his father      was one of the largest parsnip growers in Massachusetts. His      grandfather and great-grandfather were farmers in New York      City. They grew winter vegetables in glass-enclosed      hothouses.       Mr. Schumacher graduated from Harvard University in 1961      and attended the London School of Economics.       Over his career, he had a variety of consultancies, served      as Massachusetts agriculture chief from 1984 to 1990 and was      the USDA undersecretary of agriculture for farm and foreign      agricultural services from 1997 to 2001.       Since 2008 he had served as founding board chairman of      Wholesome Wave in Bridgeport, Conn., which seeks to increase      access to affordable, locally grown fruits and vegetables.       His first marriage, to Barbara Kerstetter, ended in      divorce. Survivors include his wife of 25 years, Susan      Holaday Schumacher of Washington; a stepdaughter, Valarie      Karasz of Brooklyn; and two grandchildren. A stepson, Andrew      Karasz, died earlier this month.                          ____________________
