President, today I am introducing a resolution that spells out what I believe should be the basic rights of consumers to use and enjoy legally acquired copyrighted works. The purpose of this resolution is simple: to establish the principle that as the Nation's copyright system evolves and adapts to new technologies, it must respect and preserve the interests of consumers. I am joined in this effort by my friend and frequent collaborator, Representative Chris Cox, who has already introduced a similar resolution in the House.  In today's information age, intellectual property rules are the oil that helps keep the economic engine running smoothly. Digitization and the rise of the Internet have given the engine a big boost by creating new and more efficient ways of circulating, manipulating, and using information. The pace of these developments has left the copyright system scrambling to keep up.  Industry working groups have been meeting over the past several years to negotiate new copy protection rules, but consumers have not always had a prominent seat at the table, and there is a real risk that the interests of consumers could get short shift. That is why I believe it is important to affirm that new copyright protection systems must not be allowed to undermine or erode the existing rights and expectations of consumers. Existing copyright laws, under the doctrine of ``fair use,'' permit consumers to make copies of content for limited, non-commercial purposes. A new copyright regime for the digital world must not narrow or limit these rights. It would be a terrible irony if the advances in digital technology were to result in a step backwards for consumers.  I expect to see a great deal of activity on this subject during the next Congress--on the legislative front certainly, but also in further negotiations between industry groups and in efforts to devise new technological approaches. To ensure that the scope of ``fair use'' in the digital world will not be any narrower than it has been in the analog world, I believe it would be helpful for Congress to spell out its expectations concerning what legitimate fair use includes. That is what this resolution aims to do. Specifically, it says that consumers of legally acquired content should be permitted to make copies for purposes of using the content later (time-shifting), using it in a different place (space shifting), or making a backup; to use the content on different platforms or devices; to translate the content into different formats; and to use technology to achieve any of these purposes. Copyright law should not give copyright holders the ability to prohibit such legitimate, personal, non-commercial activity.  It is clear to me that the content industries face very serious challenges in preventing piracy, and that intellectual property protections must be strong. People and companies that create copyrighted works must be fairly compensated, and piracy must be punished. America's information-based economy depends on it.  But efforts to combat piracy must not come at the expense of legitimate consumer uses of intellectual property. That would be throwing out the baby with the bathwater.  I understand that the content industries have serious concerns about this resolution. I have listened to them, and I can appreciate theirs fear that, for example, expressing consumer rights in too absolute a fashion could open the door to someone making 1,000 copies of a CD to share with all their friends and acquaintances at no charge. That is not my intention. So the resolution I am introducing specifies that the rights in question must be exercised in a reasonable, personal, and non-commercial manner. The rights are not absolute.  Going forward, I intend to continue to listen to both sides of this debate, and to support solutions that do not upset the balance in existing law between commercial use and non-commercial, personal use. I want to protect the interests of both copyright holders and consumers. But the fact is, as of today, nobody in the Senate has stepped forward with legislation on the consumer side of this issue. This resolution helps fill that void.  Introducing this resolution now, with the end of this Congress drawing near, Congressman Cox, and I are essentially laying down a marker for next year's debate. I will work closely with my Chairman on the Senate Commerce Committee, Senator Hollings, and others to move the issue forward. A positive expression affirming the reasonable interests of consumers should be part of this Nation's evolving copyright regime.                          ____________________
