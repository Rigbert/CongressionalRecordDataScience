I thank Senator Bennett for the contribution he has made. I hope he understands my position--I cannot speak for others--once this nominee has made full disclosure--his legal background, opinions, memoranda, his answer to questions--frankly, I would view him as other nominees. I may vote for him or against him. I think I voted against 6 out of 103 of President Bush's nominees. I have not made a pattern of this, but some disagree with this thought. I think that is where we are leading to. I hope that is where we are leading to.  More importantly, I hope the Senator from Utah understands why we are doing this.
