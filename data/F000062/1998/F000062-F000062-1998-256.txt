 President. I thank both the Senator from Arizona and the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin for their yeoman's work, their perseverance and their energy on behalf of this cause.  I am one who, in a very short period of time, has had to raise very large amounts of money for political campaigns. And I am one who has watched and seen the evolution of soft money and what that soft money has wrought upon the American political system.  So I rise today to join with my colleagues in very staunchly supporting the McCain-Feingold legislation.  Since the 1996 election, Members of Congress and the public have repeatedly called for reform of what is, without question, a broken system.  Congress had ample opportunity to pass this bill last October, but, shamefully, after so much talk, there was still no action to back it up. It should be no source of pride for this body to know that the public believes that Congress is all talk and no action on an issue that has dominated the Washington agenda for the last year and a half.  Now we have an opportunity to put our votes where our mouths are when it comes to campaign spending reform and, if nothing else, vote to ban soft money.  It is interesting to read the newspapers where Member of Congress after Member of Congress admits to the vicissitudes and the problems of soft money. For the first 6 months of 1997, the Republican Party raised $21.7 million and the Democrats $13.7 million. Both of these figures are increases over the 1995-1996 cycle, and both are sure to rise in the coming months.  While many in this body would like to see stronger legislation, and some would like to see no legislation at all, it is important to note that McCain-Feingold is essentially a stripped-down bill, pared to address a number of the most pressing issues. The most important aspect is soft money.  Last fall, we had a healthy debate about the amounts of soft money flowing in and out of party coffers, so I am not going to speak at length about that. But without reform, we can expect soft money expenditures to rocket up with no brakes.  The Court's decision in the Colorado case opens the door to unlimited independent party spending on behalf of candidates running for office as long as those expenditures are not coordinated with the candidates.  Prior to the Colorado decision, parties long supported their candidates with hard money. Those were the regulated dollars. In our case, limited to $1,000 contribution per election.  Increasingly, though, candidate advocacy has fallen to soft money, and that is money contributed in unlimited, unregulated amounts from seldom-disclosed sources.  Increasingly, the form that soft money takes is in scurrilous, vituperate ads that are often far different than reality. I believe that goes for both sides of the aisle. I think it is a scourge on our American political system.  We have an opportunity today to say we ban soft money and to limit express advocacy to a certain length of time prior to the election so that the opportunity for untrue, false and often defamatory ads is greatly reduced. If this bill were to do nothing else, I think that would be an enormous contribution to the political culture of a campaign.  One of the reasons, Mr. President, I did not cast my hat in the California gubernatorial campaign is because of the specific nature of campaigns today. There is very little that is uplifting about them.  The McCain-Feingold bill bans soft money and prohibits parties from funneling money to outside groups and would prohibit party officials from raising money for such groups.  Instead, these groups--and there are similar advocacy groups on both sides--would have to raise money from individual contributors or from PACs to raise money.  There is nothing in the bill barring these groups from continuing to participate in campaigns, but the bill does prohibit these outside groups from serving as de facto party adjuncts funded by the parties.  Also, this bill does nothing to prevent individuals from making unlimited contributions to advocacy groups, it merely requires them to report their contributions.                          unregulated spending  This brings me to the critical issue of unregulated spending. This is, essentially, unlimited and undisclosed soft money spent outside the party system.  A study released last fall by the Annenberg Public Policy Center estimated that over two dozen independent groups spent between $135 million to $150 million on so-called issue advertising during the 1996 election cycle.  Of the ads that were reviewed, 87 percent mentioned clearly identified candidates and a majority of those ads were negative.  Most of the time we don't know where these ads come from or who pays for them. All we see are vicious personal attack ads which pop up on television during a campaign and, occasionally, a follow-up newspaper article or report claiming credit and detailing the particulars of the attack.  Let me give you some examples of what I am talking about:  This is an issue ad that ran in the last Virginia Senate election. It was placed by a group called Americans for Term Limits:       Announcer: It's a four letter word. It's a terrible thing.      It's really a shame it's so widespread. It's here in      Virginia. The home of Washington and Jefferson . . . of all      places. The word is D-E-F-Y. Defy. That's what Senator X is      doing. He's defying the will of the people of Virginia and      America. By a five to one margin, the people who pay Warner's      salary support Congressional term limits. Yet Warner is      defying the people's will on term limits--on important and      needed reform. Senator X has refused to sign the U.S. Term      Limits Pledge and has promised to fight against enactment of      Congressional term limits. An 18-year Congressional      incumbent, Senator X, is defying the clearly expressed wishes      of the people he's supposed to represent. Call Senator X and      ask him to stop defying the will of the people on term      limits. Your action can make a difference. Tell Senator X to      sign the U.S. Term Limits Pledge.  The AFL-CIO ran the following ad in its much publicized campaign:       Announcer: Working families are struggling. But Congressman      X voted with Newt Gingrich to cut college loans, while giving      tax breaks to the wealthy. He even wants to eliminate the      Department of Education. Congress will vote again on the      budget. Tell Congressman X, don't write off our children's      future.  Both of these ads are clearly designed to get voters to support one candidate--or in both of these to oppose a specific candidate--and both mention candidates by name.  Yet, both are artfully crafted to elude campaign disclosure laws because neither use the ``magic words'' that would make them express advocacy and subject to campaign finance laws. The ``magic words'' outlined in a footnote on the Buckley case are ``vote for,'' ``elect,'' ``support,'' ``cast your ballot for,'' ``Smith for Congress,'' ``vote against,'' ``defeat,'' and ``reject.''  McCain-Feingold modernizes the definition of express advocacy and adds to its current definition the criterion of using a candidates name in advertisements within 60 days of an election.  What this means is that campaign advertisements that use a candidate's name within 60 days of the election would be considered express advocacy and could not be funded with unregulated and undisclosed money.  Instead, groups wanting to expressly advocate the election or defeat of an identified candidate would have to abide by federal campaign finance laws, raise hard money to fund their attacks and disclose the donors.  Will this have a dramatic impact? The answer is unequivocally yes.  Candidate ads that name names and run within 60 days of the election will be recognized for the express advocacy they are and would be subject to funding limits and reporting requirements. issue ads meant to educate voters on the issues will still be permitted as long as they do not cross the line.  Last month, a Wisconsin court looked at exactly this issue: if the state can crack down on advertisements clearly designed at influencing the election, but that stop short of requesting voters to support or oppose candidates.  The debate in the Court mirrors exactly what the issue is here. Wisconsin Attorney General James Doyle said in a Washington Post article:       The heart of this issue is if you run an ad that any      reasonable person who looks at it recognizes to be a      political ad, just before an election, in which you call a      particular person names, and use phrases like ``send a      message'' to that person but do not use the magic words      ``vote for'' or ``vote against,'' whether you can then avoid      all the basic campaign finance laws that we have in the      state.  That is what we're looking at here and that is exactly the issue we have before us.                   Other Noteworthy Areas in the Bill  There are some other areas of the bill which, I believe, enhance accountability for how campaign money is spent.  Requiring candidates to attest to the content of ads they fund. I would like to see this go one step further and require candidates to attest to the veracity of independent ads that are run on their behalf. The problem lies not with the candidates, but with these anonymous attack ads.  Leveling the playing field between self-financed candidates and candidates who rely on contributions. This bill prohibits parties from making coordinated expenditures on behalf of candidates who spend more than $50,000 of their own money. I would like to see a mechanism whereby we would raise individual contribution limits for candidates running against self-financed candidates.  Lowering the disclosure requirement for contributions to candidates from $200 to $50.  Requiring that any person (including political committees, i.e. unions, corporations, and banks) making independent expenditures over $10,000 (aggregate) prior to 20 days before an election, file a report with the FEC within 48 hours.  Requiring that any person (including political committees, i.e. unions, corporations, and banks) making independent expenditures over $1,000 within 20 days of an election report that expenditure to the FEC within 24 hours.  Requiring individuals making disbursements of over $50,000 annually (aggregate) file with the FEC on a monthly basis.                               Conclusion  It is important to note that nothing in this bill prohibits any type of speech. We are all aware of the Court's guarantee in Buckley that spending is the equivalent of speech. With the exception of banning parties receiving soft money, nothing in this bill limits how much can be spent on campaigns.  This legislation seeks to hold candidates accountable for what they say, how they say it and, most importantly, how far unregulated special interests are allowed to go in paying to impact elections.  This bill gives Congress the opportunity to make a real difference. I hope we will have that chance.
