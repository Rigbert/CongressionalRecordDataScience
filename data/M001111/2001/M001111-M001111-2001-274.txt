 I know many parents today with young children who are 2 and 3 years old are now trying to get their kids into private school. They are starting the application process already. It is very difficult to get into some of our best private schools. Imagine parents out there who are listening to rhetoric about a voucher program as some kind of magic bullet that their child will use to get into a private school, and that is not correct. In fact, private schools can say they will not take children with disabilities or with limited English proficiency or with the difficulties that they have experienced in the past.  So it is an empty promise to many parents who are thinking it is some kind of panacea--a voucher system that all of a sudden they will receive as taxpayers. The good private schools are hard to get into. We all know not all private schools are created equal. There are good ones and there are some not so good. This money would apply to all of them. I think we would lose for a lot of taxpayers in this country and our public school systems will lose even more.
