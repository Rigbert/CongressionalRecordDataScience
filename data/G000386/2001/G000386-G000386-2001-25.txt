 President, today Senator Kerry and I introduced bipartisan legislation that will provide some relief to those workers who are facing a massive tax bill on the phantom income they have from incentive stock options.  Because it is important that my colleagues understand the unfairness of this matter, let me provide a very brief background.  Incentive stock options ISO, are an option given by an employer to an employee to purchase stock at a certain price. An individual does not recognize any income on the grant of the option or exercise thereof if the individual holds the shares for more than 2 years after grant and 1 year after exercise. If the holding period requirements are satisfied, the employee is taxed on the excess of the sale price over the exercise price on his disposition of the shares.  The reason these employees have such a significant tax bill is due to the workings of the Tax Code's answer to Rube Goldberg, the Alternative Minimum Tax, AMT. The employee's nonrecognition of income discussed above does not apply for AMT purposes. For AMT purposes, the code requires the recognition of the excess for the stock's fair market value on the date of exercise over the option price when the stock is substantially vested. Thus, while an employee does not have a tax liability of ordinary income for exercising his ISO the employee may be subject to AMT when he exercises his ISO.  While in years past, this may not have been too great a problem in a time when share prices are increasing and individuals have the money to pay the AMT. It is a very different story when shares are declining. The individual is then facing the AMT charges based on the exercise value but often has no funds to pay the AMT since the stock that was the source of the AMT has declined in value since it was exercised.  It is true that if the individual had sold the stock in the same year he exercised his ISO he would have potentially reduced his AMT liability significantly. However, the code sends a mixed signal to the individual telling him that he must hold the stock for one year after exercise if he wants to avoid taxation at ordinary income on the value at the point of exercise.  The above are the facts of the tax code, but they do not reflect the very real disaster this has done to many people across the country. The story of one company in Cedar Rapids, IA, McLeod USA, puts a real face on how this tax has destroyed families. I have received letters from dozens of honest hard-working people of this company telling me how they are making a good salary in Iowa, say $50,000 or $70,000, and were also given these ISOs as an additional incentive to work for McLeod. Now, because of the AMT rules and the declining market, these families are facing tax bills of tens of thousands, if not over a hundred thousand dollars. It is wiping out a lifetime of savings and hardwork, all to pay a tax bill on phantom income, income they never received, never enjoyed and never had. It is outrageous and it is just plain wrong.  The bill that Senator Kerry and I have introduced will provide significant relief from the AMT tax bill for workers. It allows employees to determine the value of their stock options on April 15, 2001, (as opposed to the exercise date), which will reflect the downturn of the market. This will go far in minimizing the AMT hit that employees face. In addition, the relief is targeted to assist low-income and middle-income families.  I hope my colleagues will join myself and Senator Kerry to put an end to this tax disaster.  I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1831       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX RELIEF WITH RESPECT TO                    INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING 2000.       (a) In General.--In the case of an incentive stock option      (as defined in section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of      1986) exercised during calendar year 2000, the amount taken      into account under section 56(b)(3) of such Code by reason of      such exercise shall not exceed the amount that would have      been taken into account if, on the date of such exercise, the      fair market value of the stock acquired pursuant to such      option had been its fair market value as of April 15, 2001      (or, if such stock is sold or exchanged on or before such      date, the amount realized on such sale or exchange).       (b) Limitation.--       (1) In general.--If the adjusted gross income of a taxpayer      for the taxable year in which an exercise described in      paragraph (1) occurs exceeds the threshold amount, the amount      otherwise not taken into account under paragraph (1) shall be      reduced by the amount which bears the same ratio to such      amount as the taxpayer's adjusted gross income in excess of      the threshold amount bears to the phaseout amount.       (2) Threshold amount.--For purposes of this subsection, the      threshold amount is equal to--       (A) $106,000 in the case of a taxpayer described in section      1(a) of such Code,       (B) $84,270 in the case of a taxpayer described in section      1(b) of such Code, and       (C) $53,000 in the case of a taxpayer described in section      1(c) or 1(d) of such Code.       (3) Phaseout amount.--For purposes of this subsection, the      phaseout amount is equal to--       (A) $230,000 in the case of a taxpayer described in section      1(a) of such Code,       (B) $172,500 in the case of a taxpayer described in section      1(b) of such Code, and       (C) $115,000 in the case of a taxpayer described in section      1(c) or 1(d) of such Code.                                 ______                                       By
