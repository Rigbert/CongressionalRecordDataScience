Speaker, it is with great respect and admiration that I stand before you today to honor Mr. Larry Sharp, Executive Director of the International Institute/LACASA--IILC, an organization that specializes in assisting individuals with immigration and citizenship concerns. For over 30 years, Larry has devoted his time and efforts to this organization, touching the lives of countless individuals. Mr. Sharp will be honored for his many years of service at an event hosted by the Gary Historical and Cultural Society, Inc., on Saturday, April 9, 2011, at the Genesis Convention Center in Gary.  Founded in 1919, the International Institute's main purpose was to assist foreign born individuals in their adjustment to American life by providing home visits with bilingual volunteers and workers. Continuing on this path, the organization continued to enhance the services it offered, and the Institute organized the first English classes for the foreign born. In 1945, a major focus of the organization was immigration and naturalization, and in 1958, the International Institute was accredited by the Board of Immigration Appeals to represent individuals before the Department of Homeland Security. In 2002, the International Institute and LACASA, an organization serving the Hispanic community, merged to form what is now known as the International Institute/LACASA and is also known as the International Community Alliance. Today, the organization's mission is to ``serve and advocate for low and moderate-income immigrants and Hispanics in immigration, naturalization, adult education, youth leadership development, food assistance, confronting domestic abuse, promoting cultural diversity, and fatherhood programs.''  Larry Sharp was born in LaPorte, Indiana, and is a graduate of Ball State University. He joined the Peace Corps in 1969 and was stationed in Peru. There, he learned to speak Spanish and met the love of his life, his wife, Taia Caroll. In 1979, Larry became Executive Director of the International Institute. Since 1982, Larry has been accredited by the Board of Immigration Appeals to represent individuals. Mr. Sharp continues to directly assist numerous people with citizenship and immigration issues daily. Through Larry's outstanding leadership and incredible passion, the International Institute/LACASA, has become an effective and compassionate program for all immigrants who need support.  Larry's dedication to the community and his career is exceeded only by his devotion to his amazing family. Larry and his wonderful wife, Taia, have two children, Neil and Taia.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending Mr. Larry Sharp as he is honored for his lifetime of service and dedication to foreign born individuals within the communities of Northwest Indiana, Illinois, and beyond. Larry continues to touch the lives of countless people, and for his unselfish, lifelong commitment, he is worthy of the highest praise.                          ____________________
