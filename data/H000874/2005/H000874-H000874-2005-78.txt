 The purpose of a motion to instruct conferees is obviously to convey to them the opinion of the House as it relates to the product of the conference. Clearly, if that motion is not made until essentially after the conference work is done, the motion essentially is of little, if any, value. I understand theproblem that the majority has been dealing with and the differences between the administration and at least the Senate. But it does place us in a position where essentially whatever the House might want to do on a motion to instruct would be essentially a meaningless act.  That is certainly not, I think, the intent of the rule for a motion to instruct, nor is it the spirit, I think, of the rule. The gentleman does not have to comment on it. If he wanted to make a comment on it, I would be glad to hear it; but I think you understand our consternation for those of us who particularly feel very strongly on the importance and the appropriateness of the McCain amendment as passed by the Senate being in the final bill. Again, the gentleman does not have to comment on that. If he would like to, I will certainly yield.
