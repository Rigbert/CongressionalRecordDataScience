 LOTT. I yield to the Senator from Kentucky.  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to the majority leader, Senator Glenn suggested that my amendment will require 30 minutes, 15 minutes on a side, and then he wanted 30 minutes for his amendment. I had offered him earlier in the day that we could adopt them both on voice vote which will require no time at all for the Senate. If I understand the Glenn amendment, it is adding $2.8 million for the FEC; is that the Glenn amendment?
