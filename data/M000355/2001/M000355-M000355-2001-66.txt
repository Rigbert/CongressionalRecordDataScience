 1484. A bill to prevent fraud in the solicitation of charitable contributions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Nation's armies of compassion have rallied in response to the events of September 11 and thus far have contributed more than $676 million to our Nation's charities. But this largess have proven an irresistible target to criminals who prey upon the generous and good-hearted nature of Americans in this time of national emergency. We heard reports of false charities exploiting well-intentioned Americans during the Gulf War and after the Oklahoma City bombing and we now hear similar reports that the September 11 attacks have given these unusually heartless criminals new opportunities to perpetrate fraud.  Almost daily we hear of American citizens receiving solicitations from phony charities. News reports from more than a dozen States, from New York to Florida to California, reveal that Americans are being asked to contribute to what turn our to be bogus victim funds, phony firefighter funds and questionable charitable organizations. The fraudulent solicitation of charitable contributions is a problem all across our Nation.  Well-meaning Americans unwittingly contribute an estimated $1.5 billion per year in contributions to fraudulent charities. This $1.5 billion is intended to feed rescue workers, shelter the homeless, and care for those who have lost loved ones. Instead, this money is siphoned into the pockets of cold-hearted criminals. In the wake of the September 11 attacks, the amount of misappropriated contributions will surely increase. The Better Business Bureau reports that inquiries from consumers about dubious fund-raising practices have increased approximately 40 percent since September 11. Unfortunately, these criminals frequently prey upon our Nation's seniors, whose fervent patriotism and generous hearts can make them easy marks for a grifter's scam.  These crooks often try to confuse their victims by using names that sound like reputable charities and relief efforts. For example, some scam artists ask for donations to the Red Cross of America or the Armenian Red Cross, not the legitimate relief organization known the world over as the American Red Cross. Other crooks use the name ``firefighter fund'' or ``victim's survivors fund'' in their fraudulent appeals.  While an informed donor is the first line of defense against sham solicitors, there also are steps Congress should take in addressing this problem. Current Federal law targets fraudulent solicitations and telemarketing scams related to the sale of products and services and sweepstakes and contests, but does not specifically cover the fraudulent solicitation of charitable contributions. That is why I rise today to offer legislation, the Crimes Against Charitable Americans Act, which would authorize law enforcement and regulatory agencies to specifically target these fraudulent solicitation.  My bill, the Crimes Against Charitable Americans Act, strengthens Federal law by first, making it a Federal crime to fraudulent solicit charitable contributions or donations. This crime would be punishable by a fine and imprisonment for 5 years, or both, and those convicted would be ordered to provide restitution to their victims. Second, my bill increases the penalty from 1 year to 5 years for those convicted of impersonating members or agents of the Red Cross in order to solicit contributions. Third, my bill directs the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal agency with primary enforcement against consumer fraud, to include charitable solicitations within its definition of telemarketing and to promulgate rules designed to end such fraudulent practices. These FTC regulations also give local and state officials the authority to persecute violators, which will increase the possibility that scam artists will be caught and punished. Finally, this legislation broadens the definition of telemarketing in federal law to include charitable solicitations and provides for up to a 10-year sentence enhancement for anyone who fraudulently solicits charitable contributions in connection with the commission of other Federal crimes. This maximum sentence enhancement of 10 years is reserved for those criminals who target our generous seniors with fraudulent appeals for money.  There are more than half-a-million federally recognized charities in America that raised more than $200 billion in contributions last year. Those who seek to profit from tragedy, especially the events of September 11, deserve a special degree of society's scorn and a special punishment under federal law. Not only do they steal valuable resources from the most worthy of recipients, but they erode the trust of the American people in legitimate charitable organizations. America is a generous and compassionate Nation and we must preserve the integrity of our charities and their ability to help others. The Senate can protect the noble work of our Nation's charities by passing the Crimes Against Charitable Americans Act.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, a letter of endorsement from the Bluegrass Area Chapter of the American Red Cross, and information sheets from the Federal Trade Commission and the AARP about fraud and charitable donations be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill and the additional material were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1484       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell, I have reviewed your proposed Crime      Against Charitable Americans Act of 2001 and on behalf of the      Bluegrass Area Chapter of the American Red Cross fully      endorse your efforts.       Whether handling donated funds or fees for products and      services, upholding the public's trust is critically      important to the Red Cross. The Red Cross is committed to      high standards of financial stewardship and those who      fraudulently solicit charitable contributions or donations      erode the basic foundations of our organization.       I commend you for stepping forward in this effort to stop      those who breed on opportunities of national disaster for      personal gain. If I can be of assistance in promoting this      act, let me know.           Sincerely,                                                      Paul B. Hay,     Executive Director.                                  ____ Helping Victims of the Terrorist Attacks: Your Guide to Giving Wisely       In the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks on the      World Trade Center and the Pentagon, Americans are opening      their hearts and wallets to help the nation recover. If      you're thinking about donating to the cause, here are some      tips to help you give wisely:       Donate to recognized charities you have given to before.      Watch out for similar sounding names. Some phony charities      use names that sound or look for those of respected,      legitimate organizations.       Give directly to the charity, not solicitors for the      charity. That's because solicitors take a portion of the      proceeds to cover their costs. That leaves less for the      victims.       Do not give out personal or financial information--     including your Social Security number or credit card and bank      accounts numbers--to anyone who solicits a contribution from      you. Scam artists use this information to commit fraud      against you.       Check out charities. Contact the Better Business Bureau's      Wise Giving Alliance: 4200 Wilson Blvd, Suite 800, Arlington,      VA 22203; (703) 276-0100; www.give.org.       Don't give cash. For security and tax record purposes, pay      by check. Write the official name of the charity on your      check. Or you can contribute safety online through      www.libertyunites.org.       Ask for identification if you're approached in person. Many      states require paid fund-raisers to identify themselves as      such and to name the charity for which they're soliciting.       To report a fraud, contact the Federal Trade Commission      toll-free: 1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357) or use the      complaint form at www.ftc.gov. The FTC works for the consumer      to prevent fraudulent, deceptive and unfair business      practices in the marketplace and to provide information to      help consumers spot, stop and avoid them. The FTC enters      Internet, telemarketing, identify theft and other fraud      related complaints into Consumer Sentinel, a secure, online      database available to hundreds of civil and criminal law      enforcement agencies in the U.S. and abroad.                                  ____                 [From AARP Bulletin Online, Oct. 2001]               Tragedy Can be Opportunity for Con Artists       Be very cautious of anyone soliciting money to help      rescuers and victims of the recent tragic events in New York      and Washington, D.C. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and      other law enforcement agencies, are warning people about      phone calls, e-mails or any other attempts to obtain      donations.       Shortly after the tragedy, con artists claiming to      represent victims, firefighters, law enforcement or charities      were asking for money. If you want to donate, contact      legitimate charities yourself rather than responding to      requests.       Older consumers report that, on average, they get more than      six calls or letters seeking charitable donations every week.      That's more than 300 calls or letters every year. More than      two-thirds of older consumers are not confident that unknown      callers ``really represent the organization they say they      do.'' [For more information, visit the AARP website's      Telemarketing Fraud section.]                       tips for charitable giving       Before you give, get more information:       Ask the charity's full name, address and telephone number.       Ask how much of your donation goes to the program that the      request describes--and how much goes to administrative costs.       Call your state Attorney General or Secretary of State's      office to see if the charity is registered.       Depending on your state, charities must file financial and      other disclosure statements; get copies, and review them.       Don't provide your credit-card number or personal      information to telephone or e-mail solicitors.                    be sure you know who is calling       If a fundraiser calls, call the charity directly to ask if      it is really sponsoring a fundraising drive.       Also beware of phony charity names that sound similar to      legitimate organizations. Don't assume that you know a group      because the name or symbols seem familiar.                    protect your charitable dollars       To ensure that your contributions actually benefit those in      need, follow these guidelines:       Pay with a check or money order made out to the charity--     not the fundraiser itself.       Don't give money at the door to a courier or messenger--nor      by leaving a check under the doormat. Send your contribution      directly to the charity.       Don't feel pressured to make a donation on the spot. There      will be plenty of opportunities to contribute in the future.       Keep records of your donations and pledges, and check your      records if someone says you made a pledge that you don't      recall.       Know the difference between tax deductible and tax exempt.      Donations to tax-exempt organizations are not necessarily tax      deductible for you. If your donation is tax deductible, get a      receipt.                             online giving       The AARP Bulletin is providing links to some of the      legitimate charities collecting money to help the victims of      the September 11 tragedies.
