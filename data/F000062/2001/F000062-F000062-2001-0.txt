 President, I rise to express my sincere disappointment that the foreign operations conference report before us includes a provision that will suspend the certification process worldwide. This goes far beyond what this Senate passed just weeks ago.  The certification process is this Nation's best--and in many cases, only--mechanism to persuade problem nations to work with us as we try to stem the flow of illegal narcotics across our borders and onto our streets.  The purpose of the certification profess is not to punish any one individual country, but rather to hold all countries to a minimum standard of cooperation in the war against illegal drugs. In that regard, I believe it is the most effective system we have available to us. There simply is no alternative.  Many have tried to turn the certification issue into a simplistic clash between the United States and Mexico. To be sure, in the past that relationship has received the most attention.  But in fact, there are more than 30 countries that undergo an annual certification review under current law--including countries like Afghanistan, Syria, Iran, Burma, and even China.  Afghanistan, for instance, has been decertified 10 out of 12 times they have faced review. As a result, U.S. aid has been withheld from the Nation.  Burma, also, has been decertified 10 out of the 12 times it has faced review.  It is interesting to note that Mexico has never once been decertified.  So this is not a U.S.-Mexico issue. This is an issue affecting our global efforts to reduce the supply of drugs to the United States. Suspending the certification process worldwide means that countries failing to cooperate in the drug war will face no penalty for that failure. And that is a step we should not be taking.  Now is not the time to be letting up on the war on drugs.  The connection between terrorist and narcotics traffickers is real, and closer than ever before.  In Colombia, in Afghanistan, and in other places around the world, drug money helps terrorist organizations carry out violent, destructive, and even deadly acts of terror against citizens of the United States and other countries.  The Drug Enforcement Administration estimates that last year, Afghanistan supplied 70 percent of the world's opium. Money from the drug trade in Afghanistan helped keep the Taliban in power, and some of that money undoubtedly made it to the al Qaeda organization.  In Colombia, the FARC narco-terrorists make millions every year in extortion and protection money from drug traffickers. This money helps them maintain control over an area within Colombia the size of Switzerland, and funds activities that include kidnaping and even murder.  Even beyond the drug-terror connection, the drug trade around the world is ever-developing. Supplies of many drugs are near or at all time highs. In the last few years alone, the drug known as Ecstasy has become a virtual phenomenon among young people in this country, and is smuggled into the United States from countries as diverse as Mexico and the Netherlands, Belgium and Israel.  If anything, this administration and this Congress should be taking the certification process even more seriously--not moving to abandon it wholesale.  If anything, the real threat of decertification should be used more often as a tool to modify the behavior of problem nations, not less often.  To do as this conference report does and completely stop the certification process for all nations will essentially remove the one good means we have of encouraging foreign nations to work with us in reducing the supply of illegal drugs to the United States.  This moratorium is a mistake, plain and simple.  I do want to again stress that a partial moratorium is warranted, particularly for the government of Mexico. I believe that Mexican President Vicente Fox has shown a clear willingness to work with the United States in the drug war, much like the government of Colombia has over the last few years in the battle against strong drug cartels.  That is why a temporary moratorium on the certification process in this hemisphere makes some sense. And that is why I did not object to such a moratorium when this issue first came up on the floor of the Senate.  But expanding the moratorium to countries that have shown far less cooperation, and continue to do little to keep drug traffickers from producing drugs or moving drugs through their territory, is a step backward in the war against drugs.  I feel very strongly about this issue, and it is my belief that this provision may very well be an attempt by the opponents of the certification process to begin the process of dismantling certification altogether.  Well, let's just say that while I am happy to work with my colleagues to consider reasonable ways to address the certification issue--especially, in cases like Mexico, where the record may warrant changes--I intend to make sure that next year's foreign operations legislation does not reflect such a poorly conceived approach to this issue.
