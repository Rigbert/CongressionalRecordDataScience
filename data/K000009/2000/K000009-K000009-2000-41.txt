Speaker, I thank the kind gentleman from Texas (Mr. Stenholm) for yielding me a few brief moments here. I will not encroach on his time. I know he has been waiting. No one has been a finer leader on the issue of balancing our budget and getting the long-term debt and the annual deficits down than the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Stenholm). He has been a leader for all of us. So for him to yield me a few moments of his time this evening is a great privilege for me, and I thank the gentleman so very much.  Mr. Speaker, I wanted to enter some remarks in the Record here concerning the recent ruling by the Federal Trade Commission that was highlighted in the New York Times yesterday and in every major newspaper around the country with the headline: ``Violence in the Media is Aimed at the Young, Federal Trade Commission says. Report finds pervasive and aggressive marketing of films and video games to our youth.''  I am so concerned about this I will be sending parts of my remarks tonight to the gentleman who represents the motion picture industry here in Washington, Mr. Jack Valenti, along with the heads of all of our three major commercial networks, along with the heads of those that sponsor MTV in our country, to say that we are the most affluent society in the world; and yet we witness constantly school shootings, teens committing murders, first graders carrying guns into our schools to shoot fellow students.  We can all ask ourselves what is happening deep inside this society and why do we have to read about children committing crimes, violent crimes almost on a daily basis. With all the national reports indicating major crime is coming down in our country, why is it that parents in my neighborhood feel that they cannot allow their children to ride their bicycles more than two blocks away from the house because they fear for their lives and for their health?  We live in a very, very working-class normal community in our country where people go to work every day, where seniors reside and so forth.  Following the terrible events at Columbine High School last year, President Clinton ordered the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the role that the entertainment industry played in promoting youth violence. The report that came out by chairman Pitofsky of the Commission says, and I quote: ``For all three industry segments, the answer is yes. Targeted marketing to children of entertainment products with violent content is pervasive and aggressive. Whether we are talking about music recording, movies or computer games, companies in each entertainment segment routinely end run and thereby undermine parental warnings by target marketing their products to young audiences.''  I bring this up also because we did a recent survey in our office of constituents in our district asking them about television.                              {time}  1830  Seventy-three percent of the respondents graded the impact of television on America's youth as unwholesome with a negative impact on youth development. Moreover, when asked to list three major concerns facing our country, constituents in Ohio's Ninth District responded television, radio, and movies contributed to the moral debasement of our youth.  If that is not bad enough, and that is the reason I am down here tonight, I received this letter from the country of Ukraine this week from a religious leader in that country who says to me, ``Congresswoman, you know, there is a deep economical crisis in our country today. Social wounds are opened like crimes, alcoholism, prostitution, drugs, and much of the humanitarian help coming from all over the world is in the form of clothing and food and medical goods. But, please, there is a lot of bad, immoral, wild nourishment,'' and he puts those words in quotes,'' that comes here as an ultra modern one.  ``All this stinking mud that comes to Ukraine comes from America and from Europe. The cult of violence and pornography just fell as locusts onto our children's souls and their schools, their houses, and on the streets.  ``The television today is working for hell, straight. Children are unprotected as no one else.''  So I say to those in charge of the visual images put before the people of the world, when a Member of Congress receives a letter like this from a citizen in another country, I have to tell you, it is a heavy burden that we carry of true embarrassment.  How do we defend this not just here at home, but abroad? It is defenseless. You cannot be happy about any of this.  Do my colleagues know what he asks? And I am going to ask Mr. Valenti, I am going to ask the major media moguls of our country. He says, ``We need help with ethics in our schools. We need help with printingbooks to try to teach the youth here about our ethics. We need at least 10 copies of every book for every school library in our country. But, Congresswoman, publishing of these books on ethics cost money.  ``Can you help us? In the current situation here, we do not have the ability to help ourselves yet.''  He says, ``Please share our opinion and our longing and then we ask you to help us in this thing for the children's good.''  So I appreciate the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Stenholm) allowing me these few moments this evening.  I include this statement for the Record:       Dear Congresswoman Kaptur: I ask you hoping your helping      for us in the very necessary and important thing. ``Not with      the bread alone lives a man''--these words might be the title      of it.       There is a deep economical crisis in Ukraine now: a lot of      social wounds are opened like crimes, alcoholism,      prostitution, drugs etc. Much of the humanitarian help now      come here from all over the world. Most of it is clothes,      food, remedy, some goods. But, gentlemen, besides it there      are a lot of bad, immoral, wild ``spiritual'' nourishment      that comes here as an ultramodern one. All this ``stinking      mud'' comes to Ukraine from America and Europe. The cult of      violence and pornography just fell as locust onto children      souls in their schools, houses, on the streets. The      television today is working for hell, straight. Children are      unprotected. They, as none else, need the pure hopeful      spiritual nourishment. In the network of the secondary      schools is introduced such a subject as ethics--the very      important subject especially in the new democratic countries      of the Western and Middle Europe, as well as in the whole      world. But there is a lot of administrative formalism here.      We still don't have good books for pupils. Today we need at      least 10 copies of every book for every school library. We      work on this field a lot. But publishing of the thousands      books needs considerable cost.       Please share our opinion and our longing, then we ask you      to help us in this thing, for the greater God's glory and for      the children good.           With respect,                                                              S.P.  Mr. Speaker, I say to the Federal Trade Commission, be strong in what you do. Please help our country lead each of us to a better world for ourselves and for our children here at home and abroad.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman whose words of wisdom I know on our budget situation will also help lead us to a wiser course. He has been so responsible for the better situation in which we find ourselves.
