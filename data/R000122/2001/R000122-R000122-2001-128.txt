President, I rise today to introduce the Parent Act, which seeks to increase parental involvement in the educational lives of their children.  Research, experience, and reason tell us that providing parents with opportunities to play active roles in their children's schools empowers them to help their children excel. When parents are actively involved in their child's education, not only does their own child go further, but their child's school also improves to the benefit of all students. Indeed, as I have witnessed in Rhode Island, and I am sure my colleagues can attest to this in their states, our best schools are not simply those with the finest teachers and principals, but those which strive to engage parents in the education of their children.  Research shows that regardless of economic, ethnic, or cultural background, parental involvement is a major factor in determining a child's academic success. Parental involvement contributes to better grades and test scores, higher homework completion rates, better attendance, and greater discipline. Further, when parental involvement is a school priority, schools have fewer failing students, achieve better reputations in the community, and show improvements in staff morale.  In 1999, the American Association of School Administrators conducted a nationwide survey and found that 96 percent of parents believe that parental involvement is critical for a student to succeed in school and that 84 percent believe in parent involvement so strongly that they are willing to require such involvement. Further, a recent National PTA survey revealed that 91 percent of parents recognize that it is extremely important for parents to be involved in their children's school. Unfortunately, even as we extol the virtue of parental involvement, we must recognize that reality falls far short of that goal. The National PTA survey also found that roughly half the parents surveyed felt they were inadequately informed about ways in which they could participate in schools, or even gain access to basic information about their children's studies and their children's teachers. There are also other obstacles to greater parental involvement, such as working parents who find it difficult to get to schools and be involved or parents who have had negative schooling experiences and are wary of entering schools to participate in their children's education.  With more than 90 percent of parents believing that parental involvement is critical to a child's academic achievement and less than 50 percent of parents believing that their schools adequately involve them in their children's education, the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, ESEA provides an opportunity to help bring schools and parents together, and to ensure parents have the tools to become meaningfully and effectively involved in their children's education. While the ESEA currently contains parental involvement provisions, they mainly apply to Title I schools and students, and have not been fully implemented.  That is why I am pleased to be joined by Senators Wellstone and Murray and Representative Lynn Woolsey in the other body in introducing the Parent Act. This legislation would amend the ESEA to bolster existing, and add new, parental involvement provisions.  The Parent Act requires that all schools implement effective, research-based parental involvement best practices, and it provides technical assistance to schools that are having problems implementing parental involvement programs. My bill also seeks to improve parental access to information about their children's education and a school's parental involvement policies; ensure that professional development activities provide training to teachers and administrators on how to foster relationships with parents and encourage parental involvement; utilize technology to expand efforts to connect schools and teachers with parents; and promote parental involvement in drug and violence prevention programs. Further, the bill requires each local district to make available to parents an annual report card which explains how a school is performing with respect to student achievement, teacher qualification, class size, school safety, drop-out rates, the actions the school is taking to involve parents in school activities and decision making, and other school performance indicators.  The Parent Act also offers $500 million for school districts, with strict accountability measures, to supplement and support recognized and proven initiatives that improve student achievement through parental involvement. Currently, section 1118 of Title I requires districts to develop written parental involvement policies and requires schools to develop school-parent compacts, hold annual meetings for parents at schools, and involve parents in school review and improvement policies and plans. Local districts are required to spend 1 percent of their Title I allotment for this purpose, unless that 1 percent amounts to less than $5,000. In Rhode Island, however, in only 9 of the 34 districts that receive Title I funds is this amount above $5,000, and this situation is similar across the nation. In fact, the Final Report of the National Assessment of Title I found that a quarter of Title I schools do not have required school-parent compacts, more than four years after they were required. As Secretary Paige stated at his confirmation hearing, ``increased assistance will be needed'' to enhance parental involvement.  Last Congress, during the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee debate on ESEA, many provisions of the Parent Act were added to S. 2, the ESEA reauthorization bill. But S. 2 did not go far enough to ensure the parental involvement provisions of ESEA are actually implemented. The accountability provisions of the Parent Act and its grant resources are essential to making sure all of the elements for effective parental involvement are in place.  To succeed in the endeavor of increasing parental involvement, we must depend on parents, teachers, and school administrators throughout the country to work collaboratively to implement effective programs. However, federal leadership is needed to provide schools, teachers, and parents with the tools required for this task.  The bottom line of federal support for education is to increase studentachievement. Parental involvement is essential to ensuring that our students succeed. This legislation is strongly supported by the National PTA, and I urge my colleagues to join Senators Wellstone and Murray, Representative Woolsey, and me in supporting the Parent Act, and working for its inclusion in the ESEA reauthorization.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 372       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Parent Act of 2001''.     SEC. 2. REFERENCES.       Except as otherwise specifically provided, whenever in this      Act an amendment or repeal is expressed in terms of an      amendment to, or a repeal of, a section or other provision,      the reference shall be considered to be made to a section or      other provision of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act      of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.).     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Parents are the first and most influential educators of      their children.       (2) The Federal Government must provide leadership,      technical assistance, and financial support to States and      local educational agencies, as partners, in helping the      agencies implement successful and effective parental      involvement policies and programs that lead to improved      student achievement.       (3) State and local education officials, as well as      teachers, principals, and other staff at the school level,      must work as partners with the parents of the children they      serve.       (4) Research has documented that, regardless of the      economic, ethnic, or cultural background of the family,      parental involvement in a child's education is a major factor      in determining success in school.       (5) Parental involvement in a child's education contributes      to positive outcomes such as improved grades and test scores,      higher expectations for student achievement, better school      attendance, improved homework completion rates, decreased      violence and substance abuse, and higher rates of graduation      and enrollment in postsecondary education.       (6) Numerous education laws now require meaningful parental      involvement, including title I of the Elementary and      Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.), the      Goals 2000: Educate America Act (20 U.S.C. 5801 et seq.), the      Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. 9831 et seq.), and the Individuals      with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.), and      elements of these laws should be extended to other Federal      education programs.
