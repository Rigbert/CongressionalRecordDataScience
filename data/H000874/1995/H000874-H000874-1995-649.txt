Speaker, I had not intended to give a 1-minute, but I hear this carping about the balanced budget amendment. Twelve out of the last 14 years, we have had a Republican President. Not once, not once did any one of those Republican Presidents submit a balanced budget to the Congress of the United States, not once.  Second, one person, from 1982 to 1989, could have stopped spending in its tracks: Ronald Reagan.  And from 1989 to January 1993, one person, one person, one person could have stopped spending in its tracks: George Bush.  We went from a budget deficit of $945 billion in 1980 to a budget deficit of $4.5 trillion, 12 years into Republican leadership of the country.                          ____________________
