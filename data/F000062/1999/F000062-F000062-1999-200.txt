 President, I rise in support of legislation sponsored by Senator Schumer to phase out the antiquated sugar subsidy. The sugar program is nothing than a system of import restrictions, subsidized loans, and price supports that benefit a limited number of sugar growers.  I find it incredible that the federal government continues to support a subsidy program that is driving the domestic refinery industry out of existence and costing thousands of good jobs. The US Department of Agriculture restricts the amount of sugar available to domestic refineries. Without sugar, a sugar refinery cannot operate and that is the result of this misguided program.  It is clear that the U.S. sugar policy has served to strangle this country's sugar refining industry. By limiting the amount of raw cane sugar available for production, there has been a 40 percent decline in jobs in the sugar-cane refining industry. Since 1982, nine out of twenty one cane sugar refineries in the U.S. have been forced out of business. Those that have remained open are struggling to survive under onerous import restrictions.  I first became involved with this issue in 1994 when David Koncelik, the President and CEO of the California and Hawaiian Sugar Company, informed me that his refinery was forced to temporarily cease operations because it had no sugar.  This 93 year old refinery is the Nation's largest refinery and the only such facility on the West Coast. C refines about 15 percent of the total cane sugar consumed in the U.S.  C is capable of producing and selling 700,000 tons of refined sugar annually. Therefore, the company requires in excess of 700,000 tons of raw cane sugar to meet its sales demand.  Hawaii is C's sole source for its domestic raw cane sugar needs, but Hawaii's cane sugar industry has been in decline for over 10 years. This has meant that C is forced to cover over half its annual consumption through imports from other countries.  The highly restrictive sugar import system forces C to pay an inflated price for raw sugar from both domestic and foreign suppliers. Even more devastating, however, the quota system limits the amount of sugar available to the refinery. Simply put, C has been unable to get enough sugar to refine and it has been forced to close it doors on several occasions.  The reduced production capacity has resulted in a severe downsizing of the workforce. As recently as 1987, C employed over 1,400 people. These are not minimum wage jobs we are talking about: the average employee in the cane refining industry earns nearly $43,000 a year. In 1995, C had to eliminate 30 percent of its workforce just to remain viable under the quota system mandated by the sugar program.  C now employees just over 500 people. These jobs and many others around the nation are at risk if reforms are not made to the sugar program.  The overly restrictive manner that the USDA administers the sugar program has a number of other flaws. The sugar program's existing quota system was put in place in 1982, using trading patterns dating as far back as 1975. The system has remained largely unchanged over the past 17 years despite major alterations in the international sugar market. As a result, the current import quota system assigns export rights to countries that don't grow enough sugar to export or, in some cases, are net importers themselves.  For example, the Philippines are granted one of the largest export privileges under the sugar import quota system. It, however, does not even grow enough sugar to meet it own domestics needs. What this means is that the Philippines sell their homegrown sugar crop to the United States at about 22 cents a pound. It then buys raw sugar on the world market at around 5 cents a pound. This is ridiculous. We are in effect giving money to foreign countries and forcing domestic consumers to pay the price.  Beginning in September of 1994, I have asked the Administration on eight separate occasions to reform the sugar program. Simply increasing the amount of sugar available through the import program would provide immediate relief to C and the other domestic refineries. To date, no such permanent reform of the program has been made.  In addition to choking off the refineries' access to sugar, the US sugar policy also has an adverse impact on US consumers. The General Accounting Office has found that the program costs sugar users an average of $1.4 billion annually. That equates to $3.8 million a day in hidden sugar taxes.  The report found that ``Although the sugar program is considered a no-net-cost program because the government does not make payments directly to producers, it places the cost of the price supports on sweetener users--consumers and manufacturers of sweetener-containing products--who pay higher sugar and sweetener prices.''  What this means is that unlike traditional subsidy programs, the funds do not come directly from the Treasury. Instead, the sugar program places the cost consumers by restricting the supply of available sugar which causes higher domestic market prices.  The legislation we are introducing will eliminate the sugar subsidy program by 2002. This is a simple, straight-forward, and fair way to end a program that has not worked for U.S. consumers or workers.  Congress has had opportunities in the past to kill this program and we have not taken them. As a result, workers have lost jobs and consumers have lost money. I am pleased to join my colleagues in saying that enough is enough. It is time to end the sugar subsidy program once and for all.                                 ______                                       By
