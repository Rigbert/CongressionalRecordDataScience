 This is not a sham. And I would say to the leader, as he knows, he had an opportunity to vote on a DRILL Bill, Drill Responsibly in Currently Leased Land. He voted against that bill. A number of people in this Chamber voted against that bill. What that said is let's produce more product here in America.  What this bill says is, let's make sure that prices aren't being driven up artificially. No more, no less.  This summer the Democratic majority in this body has produced bill after bill after bill to address record oil prices that have exploded on this administration's watch. $1.46 to over $4 during the 7\1/2\ years of this administration.  Every one of us here, Democrats and Republicans, acknowledge that curbing our Nation's addiction to foreign oil, which is how President Bush himself characterized the situation, requires short-term solutions, and long-term strategy. And thus, this body has considered a bill that would increase production of more bio fuels here at home, and a second to incentivize the use of nonfood commodities to meet that goal. The chairman has been a leader in that effort, Chairman Peterson, along with Mr. Goodlatte. Appreciate both of their leadership.  We have considered a bill to hold OPEC accountable for price fixing, bills to address retail and wholesale price gouging, a bill to crack down on energy market manipulation, a bill to increase supply by suspending shipments to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and then another one to release oil from the Reserve; a bill to expedite the production of 10.6 billion barrels of Alaskan oil, to keep all oil produced in Alaska as well in the United States, and encourage diligent development of existing leases on Federal lands.  I tell my friends on the Republican side, when I use that phrase, ``diligent development'' that is lifted from their 2005 bill. We said ``use it or lose it,'' which was essentially the same thing, and they voted against it.  We have also considered a bill to bring down commuter rail and bus fares, and a bill to provide tax credits for renewable and alternative energy.  None of these bills, none of these bills, alone is a panacea. We all recognize that. And we all recognize that there will be no immediate solution.  But all of them, together, constitute a vital step towards confronting our oil dependency and our energy independence.  Many of these Democratic energy initiatives have passed the House. Some have become law. However, unfortunately, some have been blocked by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who seem to have one answer and one answer only to America's energy crisis, drill in places that are not now authorized.  I want to remind my colleagues there are currently some 88 million acres available for drilling. Experts tell us there are 107 billion barrels of oil available under those acres. We use, that would be a 14\1/2\ year supply. And what we have said is, pursue that. Drill. Produce that energy here in America for our use here in America.  Unfortunately, that bill was rejected by the overwhelming majority of the Republican Party. It is ironic, but Democrats generally agree with our Republican friends that increasing domestic production of our energy sources is critical. Both sides agree that we ought to get more energy from America. We agree that we ought to get more oil from America.  And unfortunately, when some of my Republican colleagues speak, they say, Democrats don't want to drill. That is absolutely not true, false, a misrepresentation said, in my opinion, for political purposes to accomplish an objective for politics, not for policy or for energy independence.  We must drill more, but we believe the oil companies which today have 68 million acres of land to drill on that is leased and open for drilling, must drill there first. Let's see if it is available there. If it is not, well perhaps let's look at alternatives.  In total, there are 311 million acres available for drilling, including 20 million in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. If they are serious about domestic production, they should be bringing these resources to market that we have leased in the public trust to produce oil and gas for the American people.                              {time}  1345  Today, I'm hopeful that Members on both sides of the aisle will again come together and support this legislation.  I want to congratulate Chairman Peterson. Chairman Peterson has had some of the biggest challenges in this year in the Congress of the United States, last year as well. The farm bill went a long period of time. The farm bill--which had significant energy components in it--and this bill, the Commodity Markets Transparency and Accountability Act. This bill is designed to control the market speculation that is artificially inflating the price of gas.  Among other things, this bill builds upon what we did in the farm bill, and closes overseas loopholes that allow speculation to go on unregulated; increases market transparency with strict reporting standards for traders; sets position limits to prevent individual speculators from dominating the market; and strengthens the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which is operating at its lowest ever staffing levels.  I tell my friends on both sides of the aisle if you take the referee off the field, the players are going to take an unfair advantage. You take the referees off the field, I guarantee the split ends are going to start down the field before the ball is hiked because he wants to get that advantage.  We've taken the referees off the field. This bill tries to put the referees back on the field. Even as trading volumes have increased 8,000 times since the Commodity Futures Trading Commission was first established--8,000 times--we have decreased their number of employees, their number of referees, if you will. Expert economists agree that unchecked, unregulated speculation is inflating the oil bubble and costing American consumers billions at the pump.  I urge my colleagues not for political reasons but for reasons of giving relief to our constituents, men and women trying to support their families who drive up to the pump and say to themselves, ``I can't afford this. I have gotto spend it but I can't afford it,'' let's put a stop to out-of-control speculation in the oil markets that is fueling this run-up in the cost of petroleum and harming consumers and the economy. Let's come together, as we have before, and pass this important energy legislation.  I have said something about Mr. Peterson. I want to say something about Mr. Goodlatte. I want to congratulate him for working together with Mr. Peterson to come up with a bill that can have bipartisan support, a bill which tries to effect reasonable, measured policy. I congratulate them both on this bill, and I urge my colleagues to pass this bill. It is not the only answer, but it is one of the pieces of the puzzle that we need to solve for all of our people.
