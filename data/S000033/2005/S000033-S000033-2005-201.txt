 Speaker, it is a pleasure, a great pleasure, for me to inform you, my colleagues in Congress, and through you the entire nation, about the kind of public service and dedication found in Vermont and, I suspect, in other villages, towns and cities throughout America.  Aileen O'Neil has been the town clerk of Woodford, Vermont for 36 years. For well over three decades she has met the needs of the people in her town of 421 citizens, keeping the town going and its records up to date. Her long and dedicated service was recently recognized by the Vermont Municipal Clerks and Treasurers Association, for they named her Vermont's Town Clerk of the Year.  During all of those 36 years Aileen O'Neil has done what needs to be done, with care, with courtesy, and with a concern for the public life we share with one another. What she told a newspaper reporter recently is a model for all of us, for I think each of us would like to be able to say, while still at work after so many years, ``I love my job. I've loved my job all these years. It's a purpose in life for me.''  We are lucky to have her, both as a town clerk in Woodford and as an example for all of us.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E2015]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                       DEDICATION TO A COMMUNITY                                 ______                                                           HON.
