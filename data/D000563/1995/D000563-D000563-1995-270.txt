Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Texas for taking this special order. I was back in my office going through my mail and I listened to her, and I said I want to come by and join my friend from Texas, because her message is my message. When you told the story about the college student loans, that touches me very, very deeply.  I was a recipient of Federal college student loans. My father passed away when I was a sophomore in high school. My mother was a payroll clerk for a railroad. We literally did not have the savings or resources to take care of my college education.  My mother and father had made it through the eighth grade. That was the extent of their education. They of course hoped I would do better, as every parent does. But when the time came to pay for those college expenses, I took a job, as every student would, and worked during the school year and during the summer months, and it just was not enough.  I got a little scholarship assistance here and there, but frankly had to turn to the U.S. Federal Government and something called the National Defense Education Act, that loaned me the money necessary to complete college and law school. It came to a grand total back in the 1960's of $7,500, which I thought was a mountain of debt I would never get out from under. Yet my wife and I worked and paid it off as we promised we would, so that younger kids behind us could have their opportunity.  When I listen to the proposals for budget deficit reduction from many of our friends among the Gingrich Republicans that suggest that we need to cut back on college student loans, that suggest we need to make the expense of a college education that much more for kids from working families, I think many of them have forgotten where they came from. They have forgotten that at a time in their life, this Government, this Nation, reached out a helping hand to them and was paid back in a great measure because for each of them who got that helping hand, there was an education, an opportunity, and I guess an opportunity to contribute to America, not only as a Member of Congress but in business and in so many different areas.  It seems to me so shortsighted for us to be cutting back on college student loans. I sincerely hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will remember how significant this is.  If I might mention one other point along these lines, 75 percent of the young people who graduate from high school are not going to end up graduating from college. They are going to go out in the work force looking for good-paying jobs. They will need other types of assistance, job training, to make sure that they are qualified for good-paying jobs.  I worry, too, as the gentlewoman points out the cutbacks that we are making in training and employment programs. She and I will be the first in line to suggest we need to modernize those programs, make them better.  I would commend to my friend from Texas, if she has not read it, a book by Hedrick Smith entitled ``Rethinking America,'' where he basically compares the educational systems in Germany, in Japan, and in the United States, and shows some real deficiencies in our system that need to be corrected. But we also have to understand that in those countries that are successful in taking kids right out of high school, putting them into good-paying jobs, career jobs, they have made a massive investment in training and education that is important to them.  Last week we had a debate here on a defense authorization bill, a question about building multibillion-dollar bombers.                              {time}  1900  Let me tell you, I think a few less bombers and a few more dollars spent on education and training would go a long way for a much more secure America in the future. The gentlewoman is right on track here, and I thank her for her leadership in this special order, and I will continue to stay here and join in, if I can, as she raises issues of mutual concern.
