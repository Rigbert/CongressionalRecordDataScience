Speaker, it is with great honor and enthusiasm that I congratulate the First Baptist Church in Hammond, Indiana as they celebrate the grand opening of their new auditorium. They will be celebrating this very momentous and special occasion on Sunday, March 20, 2005.  Allen Hill founded the First Baptist Church of Hammond, Indiana in 1887. The church has since met for services in five different auditoriums. The first auditorium was built in 1888 under Pastor Hewitt, and doubled in size under Pastor Carter in 1900. The third auditorium was constructed in 1913 under Pastor Adams. In 1959, Pastor Hyles became pastor, and under his leadership, in 1964, a new auditorium was constructed seating approximately 2000. The auditorium doubled in 1975.  Throughout the years Pastor Hyles dreamed of building a new auditorium. Sadly, he passed away in 2001. However, the determination of the church proved that although Pastor Hyles was now in heaven, the Lord of the Harvest was still alive and well. Pastor Schaap took the helm in March 2001, and he immediately led First Baptist Church to the next level. With the increased attendance, once again the congregation began to outgrow the auditorium. Ground was broken for the new auditorium on November 3, 2004.  From its modest beginning, First Baptist Church has emerged as a cornerstone of the community. Under Pastor Schaap's guidance, First Baptist continues to thrive, both in terms of spiritual growth as well as practical improvements. The proud members of the church are thankful for the spiritual and emotional leadership he and the previous pastors have provided during the years.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating the First Baptist Church of Hammond, Indiana on the grand opening of its new auditorium. They have provided support and guidance for all those in the community, and will continue to serve their community through their selfless dedication and commitment.                          ____________________
