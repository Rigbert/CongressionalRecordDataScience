 I think that is a very wise response, and I think it is a correct response. I think it does belong in the Foreign Relations Committee.  We have worked so hard to get a bill that could set a standard for this body so we could go back to regular order and begin to get appropriations bills passed in this house. Candidly, I don't want to lose that opportunity, and I think we still have it. Hope still reigns eternal, in my view, and I hope Senator Cotton will see that this is not worth taking down this bill, because I believe that would happen. I believe there are enough votes to deny cloture, and that is too bad. I don't want to see it because that means it is going to happen with other bills. It means that we are going to have what some term as poison pill amendments. The administration views this as a poison pill amendment. We know at Interior there are poison pill amendments. Both Senator Alexander and I have chaired that committee, and we know what happens. We are trying to set an example on this floor by working things out.  It would seem to me that a reasonable Senator might say: All right. I am not going to hold up this bill. I made my point. I realize what is happening. I know this heavy water is going to be put to good use in this country. I know that Iran has to limit its supply at 130 metric tons, so we know this heavy water is out of Iran. As a matter of fact, it is in a storehouse in Oman. It is on the market, and the United States has said we would buy it. That is the right thing to do to set an example so that nuclear proliferation does not take place, and this is part of that. It is my hope that we will be able to resolve that.  The Senator from Tennessee is imminently reasonable, and I like to believe that I am reasonable, I say to my colleague. I am hopeful that maybe before the hour of 5 p.m., we might be able to come to some agreement; otherwise, I think the cloture motion will be defeated.  I yield the floor.
