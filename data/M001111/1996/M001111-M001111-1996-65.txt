 President, the amendment before us strikes the provision in the bill that cuts the reimbursement rate on the Summer Food Program dramatically. The bill proposes to cut 23 cents from every school lunch provided in this critical summer program. This will have a dramatic effect, especially in our rural areas.  I think we have had the debate on this floor. Everyone understands the need to have good, strong nutrition for our children in order for them to learn. The Summer Food Program is especially critical. Children are not bears. They do not hibernate. They need to eat in the summer as much as they do in the school year.  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment and put back in effect the important Summer Food Program. I understand the majority is willing, perhaps, to accept this on a voice vote. If that is the case, I am more than happy to oblige.
