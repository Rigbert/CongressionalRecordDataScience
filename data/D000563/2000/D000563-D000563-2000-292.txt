What the Republicans are prepared to do is spend our surplus by providing tax breaks for the wealthy people in this country. The Senator and I happen to see it differently. We believe we can reform the estate tax and basically protect small businesses, family farms, and estates of people leaving $8 million, and still have money left for valid programs in this country. It will help a lot of working families and family farmers.
