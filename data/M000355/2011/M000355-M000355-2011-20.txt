 President, I stand today to honor an exemplary Kentuckian and patriot, Mr. Leo F. Weddle of Somerset, KY. Mr. Weddle is a veteran of the Korean war; he selflessly served our Nation as a machine-gunner during that conflict.  In 1950, just 3 years after graduating high school, Leo decided to enlist in the Marines, an idea he had already given considerable thought to. Leo was inspired one day by the obvious pride and glamour that was exhibited by a young marine in uniform whom Leo saw from the window of his Greyhound bus as Leo was traveling home to Somerset, KY, from his sister's house in Beaumont, TX. It was at that exact moment, somewhere in a small Arkansas town, that Leo decided to enlist to serve his country.  After his introduction into the Marine Corps, Leo spent the next several months enduring the rigors of boot camp in Parris Island, SC, and combat training at Camp Pendleton in Oceanside, CA. When combat training concluded, Leo and his unit boarded the troopship USS General William Weigel. Leo's unit eventually landed in Yokuska, Japan, after 2 weeks at sea.  On June 5, 1951, the day Leo arrived in Korea, he was immediately transported to the front line for combat, where he joined George Company, 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Division, later nicknamed ``Bloody George.'' Leo's unit was under heavy fire from the moment he arrived. ``They had just lost a machine gunner and were asking for a volunteer,'' he said. ``Fools really do rush in where angels fear to tread, and I volunteered for the position. I served as a machine gunner for the duration of my time in Korea.''  On September 21, 1951, Leo was wounded by a mortar that killed two officers and six enlisted men. Ironically, to Leo, the shell exploded closer to him than any other person, but the shrapnel propelled from it that hit him only left small pieces of metal in his legs and head. Those farther away were hit with larger pieces of metal that inflicted more severe, even fatal injuries. Six decades later, Leo still has fragments of the mortar in has legs and forehead.  Today at 77 years of age, Leo feels blessed to be able to look back on his wartime experiences as a veteran who has since lead a healthy and successful life. ``I recall vividly many images of the horrors of war,'' Leo says, ``but I also remember my fellow Marines, courageous young men with whom I shared the most intense life-and-death experiences most of us would ever face.''  Leo was so inspired by these experiences that he wrote a poem while he was still in Korea to help him share the love and appreciation for America he felt half a world away. Leo believes he may never have had the opportunity to truly express these feelings had he not had the opportunity to serve his country in battle as he did.  Mr. President, I would ask that my Senate colleagues join me in thanking Mr. Leo F. Weddle, a valiant Kentucky veteran, for his courage and selflessness in fighting to preserve our country's freedom. Mr. Weddle is an honorable man whose sacrifice and lifelong success serve as an inspiration to the people of our great Commonwealth. The Commonwealth Journal, a Somerset-area publication, recently published an article written by Mr. Weddle recounting his time as a U.S. marine. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           [From the Commonwealth Journal, November 11, 2011]                          A Veteran Remembers                           (By Leo F. Weddle)       In 1950, three years after my high-school graduation, the      Korean War was under way and I had given considerable thought      to joining the service. One beautiful autumn day I     was riding a Greyhound bus from my sister's home in Beaumont,      Texas, to my hometown of Somerset, KY.       Somewhere along the way, in a small town in Arkansas, I saw      from the window a young Marine, resplendent in his dress blue      uniform. The glamour of that uniform and the obvious pride of      the man wearing it captivated me. At that moment I decided to      volunteer for the Marines, and I did so as soon as I arrived      in Somerset.       After my introduction into the Marine Corps, I endured      weeks of stress and intimidation in boot camp at Parris      Island, South Carolina, followed by combat training at Camp      Pendleton in Oceanside, California. After completing my      training, my unit boarded a troopship, the USS General      William Weigel, and after two weeks at sea, we landed in      Yokuska, Japan.       On June 5, 1951, I arrived in Korea and became a member of      George Company, 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Division, later      nicknamed ``Bloody George.'' The day I arrived, I was      transported to the front line and immediately entered combat.      My unit was under heavy fire. They had just lost a machine      gunner and were asking for a volunteer. Fools really do rush      in where angels fear to tread, and I volunteered for the      position. I served as a machine gunner for the duration of my      time in Korea.       Minutes after I arrived on the line, a mortar shell hit a      few feet from me. Luckily, it turned out to be a dud. If it      had exploded, I would almost certainly have been killed on my      first day of battle. As it was, I was wounded by another      mortar a few months later, on September 21, 1951. We were on      Hill 751, which came to be known as ``Starvation Hill.''       For three days and three nights, the fighting was so      intense that our Korean supply carriers could only bring      ammunition. Food was a lower priority in this situation than      the much-needed ammo, so we had to make do with what we had      until the shelling diminished.       A friend of mine was hit, and I climbed out of my foxhole      to help him. While I was out of the foxhole, a mortar shell      came in. It killed two officers and wounded six enlisted men.      The irony of the situation was that the mortar landed closer      to me than to anyone else, but the explosion propelled      shrapnel that embedded only small pieces of metal in my legs      and head, while dispersing larger pieces to the men who were      killed or more seriously wounded.       The mind is a strange and wonderful thing. If I close my      eyes, even to this day, I can still see the dirt, debris and      shrapnel exploding as clearly as I could at the moment it      happened. Fifty-five years later, I still have small      fragments of that mortar in my legs and forehead. During the      months that I served in Korea, I saw great acts of courage by      my fellow Marines as they dealt with the brutality and mayhem      of war. I came to realize that heroism often involves      reacting to a situation in a way that seems to be most      expedient at a given moment.       I recall many images of the horrors of war, of course, but      I also remember my fellow Marines, courageous young men with      whom I shared the most intense life-and-death experiences      most of us would ever face.       While I was still in combat in Korea, I wrote the following      poem. My experiences there gave me a love and appreciation      for America that I might never have been able to express had      I not had the opportunity to serve my country in this way.       Today I am 77 years old and looking back on my own wartime      experiences from the vantage point of a healthy and      successful life. I hear the stories of today's young Marines      who are risking their bodies and lives for the same      principles that motivated me and my comrades in Korea so many      years ago. For any soldier or Marine who serves his country      in time of any war, I believe this poem expresses the love      and pride that he feels for his homeland, the United States.                           Mr. You and Mr. Me     What is America? I ask myself,     It is happiness, contentment, success and wealth,     With a touch of hardship, dirt and grime,     Mixed together with work and time,     Is Mr. You or Mr. Me?     America is a sweetheart, modest and dear,     It's high school and college, or a cheerleader's cheer.     It's a bright hello or a sad good-bye,     It's all these things and much more too,     That go into making the Red, White and Blue.     America is football, baseball and track,     Or just a little afternoon snack.     It's a drive in the country, a walk into town,     or just a policeman making his round.     It's a chocolate sundae or a picture show     That forms the pattern of this land we know.     It's Mom and Dad--Sister too,     And a little brother, or me and you.     It's Brooklyn and Jersey, the Dodgers and Phils,     Or a beautiful river with valleys and hills.     But it takes these things and the heavens above     To make our America, the land we love.     It's barefoot boys who skip school for fishing,     And pigtailed girls who tag along, wishing.     It's the old and the young, the brave and the true,     But mostly America is made up of you.     It's what you believe and what you can see     That count in this land of democracy.     The names of Washington, Lincoln and Jones,     The Tom Smiths, Dick Phillips, and Harry Malones     Are parts of America we see every day     As we walk along its crowded highway.     Yes, all of these things we daily see,     Until they are a part of you and me.     America is brown, yellow and white,     With a touch of red, it's quite a sight,     For we are a mixture from many lands     Who believe in liberty and freedom's stands,     And we back up this faith with blood and tears     Shed by patriots throughout the years.     It's soldiers, sailors, pilots, Marines,     Who make up our nation's fighting machines.     It's ``blood and guts'' when the time demands,     For freedom's cause we take our stands.     It's all America, just one big show,     Of the things we do and the things we know.     It's our faith in God to do His will,     Our belief that we have His protection still,     That makes America strong and free,     It's a wonderful place for you and me.     And though many places our feet may roam,     May they safely return us to our home,     America.                               ____________________
