President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, not introduced, but printed in the Record, a copy of a joint resolution which is very close to one that will be introduced by this side as an amendment during this debate.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, a follows:                              S.J. Res. --       Whereas the independent counsel law was created to restore      public confidence in the criminal justice system after the      abuses of the Watergate scandal;       Whereas the decision on whether to invoke the independent      counsel process in a particular matter rests by      constitutional necessity with the Attorney General and not      with the United States Congress;       Whereas the law provides, in section 591(a) of title 28,      United States Code, that the Attorney General must invoke the      independent counsel process where there is specific      information from a credible source that a crime may have been      committed by a covered person;       Whereas the law provides, in section 591(c)(1) of title 28,      United States Code, that the Attorney General may invoke the      independent counsel process where there is specific      information from a credible source that a crime may have been      committed by any other person and where the Justice      Department has a personal, financial, or political conflict      of interest;       Whereas the law provides, in section 591(c)(2) of title 28,      United States Code, that the Attorney General may invoke the      independent counsel process where there is specific      information from a credible source that a crime may have been      committed by a Member of Congress and where it would be in      the public interest to do so;       Whereas the Attorney General has invoked the independent      counsel law in the past, and has stated that she will invoke      the law again if and when the legal standards have been met      in a particular matter;       Whereas the independent counsel law was never intended to      be used in a partisan manner, and such a misuse of the law      would damage public confidence in the criminal justice      system; and       Whereas it would be unprecedented and inappropriate for the      Congress to cast a vote which would have the appearance of      attempting to politically influence a decision by the      Attorney General on whether to invoke the independent counsel      process in a particular manner: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the      United States of America in Congress assembled, That it is      the sense of the Congress that the Attorney General should      exercise her best professional judgment, without regard to      political pressures and in accordance with the standards of      the law and the established policies of the Department of      Justice, to determine whether the independent counsel process      should be invoked, pursuant to section 591(a) or (c), to      investigate allegations of criminal misconduct by any      government official, Member of Congress, or other person in      connection with any presidential or congressional election      campaign.
