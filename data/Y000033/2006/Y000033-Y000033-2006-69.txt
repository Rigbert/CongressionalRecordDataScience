Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I want to thank the Texas delegation for working together to bring forth this bill and solving a problem. My job is to solve problems, and this bill does solve a problem. It takes two cities and puts them together, and allows the State to go forward and we won't have this problem before us anymore.  A lot of times we lose sight of solving problems in this body by hanging up on jurisdiction or hanging up on a small clause. But we are the people that write the laws, we create the laws, and we try to make them work.  This is a bill that will take and rectify a mistake, I believe, in the past, and bring both parties together, both cities together, all airlines together, and provide for the service of the people of Texas and this Nation. I urge the passage of this bill.
