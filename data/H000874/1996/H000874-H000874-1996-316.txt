Speaker, I want to say to the public, notwithstanding the philosophical differences, the gentleman who chairs the Committee on Rules, the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon], and I are good friends, and we work closely together on a number of issues. I respect him, and believe he respects me.  The gentleman raises a number of interesting points. First of all, I do not believe I said this was a bad rule. I said the timing of this rule was historic, and the reason being because we apparently are going to go home, Mr. Speaker. Let me further say that, very frankly, the reason you need this rule is not because there could not be a unanimous consent resolution on our side which says we will keep Government working past the 26th at the levels currently in force, by unanimous consent. You would not need a rule for that.  Mr. McINNIS. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker.                             point of order
