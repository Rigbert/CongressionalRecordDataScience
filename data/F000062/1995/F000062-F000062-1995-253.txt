 Dutch peacekeepers present in Srebrenica have reported witnessing summary executions of Bosnian soldiers. The U.N. human rights envoy told reporters that ``what happened (in Srebrenica) cannot be described as moderate violations of human rights, but as extremely serious violations on an enormous scale.''  Yesterday, the Bosnian Foreign Minister called me from Zagreb. He told me that as many as 10,000 people are still missing from Srebrenica, and that of the 6,000 Bosnian men and boys held hostage in a stadium in Bratunac, north of Srebrenica, as many as 1,600 have been executed.  Most startlingly, he indicated that last Monday, the Bosnian President offered to peacefully evacuate Zepa. This offer was turned down by General Mladic. I believe we know the reason.  If the evacuation had taken place peacefully and under U.N. supervision, it would have deprived the Serbs of the opportunity to detain and kill all the men of fighting age, and the opportunity to rape, torture, and humiliate defenseless refugees.  To me, it is unfathomable that crimes like these can be perpetrated in 1995, 50 years after the liberation of Auschwitz. The names Karadzic and Mladic will go down in history with the greatest villains of our time. They have led a regime that sanctions, promotes, and encourages its soldiers to murder, torture, rape, and humiliate innocent Bosnian civilians. They are evil.  Today, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia announced indictments of both Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic for war crimes. It is my hope that both these men, and numerous other war criminals, will be successfully prosecuted.  I know that every Member of the Senate is outraged by the barbaric behavior that has taken place. But for the Bosnian victims of these crimes, our outrage is worth little, unless it leads to action. In the face of these atrocities, we must make an important decision.  Our choices are clear: we must either dramatically change the U.N. operation on the ground in such a way that it will be able to protect Bosnian citizens from Bosnian Serb murderers and rapists; or, we must lift the arms embargo against the Bosnian Government, unilaterally if necessary, in order to allow the Bosnians to defend themselves.  But there is one thing we cannot do, and that is nothing.  Last week, Secretary of Defense Perry, Secretary of State Christopher, and General Shalikashvili met in London with our NATO allies. They were attempting to devise a response to the collapse of Srebrenica and Zepa that will prevent and punish further Bosnian Serb attacks on safe areas and defend the civilians in those areas.  Before these meetings began, I felt that in order to be successful, they would have to succeed in radically changing the mission and mandate of the allied troops on the ground in Bosnia, giving them the wherewithal and command structure to fight effectively that they have lacked thus far.  Unfortunately, I do not feel that the agreements reached in London meet that test. I have spoken with the Secretary of State. I have spoken with our Ambassadors in London and Paris. And I have spoken at length with the Foreign Minister of Bosnia. All of these conversations have solidified my view that there has not been a sufficient change in the situation on the ground.  The London meetings only addressed the enclave of Gorazde. It is true that a fairly resolute statement was issued regarding a Serb offensive on Gorazde. Substantial allied airstrikes will be ordered in response to any attack on Gorazde.  What constitutes a Serb assault on Gorazde? Is this present shelling that has been going on since the London Conference enough to provoke action? Does a siege that cuts off the flow of humanitarian aid warrant airstrikes? Gorazde has in fact been shelled continuously since the London conference. Why have the airstrikes not begun?  Unfortunately, the promised defense of Gorazde only means that the Serbs will continue their attacks at Zepa, which I understand has finally fallen, Bihac, then Sarajevo, and Tuzla, and then what? In fact, the fate of Bosnia is sealed if the enclaves fall--for only 30 percent of Bosnia remains in government hands today.  As we debate this resolution, Bihac is surrounded and under attack. In this offensive, the Bosnian Serbs are receiving assistance from their Croatian Serb brethren--25,000 Croatian Serbs are coming over the border to augment the attacking forces. Bihac has received no food convoys for two months, and relief flights have been suspended because of the shelling. There is virtually no food left in Bihac, and residents are able to eat only what they can grow.  As for Sarajevo, it is perhaps the most important of all the enclaves. Its fall would mean the end of Bosnia. Yet, Sarajevo was hardly mentioned in London. It is true that since the conference, British and French troops from the Rapid Reaction Force have deployed around Sarajevo to respond to Serb shelling. But their mission, it seems, is primarily to protect U.N. forces. Earlier, in our caucus, the Secretary of State indicated that these troops would respond to Serb attacks on the civilian population. I certainly hope so.  As the Bosnian Foreign Minister told me, drawing a line in the sand around Gorazde alone is like drawing a line in the sand around one solitary sunbather on a beach. It may protect that one sunbather, but it ignores everything else on the beach.  Third, it is not at all clear that the United States and our allies have the same understanding about the agreements reached in London. While British Foreign Secretary Rifkind, promised a ``substantial and decisive'' response to any Serb attack on Gorazde, only U.S. officials mentioned the certainty of airstrikes.  Furthermore, it is entirely clear that Russia does not support a policy based on the use of airstrikes to contain the Bosnian Serbs. Foreign Minister Kozyrev went out of his way to say that ``no consensus'' had been reached in London. How Russia would respond to a policy that it does not support is uncertain. This uncertainty may well prove dangerous.  I had hoped that the London meetings would have initiated a genuine change to the situation on the ground in Bosnia. I wanted to be convinced. But with the weight of all the evidence, I am afraid the London conference appears inconclusive, and that the status quo will continue.  The London meetings do not produce a new course of action, and did not commit the allies to protect the Bosnians. I am convinced that we have no choice but to lift the arms embargo against the Bosnians. I prefer that it be a multilateral lifting. It has become painfully clear now that no one will defend the Bosnians except the Bosnians themselves. If no one will defend them, we can no longer deny them the right to defend themselves. And so, I intend to support the Dole-Lieberman resolution.  Last year, I opposed a similar resolution, in large part because it contained a policy of ``lift and leave''. It would have forced the President to lift the arms embargo unilaterally before any effort had been taken to extract UNPROFOR from Bosnia. I felt that was unfair to our allies, who have troops on the ground there.  The resolution before us has gone a long way toward addressing those concerns. It now contains a ``leave and lift'' sequence, which is very important. The President would not be required to lift the arms embargo until 12 weeks after UNPROFOR began its withdrawal, and that period could be extended in 30 day increments if the withdrawal took longer than expected. I believe that this change alters the effect of the resolution considerably.  This is a time for the entire world to feel outraged at the atrocities now being carried out with merciless abandon. And where is the conscience of the world? In fact, much of the world genuinely wants to help. Today, for example, a joint delegation from Israel and Jordan are meeting in Bosnia to see what they can do to help.  Let there be no mistake--we are watching the development of a ``Fourth Reich'' dedicated to the genocide of a people simply because they are different. To me, after the events of the past 3 years, there is little difference--except in size--between the drive for a pure Aryan nation 50 years ago, and that for an ethnically cleansed Greater Serbia of today.  The Bosnian Foreign Minister put it to me so eloquently yesterday when he said:       No one has taken on the job of defending the Bosnian      people. UNPROFOR is not a substitute for our defense, and the      Rapid Reaction Force is committed only to defend UNPROFOR. We      must know that somebody is going to defend us--and that      somebody is only us.  An afflicted people must have the right to defend themselves. This resolution signals no more and no less.                               Exhibit 1    United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) Preliminary                  Protection Report No. 1 July 18, 1995       The following is a report based on initial interviews      conducted with displaced people who fled Srabrenica after it      was overrun by Serb forces.                             i. chronology of events       11 July--Serb forces overran Srabrenica after days of      intense artillery and mortar shelling. Residents and      displaced people flee burning houses and head for the Dutch      UNPROFOR Battalion in Potocari, about 10 km north of      Srabrenica. Others escape toward Sagna Finger on foot heading      for Tuzia. Serb forces enter Potocari in the afternoon and      disarm Dutch troops.       12 July--Serb forces began moving by bus people who had      escaped to Potocari to Klandanj, about 70 km away. From      there, the displaced were forced to move across 6 km of no      man's land. They were met across the other side by Bosnian      trucks and transported to the Tuzla Air Base. As the number      of people swells, UNPROFOR opens a camp settlement inside the      base.       13 July--Thursday Bosnian government agrees to move      displaced people massed outside the air base to collective      centers.       14 July--Government says the first elements of a column of      15,000 Bosnian soldiers, some of them accompanied by their      families arrive in the village of Medjedja after walking      across the forested Sapna finger. Four days later, the number      of people had reached 8,000. The arrivals were wearing rags      and mostly barefooted after their shoes were torn apart      during the march. The government says it expects more      soldiers and civilians to arrive in Madjedja and requested      UNHCR for food and non-food items.       18 July--ICRC evacuates to Tuzla 87 wounded from a hospital      in Bratunac and the Dutch medical facility at Potocari.                       ii. summary of narratives       2.1 Random interviews were conducted among arrivals at the      tent camp at the Tuzlaa airbase. At the outset, it must be      explained that none of the accounts could be independently      confirmed. The accounts include incidents of rape, robbery      and execution stories were told of families being separated      of men and women being taken away by Serb soldiers. Soldiers      who escaped across the Sapna finger say the encountered heavy      shelling, mine fields, ambushes and massacres along the way      to Sapna in which hundreds were either killed or captured.                            iii. interviews       1. From Potocari to Kladanj.       1.1 As civilians, mostly women and children, were fleeing      advancing Serb forces, shells fell everywhere along the road      to Potocari. One woman claims she saw scores of people killed      and wounded in the mortar and artillery barrages. Upon      reaching Potocari, the civilians gathered in and around the      Dutch battalion camp and in the surrounding abandoned      factories. Serb soldiers walked inside the camp and started      separating families. Men of fighting age and young women were      taken away, according to uniform accounts of the people      interviewed.       1.2 One woman says her husband was stabbed dead before her      eyes. She was dragged away to a bus but she managed to go      back to look for her husband. Later, she found his body at      the garage of a factory. Seven other bodies were lying there.      Other women say that as they were waiting to be boarded in      buses to Kladanj their husbands were taken away and that they      did not know what happened to them.       1.3 Two women interviewed say men were separated from women      as people were being loaded in the buses. They claim that      Serb soldiers demanded money from them, but gave nothing      since they didn't have any. One woman was separated together      with the men because she is a relative of a senior Bosnian      army officer.       1.4 The buses were stopped a number of times along the road      to Klandanj. Men who were allowed to leave after the first      screening were picked out of the buses and taken away. They      include boys aged 12 years and upward and young women.       1.5 A 60-year-old man and his wife say that in their bus,      four young women were taken out into the woods. An hour      later, only three of the women returned to the bus. The      fourth woman showed up in Kladanj naked with only a blanket      wrapped around her.       1.6 Not only were incidents of robbery narrated before the      people were put on the buses, but also as the convoys moved      toward Klandanj. Along the route, Serb soldiers would demand      the meager belongings and money from the passengers. One Serb      soldier slashed the upper lip of a woman who could not      produce money. Robbery also was allegedly committed as the      people were offloaded at Kladanj.       1.7 One man says he counted 11 bodies as he walked toward      Bosnian-controlled area along a six-kilometer stretch of no      man's land. He says they apparently were victims of robbery      attempts by Serb forces operating across the no-man's land.       1.8 Dead Bosnian men in civilian and military clothes were      seen scattered along the route to Kladanj. Groups of hundreds      of captured Bosnian soldiers, their hands behind the back of      their head were all along the route.       2. Escape to Sapna Finger.       2.1 Four soldiers interviewed say they were among a column      of 15,000 people, including 6,000 women and children, who      broke across Serb-controlled areas after Srebrenica fell.      They walked through 70 km of forests and faced heavy      shelling, land mines and ambushes. Hundreds were reportedly      killed and hundreds more were captured.       2.2 One soldier said the first ambush took place in      Jaglici, the day the column left Srebrenica. He says more      than 60 people were killed. At Konjevic Polja, the column      encountered Serb soldiers in UNPROFOR uniform and using UN      vehicles. One Serb soldier with a loudhailer called on the      Bosnians to come out. Between 20 to 30 Bosnians, mostly      children and women, who emerged out of hiding were lined up      on the road. Then the Serbs opened fire with machine guns,      killing all of them. The same soldier says he saw about 50      Bosnian bodies beside a road toward Cereka. And in another      place later on, soldiers stepped on mine fields and that 150      were reportedly killed there. At Udrio, 300 to 400 were      allegedly killed in an ambush. Another 300 to 600 were      reportedly captured. Three other soldiers gave similar      stories.       3. MEDEVAC.       3.1 Interviews were conducted with four male and five      female civilians who were evacuated by car from Srebrenica--     the Dutch facility at Potacari and the hospital in Bratunac--     by ICRC. They were among 87 brought to Tuzla at the Norwegian      medical center. The males were mostly soldiers who were      wounded during the fighting before the fall of Srebrenica and      were confined at the hospital there. After the Serbs took      control of the town, the patients said they were mistreated.      Serb soldiers and civilians entered their rooms a number of      times and kicked and beat them up. One 60-year-old man says      he was hit by a rifle butt in the chest.
