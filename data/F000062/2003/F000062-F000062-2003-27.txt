 President, I thank the Democratic whip for his concern and his words.  I want to correct a couple of things. The Senator from Missouri pointed out that catalytic converters are fire hazards. That may be true with some. But virtually every automobile, every pickup truck, every sport utility vehicle driving on the roads and highways of California today is equipped with a catalytic converter. It has been that way for a substantial period of time. Catalytic converters are nothing new.  Secondly, I want you to know that Honda has said that they would increase their U.S. production of these engines even with the California regulation. So, in other words, there are other companies manufacturing these engines in the United States that have said they would adhere to these new regulations and produce cleaner engines.  Thirdly, I want you to know that Briggs & Stratton has already moved some of its operations to China. I very much doubt that this California regulation has much to do with it. I am told they have been manufacturing in China since 1986, and in April of this year they increased their ownership share of two factories in China from 52 percent to a controlling 90 percent. I am also told that California regulators have incorporated Briggs & Stratton's own recommendations into its final rule issued in September. The Air Resources Board relaxed the regulation's exhaust emissions standard, relying instead on controlling evaporative emissions, as recommended by Briggs & Stratton.  So I don't know why this is being done. But I will tell you one thing: everybody who votes to sustain this will be also voting to put 70 more tons of smog into California's skies in 2010. That is how important this issue is to our State.  I yield the floor.
