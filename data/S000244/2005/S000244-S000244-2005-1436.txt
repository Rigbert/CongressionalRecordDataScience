 Section 4 of the bill gives Federal courts jurisdiction over class action lawsuits in which the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $5 million, excluding interests and costs and at least one proposed class member and one defendant are citizens of different States or countries.  For purposes of the citizenship element of this analysis, S. 5 does not alter current law. Thus, a corporation will continue to be deemed a citizen of any State by which it has been incorporated and of the State where it has its principal place of business. However, the bill provides that for purposes of this new section, and section 1453 of title 28, an unincorporated association shall be deemed to be a citizen of the State where it has its principal place of business and the State under whose laws it organized. This provision is added to ensure that unincorporated associations receive the same treatment as corporations for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. New subsection 1332(d)(10) corrects this anomaly.
