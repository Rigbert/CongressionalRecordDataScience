The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 was a watershed in efforts to make life safer and more dignified for individuals living in long-term care institutions.  Since 1987, the long-term care industry has continued to evolve in ways that require another look at the state of long-term care. In a constantly changing for-profit and nonprofit industry, Federal and State governments need better information about the organizations and staff who provide care to residents of long-term care. Individuals, families, and service providers also need good information about long-term care to make informed decisions about their options.  Chairman Kohl, I laud you and your colleagues who have thoughtfully identified current or emerging problems in long-term care. The Nursing Home Transparency and Improvement Act of 2008, S. 2641, makes important strides in helping us to get more substantive information about nursing home ownership and staffing. It strengthens the Nursing Home Compare Web site and provides additional information for the general public. I am therefore pleased to become a cosponsor of this legislation.
