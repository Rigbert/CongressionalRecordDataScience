 More than just thank him, I thank him for his brilliance and for his willingness to be part of this effort. I think Senator Levin is really one of the fine minds in this Senate. It has been a great delight for me to have the opportunity to work with him. I think he has helped us make this a much better bill. I thank him so much.  Mr. President, at this point I would like to read into the Record a colloquy between the two leaders, Senators Frist and Daschle, which makes clear the parameters of this and why we are on the floor on this bill. If I may:       Senator Daschle: Mr. President, Senator Feinstein has a      market manipulation amendment that she was seeking a vote on.      It is my understanding that the agricultural appropriations      bill would be the appropriate bill for that amendment. I      would inquire of the majority leader, should she offer her      amendment to that bill, would she be assured of a vote on or      in relation to her amendment with no second-degree      amendments, prior to such vote?  The majority leader responds:       The Democratic leader is correct. If Senator Feinstein      offers her amendment to that bill, she will get a vote on or      in relation to it.  I just offer that to clarify the present legal situation.
