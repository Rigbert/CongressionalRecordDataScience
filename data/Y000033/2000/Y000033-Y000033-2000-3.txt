Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Gekas) will continue with this dialogue, one of the things that a lot of people in America do not realize is that the reason we have the prosperity we have today is because we have had cheap energy.  Some people think that is wrong, that we ought to take and conserve all the energy. But if we want to grow, we have a supply and an abundance of energy so we can have the high-tech and the computer industry, by the way, which now uses 27 percent of our electrical power which did not happen 15 years ago. Twenty-seven percent of our electrical power today is consumed by computers.  For those that are in the computer world, think about it: when power goes down, their computer goes off. That means the airplanes do not fly. That means the stoplights do not work. That means this country comes to a halt.  And so what the gentleman has said, let us get a policy so that the future generations, yes, and the present generations in reality will have a constant supply of reasonably priced energy.  But if the gentleman would like for one moment to address something for me, he mentioned that if we do this the OPEC countries may drop their price. I happen to agree.  What would the gentleman think we should do, though, maybe what the commission can do, to solve that problem.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Gekas).
