 Madam President, I am amazed on this issue. I look at the schedule set by the distinguished Speaker of the House, and we have so very few legislative days remaining that now we have this as a top priority--a bill to strip zoning and land use decisions from small towns and cities and counties--instead of passing important funding bills.  I do know the law requires us to have a budget by April 15; it also requires us to file our taxes bill April 15--we demand every person in the country do that. But it seems that the majority of the Republican leadership did not findit in their heart to obey their own law to pass the budget by that time.  I am not sure we have passed the budget. We passed one in the Senate; the House, months later, passed one; I don't believe it has been conferenced.  Anyway, these are things we cannot seem to find time to do, that the law requires us to do. The law requires us to file our income tax returns. The law requires the House and Senate to pass a budget by April 15. But the other body, at least, never got around to doing that.  We weren't able to find time to pass a tobacco bill, so there is not one that might be different from exactly what the tobacco companies want. We certainly haven't found time to pass legislation to increase patients' rights. We found it impossible to find time to pass legislation on campaign financing. But now we seem to be looking for the time to consider a bill that will take power away from State and local government. That power that we take from State and local government will go to the Federal courts.  This is the same U.S. Senate, Madam President, which has found it difficult to perform its constitutional duty to fill the scores of vacancies in the same Federal courts. On the one hand, we are saying we will not fill the vacancies; we will leave 75 to 100 vacancies in the Federal court. The U.S. Senate can't find time to confirm the people who are pending, like Sonia Sotomayor and others. But we have time to say we don't care what the States think in their courts. We don't care what counties and municipalities think in their courts. We will take their power away from them and dump them in the Federal court. Now, we are not going to have enough judges in the Federal court to handle the cases, because we will give the Federal courts a whole lot of jurisdiction they never asked for and don't want, in an unprecedented--unprecedented--exercise in antifederalism and unprecedented exercise of the Federal Government reaching into the States and stripping away their power and dumping into a Federal court. That is what we are spending our time on.  Maybe I made a mistake in reading some of the rhetoric that went with the Contract on America that my good friends on the other side of the aisle proposed which talked about giving power back to the States, back to the communities. They said: We have to get the Federal Government off your back. And yet now we have a piece of legislation which says: Whoops, we are going to take all your power away from you and give it to the Federal courts. Well, well, well.  This is a bill that would federalize local zoning decisions. This is a bill which goes against everything that the Republican Party has said they stood for, certainly everything that the people in my State, Republicans and Democrats, stand for, and that is giving power to local people. This goes against it. Why? Because its unabashed purpose is to give wealthy developers increased power to short-circuit communities' decisions, those decisions made through the public processes of local government.  Basically, what this is, it is a bill to instill the golden rule, saying, if you have got the gold, you are going to make the rules. That is basically what it is. If you have got plenty of money, don't worry about pesky little things like a State court or zoning court or the things a community has a stake in; ignore those, because you can make your decision from your corporate headquarters 2,000 miles away, and you could care less what the people of Bar Harbor, ME, or Burlington, VT, might think because you have got the money and you have got the bill.  S. 2271, the so-called Private Property Rights Implementation Act, will give developers greater access to Federal courts and less accountability to local governments than any other citizens have. In fact, this legislation elevates the rights of property owners above other constitutional rights, such as civil rights. It goes back almost to a time when we were forming this country where they said: If you have a lot of property, you should be the only ones with rights; you should have the votes; you should make the laws if you have a lot of property and a lot of money. And we said, no, no, no, no, we had a little matter of fighting the Revolution so that wouldn't happen. We call it democracy--not anarchy, not monarchy, but democracy.  I have received letters from Governors, State attorneys general, and county commissioners opposing this assault on local decisionmaking.  In fact, the National Association of Counties passed a resolution opposing this effort, stating that these types of decisions are best made at the local level with ample opportunity for all parties to seek nonjudicial solutions.  Then the National Conference of State Legislatures recently said, ``The only certain result would be an additional centralization of power in an unelected Federal judiciary at the expense of the States.''  The National League of Cities and the U.S. Conference of Mayors are also concerned that this effort would lead to significant property tax increases. Mayor Giuliani, Republican mayor of New York, is worried about the unfunded mandates in the bill. He said, ``It remains to be seen where the resources will come from to pay for these added burdens . . . on local governments that would have to defend themselves in these proceedings.''  The Justice Department advises us that this effort will interfere with local governments' ability to have a say in how close garbage dumps, liquor stores, adult bookstores and noisy industrial plants can be to schools, homes, and churches. What it says is, if your town doesn't want a porno shop next to your church or your school, the developer could say, ``We are going to put it there, and you don't even have a say in it anymore. We are going into Federal court.''  The National Association of Towns and Townships, representing 11,000 local governments and many tens of thousands of local elected officials--Republicans and Democrats alike--stresses that the bill ``would involve Federal courts in those disputes well before local governments and landowners have had the opportunity to fully consider the range of development alternatives . . . . Clearly, communities want to keep factories away from residential areas and adult stores away from schools.'' I hope so. I hope the U.S. Senate would not pass a bill to make it easier for porno shops to go next to grade schools or churches.  Mayor Giuliani calls these measures a fundamental intrusion upon his city's authority over local land use decisions, and he has written to me opposing this bill in the strongest terms. A recent Washington Post article described his efforts to eradicate strip clubs, X-rated video stores, and peep shows in the Times Square area. Make no mistake about it. If you vote for this bill, you are voting for a bill that would be a roadblock to those efforts.  The contradictions presented by this bill are startling. Instead of trusting local mayors, councils, planning and zoning commissioners, and Governors to know what is best for its citizens, this bill short-circuits the local process and it turns local land use disputes into Federal cases. I point out that the mayor of New York City is better equipped to handle the legal expenses this bill would impose than are countless small towns I could mention in Vermont or other States, including my own small town of Middlesex, VT. But even New York City--with many, many times the population and wealth of my State of Vermont--says the burden this bill would impose would be onerous.  Can you imagine--whether it is a town of 500, or 1,000, or 2,000--the little town of Strafford, VT, which I had the privilege to visit on the Fourth of July, has just a few hundred people. One of them was Senator Morrill, a former Senator--Senator Morrill of the 19th century, one of the longest serving Senators from Vermont--that was his homestead and his home--who came out of that little town having some sense of education and the need for education in small States and small towns, began the Land Grant Act. Look what we have benefited by that--every State in this Union. But that little town would be totally wiped out if somebody wanted to come in and destroy their whole character and say, ``You can't do anything to stop us.''  The mayors have told me the chilling effect the bill would have on their entire planning process by the specter of paying takings damages and attorney fees to developers, merely because a Federal judge sitting in a court somewhere distant disagrees with the wisdom of a particular use policy thatwould result in a wholesale retreat for local zoning decisions.  As Mayor Larry Curtis of Ames, IA, testified before the Judiciary Committee, ``You only have to look at budgets of our small towns to see how S. 2271 would be tipping the scales of justice in favor of wealthy developers.''  The top four developers in the United States have annual revenues in excess of $1 billion per year. Just four developers represent over $1 billion a year in revenues. Most of our small towns generate less than $10 million a year, and some way less than $10 million a year, in tax revenues. Ninety-percent of cities and towns in America have less than 10,000 people. They couldn't hire a lawyer to fight a well-entrenched developer. Of course not.  In my State, with a median community of around 2,500 people--my own community of Middlesex, VT, has 1,500 people--you can see these towns need their revenues to pay for police officers, teachers, safer streets and schools, and not spend the time in Federal court fighting huge developers. How can we expect small towns to protect the rights of their residents against a $1 billion developer who can hire all the lawyers they want? I would rather be paying that money for teachers, or nurses, or police officers, and for the protection of our communities. But, unfortunately, the House of Representatives has already made the decision that we will take power away from the States, we will take power away from our communities, we will give that power to major developers, who may be, coincidentally, major contributors to political action committees. They will take the power away from our towns and our cities.  How that flies in the face of the rhetoric when they talk about giving power back to our communities. But it is now the responsibility of the Senate to step through with some common sense to safeguard the jurisdiction of the budgets of our towns from a barrage of lawsuits, from special interests, and allow them to focus on community needs.  By giving land speculators and developers this huge new club to wield in their dealings with local officials, this bill would also remove the public from what should be a democratic process to decide what goes on in our communities' backyards. In Vermont, we have been fighting our own backyard battles over the last year--battles against the towers on the hillsides of our Green Mountains. One of our primary tools to protect Vermont from being turned into some kind of a giant pincushion with 200-foot towers indiscriminately sprouting up on every mountain and valley, within the protections of our own State law, Act 250 has become basically the anti-pincushion law. It has resolved over 15,000 cases, and it has been done with local people and with our own sense of our State and our own people making the decision, not some out-of-State fat-cat corporation. And the resolutions of these cases have been instrumental in retaining the character and natural resources and the heritage of my native State of Vermont--the heritage that makes it unique.  S. 2271 would have allowed developers to drag each and every one of those 15,000 cases into Federal court instead of allowing the people of Vermont to make the decisions. It might have been people from a huge corporation in Houston, or California, or somewhere else, against the people of Vermont. As the former State's attorney in Vermont, I cannot imagine having to fight this many legal battles on an annual State budget of less than $10 million, which is for fighting all of the State's legal battles.  This legislation will allow developers to avoid local and State authority to drag local communities into Federal court, where they won't even have the resources and where they might as well give up and say:       Here are our choices. We could protect the people of our      community, we could protect the people of our State, we could      protect our heritage, we could do what the people of the      State want us to do, but in even trying to do it, we face the      risk of bankrupting the town or the State. So we want to      protect your heritage. We want to protect the reasons you      live here, but we can't bankrupt you, and we are just going      to have to surrender.  Why have we lost all the power in our local communities? Why have we lost the power of our States to stand up for the interests of our people, and the power of our communities to stand up for the interests of their people? Because the people in Washington, DC, in the House and Senate, were more interested in the needs and whims of a few fat-cat developers. They sold away our rights and our interests. They sold away our heritage. They sold away what makes our communities what they are.  Now, Madam President, I have spoken many times on the floor of the Senate on how I feel about my own State of Vermont. I have heard the Presiding Officer speak of the pride in her own State of Maine, one of the most beautiful States in this country. Each of our States is different. I kind of like it that way. But when we go home as Senators, every one of us has to feel the tug of our State and the feel of being there.  When I left my farmhouse in Middlesex, VT, this morning, I drove down the dirt road. Mist was coming out of the fields, a deer had just run across one of the fields, and the sun was shining. The sun rose on Mt. Ellen. I drove down along the Winooski River heading to the airport. It was so beautiful. A farmer was out tilling the field. I saw a hawk flying over one of the fields. My wife pointed to a place she likes the most as we drove along. It is a little spot, a tiny pond alongside the road, in an area that has been kept open for agriculture and recreation. The people in the community decided not to develop it, even though it would be prime development land. She said, ``Let's see if it is there.'' And it was. There is almost always a great blue heron standing in there. We can almost count on it in the morning as we head to the airport and drive up French Hill and come over the top and see the Champlain Valley and Burlington, and our really nice lake, Lake Champlain is out there. And I thought: How beautiful this is.  There are parts of the State I remember from when I was a child, and that is part of it. My father used to tell me that most of the mountains were open land and fields throughout at different times of our history. Now most of them are forests. Some of the areas had been farmland and are now developed. But it was done carefully, in the way we wanted it to be done in Vermont. Our Act 250 was put through the legislature by a conservative Republican Governor, Dean Davis. But, like me, he was a native Vermonter who wanted to keep the best of our State.  Has it worked perfectly in every case? Probably not. I am sure we could look back where something might have been done slightly differently, but for the vast majority of cases it has worked so well, and Vermont is a better place to live and a more beautiful State as a result. But we made our choices.  Now some out-of-State, wealthy developer might say to us, ``But if you had only let us come in here, if you had knocked out that pond where that great blue heron is--who knows, maybe one in a hundred cars go by--we could have put a building there, and you would have had tax revenues from it. You may even have had some jobs.''  You know, they are probably right. It probably might have even increased the per-capita income of our State. But do you know what, Madam President? The people of Vermont said that the beauty of that area is more valuable to us. And shouldn't we make that decision?  Now, every year, we have some developer from out of State who will come in and look at these magnificent views--views that we have preserved, sometimes at great sacrifices, as Vermonters, we have preserved. They come in and say, ``Oh, if we can just develop here, we will make millions for you and we will make even more millions for us. Someday you are going to be gone anyway, so what difference does it make?'' We say, ``No; we kind of like it this way.''  I think of the home that I have in Vermont. My parents bought it 41 years ago this summer. They bought it as a summer place. We have turned it into a year-round home. There is a field on it. This field has one of the prettiest views in central Vermont. It looks at Camel's Hump and at Mt. Ellen, and it is gorgeous.  About 3 weeks after my father bought the whole place, with a couple hundred acres, back in the late fifties, a man called him up and said, ``I would like to buy that field. I understand there is about 8 or 10 acres there out ofthe 200 that you bought.'' Dad said, ``That's right.'' He said, ``I will offer you for that field what you paid for the whole farm.'' My father said he wasn't interested. The man kept calling back every week, and the amount went up and up and up. He finally offered my father many, many times what he paid for the whole 200 acres for that 8 to 10 acres. And dad said, ``I won't sell.'' He said, I guess to impress my father--and my mother and father had a small printing business in Montpelier--he said, ``I will come up there in my private plane, and I will offer you enough money that you will sell.'' And dad said, ``I would hate to have you waste the time. I am not going to sell.'' He said, ``Well, why won't you?'' And my father made a comment that was actually prophetic because my wife and I do the same thing today. He said, ``Every so often we like walking up that field around sunset time and we like looking out there and seeing the Sun set.'' And he said to my dad, ``If that's all you want, sell it to me and you can come there and watch the Sun set anytime you want.'' My father said, ``No. It wouldn't be the same.''  Now, we take that attitude about many things in Vermont, Madam President. Somebody will say, ``Well, if we put up this huge tower or this bowl, it would improve your ability to get Baywatch'' or whatever else the 12 channels on which 12 different folks will tell you if you send contributions to them, they have a direct line to God and will get you a blessing, or a blessing bigger than money. And we say, ``No, we kind of like it the way it is.''  But we make that decision. And then an out-of-State telecommunications company can't come in and say, ``Oh, we are going to set you aside and we will go in there,'' because they are trying to do that under the Telecommunications Act now. Or somebody says, ``If we put this factory outlet right here, you know, if people come to see this great view here and they see the factory outlet, they will go down there.'' And we say, ``No, we kind of like the view the way it is.''  Just as years ago Vermont became the first State to ban billboards along its highways. Everybody said, ``Oh, my God. Your tourism will disappear; your businesses will disappear. You will become an economic wasteland.'' You know what happened. Tourism skyrocketed up because people kind of liked seeing the views and not seeing the billboards. But we made that decision. Under this law, the billboard company could come in and say, ``You can't make that decision because we are just going to come through and we are going to take over.''  Now, I know there are examples of citizens who want to develop their land and should have been allowed to develop it without pushing cases through the courts for years, but the U.S. Supreme Court has decided some recent cases in favor of landowners saying you have to make your decision. You can't tie it up forever. You do have to make your decision.  And that is fine. That is the way case law develops, and we make our decisions accordingly. But it does not justify rewriting Federal law to encourage developers to sue local governments for local zoning decisions. It does not justify a bill that will allow the filing of thousands of suits to prevent local governments from zoning out gas stations or incinerators or a 20-story building next to your house.  We need only to look at the list of actual takings claims that confront local governments to see what is wrong with this bill. In Tampa, FL, and Mobile, AL, officials were sued when they tried to restrict topless dancing bars. A chemical company challenged a Guilford County, NC, denial of a permit to operate a hazardous waste facility. The county said, ``We don't really want your hazardous waste facility.'' They took them to court. A landfill operator contested a county's health and safety ordinance prohibiting the construction of additional landfills, even though people worried about their water supply. An outdoor advertising company challenged a Durham, NC, ordinance that limited the number of billboards in order to preserve the character of the city. A gravel mine operation challenged a Hempstead, NY, ordinance prohibiting excavation within 2 feet of the groundwater table that supplied water for the town.  I know how I would feel if I was a parent living in that town and my children were drinking that water.  An essential part of land use policy is weighing one resident's concern over another to arrive at a decision in the community interest. We need to balance the rights of property owners with those of others in the same community.  Remember that all of us live downstream, downwind, or next door to property where pollution or unsuitable activities can harm our health or our safety or our property values.  This new challenge to local government is more dangerous than the legislation we defeated last Congress. Take a look at the groups opposing this legislation. These are the groups in opposition. Every major State and local government organization opposes this bill: National Governors' Association; National Association of Counties; National League of Cities; U.S. Conference of Mayors; National Association of Town and Townships; National Conference of State Legislatures; the Judicial Conference of the United States; religious organizations: United States Catholic Conference; National Council of Churches of Christ; Religious Action Center for Reform Judaism; Evangelicals for Social Action; the League of Women Voters; Alliance for Justice; Physicians for Social Responsibility; National Trust for Historic Preservation; National Wildlife Federation; League of Conservation Voters; the Sierra Club; the National Environmental Trust, and on and on and on and on.  Every major conservation group opposes this bill. Civil rights groups, religious groups, labor groups, public interest groups, preservation groups, all oppose this bill.  Let's not overlook the threat to our court system when we are looking at the threat to our State and local government. As I said earlier, S. 2271 could significantly boost the workload of our already overburdened Federal court system. By making a Federal case out of local zoning decisions, we are going to rush zoning decisions into the Federal court before the local public process has even had a chance to work out some kind of alternative the community might want. Instead of allowing our communities to try to work it out themselves, we say, whoops, it is out of your hands entirely; we are going to turn it over to a Federal judge.  And think of the cost of dramatically increasing the workload of Federal courts. It is going to cause a lot greater delay in existing Federal court workload, even if the Senate did do its duty and confirm those dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of judges waiting confirmation. And, of course, that is why the Judicial Conference of the United States, the Conference of Chief Justices, and 38 State attorneys general all oppose this bill.  The contradictions presented by this bill, contradicting what the majority leadership of this Senate says they want, are amazing. The legislation turns the goal of increasing local jurisdiction and decisionmaking on its head. It seems to abandon the respect for local decisions that so many in this body espoused during the takings debate during the 104th Congress.  Statements were made just last year--is our memory so short as Senators that we forget that last year statements were made that legislation should only apply to the Federal Government and not impact State or local zoning laws? This legislation directly threatens local authority.  Another seemingly obvious contradiction this legislation offers is to the ``judicial activism'' rallying cry of some in the matter of judicial appointments--just a matter of how selective some of those same people can be about judicial activism unless, of course, we think they might act on behalf of our supporters.  Rebutting their own criticism of activist judges, this bill will encourage judges to intervene in problems that belong in legislatures or city councils.  So with all of these contradictions and with the overwhelming opposition to this dangerous legislation, why is Congress considering such sweeping changes to the balance of power between local officials and developers?  That is a question being asked of us across the country. The Manchester, NH, Union Leader, not considered the most liberal newspaper in America--in fact, usually considered the most conservative--posed that question to theHouse when it took up the bill, when they said this bill is a ``conservative flip-flop,'' and they said ``let's not federalize local zoning disputes.''  They thought, and they said it is ``. . . a good guess that this bill will die quietly in the Senate, enabling House conservatives to tell their backers we `gave it our best shot.' ''  Well, there they go again, because now we are wasting valuable floor time on a bill the President has pledged to veto. This legislative proposal is unwarranted. It is unwise. We have to do a lot better for our local towns and communities and for local homeowners.  I have a statement of administration policy and a letter. I ask unanimous consent to have those printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   Statement of Administration Policy          S. 2271--Property Rights Implementation Act of 1998       The Administration strongly opposes S. 2271 because it      would shift authority over local land use issues away from      local communities and State courts to Federal courts. The      bill would subject local communities to the threat of      premature, expensive Federal court litigation that would      favor wealthy developers over neighboring property owners and      the community at large. The President will veto S. 2271 or      any similar legislation.       S. 2271 would harm neighboring property owners, weaken      local public health and environmental protections, and      diminish the quality of life by undermining local land use      planning. Through radical changes to the existing legal      doctrine of ripeness, the bill would give developers      inappropriate leverage in their dealings with local officials      by making it easier to sue local communities far earlier in      the land use planning process. S. 2271 also purports to allow      takings claimants to circumvent State courts altogether.       The bill would violate constitutional limits on      congressional power if read, as its supporters intend, to      allow for a ruling that an uncompensated taking has occurred      even where the claimant fails to pursue available State      compensation remedies. The bill also would prohibit Federal      courts from ``abstaining'' or deferring to State courts on      certain delicate issues of State law. It would lead to poorly      informed decisions by allowing claimants to bring claims in      Federal courts without an adequate factual record, the very      claims that the courts themselves have said are unripe for      resolution.       S. 2271 would empower the U.S. Court of Federal Claims to      invalidate Federal statutes and rules and grant other      injunctive relief in a broad category of cases. This grant of      authority to a non-Article III court raises a host of serious      constitutional and policy concerns.       The bill provides that, by including a property rights      claim, any litigant against the United States could ensure      that the entire case would be reviewed on appeal by the U.S.      Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, an approach that      would promote inappropriate forum-shopping. This would      dramatically increase the legal influence of the Federal      Circuit at the expense of other circuits, thereby disrupting      settled interpretations of important areas of the law.       S. 2271 also could override the ``preclusive review''      provisions found in many Federal statutes, including major      environmental laws. These provisions allow for the swift and      orderly resolution of challenges to Federal actions. S. 2271      would deprive affected businesses and the public of the      regulatory stability needed to plan their actions.                                  ____         National Governors' Association, National Association of            Counties, National Conference of State Legislatures,            National League of Cities, United States Conference of            Mayors,                                                    July 10, 1998.       To All Senators: On behalf of the nation's governors, state      legislators, and local elected officials, we are writing to      express our strong opposition to S. 2271, the ``Private      Property Rights Implementation Act of 1998.'' We believe the      proposed legislation, including the proposed technical      amendments, would fundamentally interfere with and preempt      the traditional and historic rights and responsibilities of      state and local governments and would mandate significant      new, unfunded costs for all state and local taxpayers.       State and local elected officials are as deeply committed      to protecting private property rights as are members of      Congress. A review of the most recent proposed revisions to      the legislation makes clear that those changes do not address      our fundamental problems with the bill. We continue to      believe that S. 2271 goes far beyond its stated objectives.       If passed, the bill would undermine state and local      government authority over land use and regulatory decisions      by allowing developers and property owners to take their      grievances directly to federal court, circumventing legal      remedies at the state and local level. Such an ``end run''      around the processes established by our state laws runs      counter to the foundations of federalism that this Congress      purports to endorse. The bill preempts the traditional system      for resolving local zoning, land use, and regulatory      disputes; it creates a disincentive for developers to      negotiate with localities in order to reach mutually      agreeable solutions; and it puts federal judges in the      position of micromanaging purely local affairs. We believe      that large-scale developers will use the expedited access to      federal courts under S. 2271 as a ``club'' to intimidate      local officials who are charged with acting in the best      interests of the community as a whole.       The framers of the Constitution never intended federal      courts to be the first resort in resolving community disputes      between local governments and private parties. In our view,      these issues should be settled locally, as close to the      affected community as possible. S. 2271 violates our      cherished principles of federalism and state and local      sovereignty. We urge you to oppose floor action on S. 2271.           Sincerely,     Governor George V. Voinovich,       Chairman, National Governors' Association.     Senator Richard Finan,       President, Ohio Senate, President, National Conference of      State Legislatures.
