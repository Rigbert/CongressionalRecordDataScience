We introduced a bill on Friday. Because the Speaker will not bring up the bill, we have to use very unusual procedures to force a bill on the floor, which we expect will come up tomorrow sometime after 11 o'clock, under very prescribed rules where we will have very little opportunity to debate. But we have not been able to get any hearings in the committees of any significance. We have not been able to get a bill. The executive branch did this completely on their own, without the Congress being involved.
