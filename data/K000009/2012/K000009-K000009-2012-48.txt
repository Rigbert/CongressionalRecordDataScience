Speaker, yesterday, our Nation remembered and commemorated the 68th anniversary of D-day, the World War II allied invasion of Normandy, France, and the beginning of the liberation of Europe from the forces of tyranny.  Today, I want to commemorate another historical World War II battle--70 years ago, the Battle of Midway, when the United States Navy struck back at imperial Japan, turning the tide in the Pacific and paving the way toward a great American victory at sea.  Six months earlier, Japanese planes infamously attacked Pearl Harbor, drawing the United States into that war. Yet our Navy recovered quickly and mobilized under the leadership of Admiral Ernest King, from the port city of Lorain, Ohio, on Lake Erie, and Admiral Chester Nimitz.  With the odds against them, our U.S. Navy boldly struck back at the Battle of Midway. Over 4 days, the Japanese lost all four of the large carriers that had attacked Pearl Harbor, not to mention a heavy cruiser, 248 carrier-based aircraft, and more than 3,000 men. The United States lost one carrier, the Yorktown, one destroyer, and 340 men.  Today, we commemorate this major historic achievement of our Navy. We honor the sacrifice of those who fought for us and died for us, and we express abiding gratitude for the bravery and dedication of all who fought in this battle in service to our Nation and freedom's cause.  Today, the free world remembers the Battle of Midway.                          ____________________
