President, first, I thank the distinguished chair of the committee for her cooperation and help, and also commend her and her distinguished ranking member for moving this far along.                    Amendment No. 3916, As Modified  Mr. President, a major weakness uncovered after 9/11 was the failure of Government agencies to share information with one another. The 9/11 Commission recommended a government-wide information system to ensure that we connect the dots. The Commission also recommended that the ``[p]rotection of privacy rights should be one key element'' of implementing the system. Given the sweeping powers that Congress is about to grant for building an information sharing system, we have to protect the privacy and civil liberties of the American people.  After all, we fought a Revolution to guarantee our privacy. The distinguished Presiding Officer and the distinguished chair know, because they come from New England, that the Revolution was fought on our soil.  We all agree we must maximize this information, but we must also maximize the protection of personal information. And we need assurances that private information will be protected before we build the system, not after. We certainly do not want to repeat what happened with CAPPS II, when $100 million of taxpayer money was spent on deploying a system that then subsequently collapsed because we failed to adequately account for civil liberties and privacy concerns.  My amendment, which has been modified to reach an agreement with Senators Collins and Lieberman, would require that we take advantage of available privacy-enhancing technology that would prevent unauthorized dissemination of information. It also requires the Administration to fulfill its obligations to report to Congress on plans for the network before spending funds to build it. This oversight is critical to ensuring the network maximizes security while balancing civil liberties and privacy.  Senators Collins and Lieberman have agreed to accept this important amendment.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to call up amendment No. 3916, and that it be modified.
