Speaker, I would like to extend deepest thanks to Congressman Garamendi for sharing his time with us and, also, to Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, who has been waiting almost an hour to share her memories of a very great American.  We are here this evening, Mr. Speaker, and we rise to honor the illustrious career of a dear friend and stellar colleague, the late Congressman Louis Stokes from Cleveland, Ohio.  Our hearts are heavy, but immensely grateful for his path-breaking life and legendary generous service. As the first African American Member of Congress elected to serve from Ohio, he wrote new history for America, for Ohio, every day of his life.  Rising from the public housing projects of Cleveland, he and his brother Carl became revered as they built a more inclusive and representative America. What courage and passion that required.  A proud, personable, and gracious man whose fashion and manner exuded dignity, it was actually never his aspiration to be a politician. He opted instead to serve the local neighborhoods of Cleveland, where he grew up, after returning from 3 years of service in the U.S. Army during World War II.  After using his GI benefits to go to college, Lou served in the Veterans Administration and the Treasury Department before attending law school. He loved the law. He loved being a lawyer, and he loved writing laws here.  His enlightened leadership moved America forward socially, economically, and legally. In Congress, his gentlemanly demeanor and sharp intellect allowed him to chair, again, as the first African American, the Appropriations subcommittee on Veterans, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies.  As a much newer, younger Member of Congress, I had the great privilege of serving under him as he chaired that important committee.  He also chaired the House Select Committee on Assassinations and served on the House Select Committee to investigate covert arms transactions with Iran. His agile legal mind was evident in the investigations he conducted.  The people of Cleveland and Ohio have been blessed throughout his life and hold abiding gratitude for his extraordinary accomplishments and generous spirit. I can still hear his laugh.  I am privileged, actually, to have served with Congressman Stokes for almost a quarter century and hold lasting memories of his deep love for his wife, for his mother, for his brother, for his children, and his grandchildren.  He had indefatigable and inspired efforts to gain respect and equal justice in the law for all of our citizens. And he saw progress, great progress, in his lifetime that we have so far to go.  I witnessed his perseverance in building America's communities forward and his dedication to meeting our Nation's obligations to veterans, to advance space science, and to catapult Cleveland's health and human services to the top rung of national assets.  I have so many memories of Congressman Stokes. I can remember one time in a subcommittee he had the head of Arlington Cemetery come up, and he had these big volumes that he brought with him of who were the veterans who were interred there.  And Congressman Stokes pointed out to the entire committee, ``Go down and read the roster.'' And the roster said, ``No name,'' ``No name,'' ``No name,'' ``No name.'' And Congressman Stokes informed us that, in fact, those were Africa Americans who had died in service to our country, but they were buried with no name at Arlington. And he made sure that that area was especially recognized, and he was writing history for America for the first time.  I thought, wow, this isn't 1870. This was in the 1980s and 1990s. He was a great teacher.  I shall sorely miss his dogged determination, easy smile, keen and measured counsel, and persevering nature.  The last time we were together was at a Fair Housing meeting in Cleveland, Ohio, just a few months ago. Looking back on his generous attendance at age 90 and looking in really great shape, I think it was his way--he hadn't told anyone yet what was ailing him, but I think it was his way of saying good-bye.  What a gracious gentleman he was. What a gifted leader has lived among us.  I am going to place in the Congressional Record a special story that was in the Cleveland Plain Dealer entitled, ``Lou Stokes--The Congressman, Leading Lawyer, and Towering Political Presence Has Died,'' written by Brent Larkin, Tom Diemer, and Sabrina Eaton of the Northeast Ohio Media Group.  Though I won't read the entire article into the record tonight, let me just read a few sentences:  ``We have been blessed as a family with a legacy we can always be proud of,'' Lou Stokes said. ``Together with Carl''--his brother--``we made a name that stood for something. What greater honor could have come to two brothers who grew up in poverty here in Cleveland?''  And he tells a story about his mother. He would always get tears in his eyes when he would talk of his mother. She had become ill at one point, and he went to visit her.  And he said, ``I took her hands to give her some comfort and, when I felt those hard, cold hands from scrubbing floors in order to give me an education, I began to understand what her life was about, what her life meant.'' And that piercing memory Lou carried with him every day of his life.  ``Beginning in junior high school, Stokes took jobs delivering the Cleveland News, shining shoes, and working in a small factory that made canned whipped cream.''  When he was 16, a man named Isadore Apisdorf hired him to perform odd jobs at his Army-Navy surplus store on lower Prospect Avenue. Seeing something in the youngster, Apisdorf ignored the risk to his business in those days and hired Stokes as a salesman.  When speaking of his early years, Stokes always remembered to mention the kindness demonstrated to him by a man ``who sort of acted like a father to me,'' Congressman Stokes said.  Stokes graduated from Central High School in 1943. And with World War II raging, he joined the Army and was assigned to a segregated unit that remained Stateside, mainly in the south.  Stokes recalled a layover his unit once had in Memphis where a group ofGerman prisoners of war in a train station restaurant were treated better than the Black soldiers.  Louis Stokes embodied so many memories and so much progress that he helped not just Cleveland, not just Ohio, but our country and people everywhere to persevere, no matter what the odds.  I shall miss him. What a gifted leader has lived among us. I know all of the people of Ohio join me, as do our colleagues, in saying: May the angels carry him to a deserved, peaceful rest close to the heart of God.  There are other Members that wish to speak this evening. I just feel very honored to be here. I can still see Lou in the cloakroom in the back with his good friend, Bill Clay, and some of the guys. We weren't included, as women, in those conversations, but we respected them.  And he was always cordial. He always sort of stood halfway turned so he could say hello to those Members going by. He had a special gracious manner about him.                  [From Cleveland.com, Aug. 19, 2015]  Lou Stokes--The Congressman, Leading Lawyer and Towering Political                            Presence Has Died                           (By Brent Larkin)       Cleveland, OH.--Louis Stokes, whose iconic career in public      life assures him a place as one of the most revered,      respected and powerful figures in Cleveland history, died      Tuesday night.       He was 90.       The older brother of former Mayor Carl B. Stokes had an      aggressive form of cancer, diagnosed in late June.       A proud, personable and gracious man whose dress and manner      exuded dignity, Stokes never wanted to be a politician,      aspiring instead to become Cleveland's leading black lawyer.       But the reluctant officeholder who came to Congress in 1969      left it 30 years later as a towering political figure both in      Washington and at home.       Mayor Frank Jackson was one of dozens to publicly mourn the      death of his longtime friend.       ``Congressman Louis Stokes' long career in public life was      a model of how to serve with dignity, integrity and honor,''      Jackson said. ``His service paved the way for many who would      follow in both public and private careers. I know full well      that, but for him, I would have never had the opportunity to      become mayor.''       For more than three decades, Stokes, his brother, former      Council President George Forbes, and former Cleveland School      Board President Arnold Pinkney dominated every aspect of      black political life in the city.       Now, only Forbes survives.       ``The four of us had parallel careers in public life,''      Forbes said. ``It was not unusual for some of the things we      did or said to be questioned. But not Lou Stokes. If he said      it, or did it, it was like a pronouncement from Sinai. It was      the gospel. It was the last word. No one disagreed with      him.''       Stokes' resume in the House included stints as chairman of      the select committee that from 1976 to 1978 investigated the      assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther      King Jr., chairman of the House Ethics Committee, a member of      the House select committee that investigated the Iran-Contra      affair, and the first black to chair the Intelligence      Committee and serve on the influential House Appropriations      Committee.       In Cleveland, Stokes' political muscle was the 21st      Congressional District Caucus, a political organization      founded by his late brother that became so powerful, its      ability to influence election outcomes sometimes surpassed      that of the Cuyahoga County Democratic Party.       When Stokes and the caucus urged Democrats in his district      to vote against a sitting Democratic president in the Ohio      presidential primary in 1980, they did just that, supporting      Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy over President Jimmy Carter      by a margin of nearly 2-1.       Stokes never lost an election. Nor did he forget where he      came from.       And he never strayed from his commitment to expand      political and economic opportunities for minorities.       In an interview at his home just a month before his death      and days after he learned of his terminal illness, Stokes      emotionally reminisced on his storybook life.       ``I was a very blessed guy,'' he began. ``I've been blessed      with the opportunity to participate in history, to rise to      opportunities I never envisioned . . . and to provide for      people opportunities that, in many cases, they would have      never had.       ``We have been blessed as a family with a legacy we can      always be proud of. Together with Carl, we made a name that      stood for something.       ``What greater honor could have come to two brothers who      grew up in poverty here in Cleveland?''                           Humble beginnings       Lou Stokes was born Feb. 23, 1925, the first of two      children born to Charles and Louise Stokes. Carl was born a      little more than two years later.       Their father died when Lou was three, and Louise Stokes      took an $8-a-day job as a domestic worker at homes in the      eastern suburbs. To help raise the young boys in their small      apartment on East 69th Street, Louise's mother moved to      Cleveland from Georgia.       Stokes spoke often and with great emotion of his mother,      and her repeated lectures on the importance of an education.       ``One night, she was lying in bed ill and I went into her      room and sat with her,'' Stokes recalled during an interview      last year at the Maltz Museum of Jewish Heritage.       ``I took her hands to give her some comfort. And when I      felt those hard, cold hands from scrubbing floors in order to      give me an education, I began to understand what she meant.''       Beginning in junior high, Stokes took jobs delivering the      Cleveland News, shining shoes and working in a small factory      that made canned whip cream.       When Stokes was 16, Isadore Apisdorf hired him to perform      odd jobs at his Army-Navy surplus store on lower Prospect      Avenue. Seeing something in the youngster, Apisdorf ignored      the risks to his business and hired Stokes as a salesman.       When speaking of his early years, Stokes always remembered      to mention the kindness demonstrated to him by a man ``who      sort of acted like a father to me.''       Stokes graduated from Central High School in 1943. With      World War II raging, he joined the Army and was assigned to a      segregated unit that remained stateside, mainly in the South.      Stokes recalled a layover his unit once had in Memphis where      a group of German prisoners of war in a train station      restaurant were treated better than the black soldiers.       After the war, Stokes attended Western Reserve University      on the G.I. Bill. He worked for a time for the Veterans      Administration and Treasury Department before graduating from      Cleveland State University's Cleveland Marshall College of      Law in 1953.       Stokes opened up a small law office on St. Clair Avenue,      and was later joined by his brother. Carl also became a      lawyer and, in 1962, became the first black Democrat elected      to the Ohio House.       Around this time, Stokes drew the attention of Norman      Minor, considered one of the greatest lawyers in Ohio history      and the greatest black lawyer Cleveland ever produced.       ``I tried to be like Norman Minor in every way I could,''      Stokes recalled in 2014. ``Carl loved politics. I didn't have      that love. I loved being a lawyer.''                             Making history       On the night of Nov. 7, 1967, Stokes sat with Martin Luther      King Jr. in the Rockefeller Building just west of Public      Square, and experienced what he described as ``a pioneering      political event for America''--Carl Stokes' election as the      nation's first black, big-city mayor.       In 1965 and again two years later, King had made numerous      trips to Cleveland aimed at registering blacks to vote. Carl      Stokes lost the 1965 mayoral primary by about 1,700 votes.      Two years later, he beat Republican Seth Taft by about 2,500      votes.       Lou Stokes said King was ``tremendously helpful'' to his      brother in both those elections.       Less than a month after his brother's winning election,      Stokes enjoyed his own first moment of fame, arguing a case      before the U.S. Supreme Court.       The case involved John Terry, a Cleveland man suspected of      preparing to rob a Euclid Avenue store downtown in 1963.      Terry and two others were stopped on the sidewalk by a      Cleveland policeman, who frisked Terry and found a gun.       The landmark case of Terry v. Ohio upheld the arrest, but      allowed police to stop and frisk suspects only when the      officer has a ``reasonable suspicion'' the suspect is about      to commit a crime, and may be armed and dangerous.       That same year, another landmark Supreme Court ruling known      as ``one man, one vote'' led to Carl Stokes and Gov. James      Rhodes collaborating in the creation of a new, majority-     minority congressional district comprised of Cleveland's East      Side and some eastern suburbs.       At his brother's urging, a reluctant Lou Stokes put his law      career on hold and became a candidate. In the Democratic      primary, Stokes beat 13 opponents, including George Forbes,      Leo Jackson and George White.       In January 1969, Stokes entered Congress along with Shirley      Chisholm of New York and William ``Bill'' Clay of Missouri.      Their elections brought to nine the number of blacks in      Congress.       Stokes immediately began to make his mark, becoming a      founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus a little      more than a year after taking office.       Always served well by his personality, Stokes was a tall,      hard-working man with a loud, infectious laugh. His gentle      nature masked a steely commitment--and, at times, he was      viewed as a bit too thin-skinned. Nevertheless, among his      colleagues, Stokes was always considered one of the body's      most popular members.       When Tip O'Neill became speaker of the U.S. House in 1977,      Stokes' career took off. O'Neill's respect for Stokes earned      him prestigious and powerful committee assignments, which      often translated into federal spending on projects important      to Cleveland.       ``We had a very special relationship,'' Stokes said of      O'Neill during his July 14 interview. ``He used to call me      `Louie, my pal.' He gave me some very tough assignments.''       In 1987, Stokes had a memorable back-and-forth with Oliver      North during the Iran-Contra hearings, telling the Marine      Corps lieutenant colonel, ``While I admire your love for      America, I just hope you will never forget that others, too,      love America just as much as you do--and . . . will die for      America just as quickly as you will.''                            The power broker       Back in Cleveland, the 1971 decision by Carl Stokes to      leave town for a television career in New York instead of      seeking a third term as mayor created a significant power      vacuum within the black political establishment.       Stokes moved decisively to fill that vacuum, and Democratic      leaders awarded him a co-chairmanship of the county party.      But Forbes and Arnold Pinkney were becoming powerful black      political figures in their own right.       For the next 10 to 15 years, the inevitable tensions that      arise with power-sharing led to public disagreements and some      angry private moments--with Call and Post founder and      publisher W.O. Walker often serving as a mediator.       Over time, those strains disappeared. And while Forbes      would eventually cement a legacy as the most powerful City      Council president in Cleveland history and Pinkney twice      waged competitive campaigns for mayor and became a nationally      recognized political consultant, there was never any doubt      who owned the magic political name.       That name at times moved Stokes and the 21st Congressional      District Caucus to part ways with the Democratic Party. And      Stokes was not above using the caucus as a weapon to punish      and defeat candidates he believed did not deserve black      votes.       The caucus' influence was often most pronounced in down-     the-ballot races for judge and other offices. But in the 1977      election for mayor, one of the most competitive and dramatic      in the city's history, support from the Stokes brothers      probably made the difference in Dennis Kucinich's victory      over Democratic Party-backed Edward Feighan.       Tim Hagan served as Feighan's de facto campaign manager.      Several months after the election, he would become chairman      of the county's Democratic Party.       ``If Congressman Stokes was with you, it gave you      unquestioned credibility with the people he represented,''      said Hagan. ``It made the difference between winning or      losing an election. Lou's endorsement was the most important      endorsement a candidate sought.''       There were a few stumbles, but none major. And they did      little or nothing to tarnish Stokes' relationship with his      constituents. [In 1983, following a late-night session of      Congress, he was convicted on a minor charge of driving under      the influence and also of running a red light; Stokes said he      was overly tired but sober, but decided not to appeal the      jury verdict.] In the early 1990s, he had 551 overdrafts at      the House Bank, most for small amounts.       In 1993, Stokes reached the height of his power in      Congress, joining the prestigious ``College of Cardinals''      when he became chair of the Appropriations subcommittee for      the Veterans Administration and Housing and Urban      Development. It was a position that gave Stokes enormous say      in how and where tens of billions in federal dollars were      spent. The Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center on East      105th Street is one of several Cleveland buildings named in      his honor.       But his enthusiasm for the job would soon wane. In 1994,      Republicans took control of the House. Two years later, at      age 71, Stokes had open heart surgery at the Cleveland Clinic      and a tumor removed from his vocal cords.       When, in April 1996, Carl Stokes died of cancer, Stokes      lost his best friend.                             The denouement       By 1998, after 30 years in office, Stokes decided not to      seek re-election.       On the day he announced his retirement, Plain Dealer      columnist Elizabeth Auster wrote, ``Stokes brought more than      money home from Washington. He also brought laughter and      inspiration and pride. And sometimes those are harder to come      by.''       Then-Cleveland Mayor Michael White said of Stokes,      ``Someone will fill his seat, but I don't think anyone will      ever fill his shoes.''       It was always a foregone conclusion Stokes' job would pass      to Stephanie Tubbs Jones, county prosecutor at the time. When      Tubbs Jones died unexpectedly in 2008, Marcia Fudge became      only the third person to hold the seat.       In retirement, Stokes became senior counsel at the      Cleveland-based law firm of what was then Squire Sanders &      Dempsey. He served on several corporate boards, including      Forest City Enterprises.       When asked in the July interview about the lack of civility      in Washington today, Stokes said he was sometimes embarrassed      to be a former member of Congress.       ``I have members of Congress whom I see, on both sides of      the aisle, and they tell me, `Louie, you wouldn't want to be      here now.' It's a waste of your time and intellect to be      involved there now and see how difficult it is to concentrate      on doing what's best for people--considering you were sent      there to help people. That's gone now.''       Stokes retired from the law firm in 2012, and resigned from      the Forest City board last year. In recent months, he spent      time assisting his daughter, Cleveland Municipal Court Judge      Angela Stokes, who is contesting disciplinary charges filed      against her by the Ohio Supreme Court's Disciplinary Counsel.       Besides Angela, he is survived by his wife of 55 years,      Jeanette (Jay); daughter Shelley Stokes-Hammond, retired      public affairs director at Howard University; daughter Lori,      a television news anchor in New York City; son Chuck,      editorial and public affairs director at a Detroit television      station; and seven grandchildren.       Funeral arrangements are pending.
