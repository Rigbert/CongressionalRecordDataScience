 Last week, as for many of us, I first heard about Juanita's illness. That is surprising because there is a group of us on both sides of the aisle that fly back and forth to California every week. I know there is a lot of talk about partisanship nowadays, but we have a pretty close group. Many times we sit next to each other on the airplane, and we talk about parents and children and golf or whatever. And Juanita was always a delight to be with, always had a positive attitude, always someone you looked forward to seeing.  I was deeply saddened to hear of Juanita's sudden passing. I was sitting at home writing a note to her this weekend; and, unfortunately, that note can't be delivered. But I hope she is listening right now as we state our condolences to her family and to her friends.  It has certainly been an honor for me to have worked with her for the last 11 years that she served in Congress. She was a faithful representative of her district.  I worked with her specifically on the C-17 factory in Long Beach, California, where they make the great C-17 aircraft, and she was a champion for that. She worked for the employees that worked at that plant to make sure that the aircraft which is doing a wonderful job for our country continues to be manufactured in Long Beach, California. As a matter of fact, the last conversation I had with her was about what we can do to keep that going.  There are no words I can use to convey the sense of loss when a colleague passes. She was a champion, and a champion for California. Our delegation will miss her very much. We will miss her smile.  I join all of my colleagues in supporting this bereavement resolution and extend my sympathies to her families and friends. Juanita Millender-McDonald was a patriot who faithfully served her country. Her contributions and commitment will not be forgotten.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
