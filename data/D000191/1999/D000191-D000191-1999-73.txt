Many of the most successful drugs were not from the pharmaceutical companies. That is what they say, we need those obscene profits to invest in research. That is not where the money goes. It goes to the stockholders, the chief executive officers, and other places. Yes, some of it goes into research, but not an inordinate amount. In fact, many of the most successful drugs are a result of research done by the National Institutes of Health. When a private company takes their research and produces and markets a drug with exclusive rights for 8 to 10 years, as happened recently with a drug for uterine cancer, this was doubly ironic, not only was the research done and the drug developed by the National Institutes of Health, at total taxpayer expense, the product, before they developed an artificial one, which produced the drug was harvested off of Federal lands, yew bark. So this company was given not only the exclusive right to use and sell these drugs which were taxpayer-created but they were also given exclusive rights to go out and harvest the yew bark off of Federal lands, and no controls were put on their profits. None. That is absolutely obscene.  The gentleman has tried over a number of years to say, here is a simple principle. If a drug company takes the public research, patents it and puts it into a drug, then we should get some reimbursement, the taxpayers should get some reimbursement for that drug development. You might even talk about that.
