 President, I was pleased to cosponsor the provision of the Senator from West Virginia for an Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee program when the Committee on Appropriations reported the bill to the Senate earlier this month. I felt then, as I do now, that many steel companies have suffered significant economic injury as a result of the illegal dumping of foreign steel. In my own State of Alabama, at least one steel mill I know of is now teetering on the brink of bankruptcy due to this illegal activity. I was, therefore, very pleased by the Senator from West Virginia's effort to address this problem and provide some short-term needed relief to our steel companies. I know Senator Sessions shares my support for this provision because of our concern with the plight of local steel mills in our State of Alabama.
