 President, the Stop Excessive Energy Speculation Act of 2008 that the Senate is going to move to proceed to will shine a light on those trading markets. It will increase oversight and reporting on oil trading, and it will significantly improve the resources available to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. While addressing speculation is not the silver bullet that will bring prices down at the pump, we do believe that by increasing our oversight and regulation, we will ensure that consumers are better protected in the months and years to come.  Unfortunately, as I mentioned earlier, our friends on the other side have their message down pretty pat now.
