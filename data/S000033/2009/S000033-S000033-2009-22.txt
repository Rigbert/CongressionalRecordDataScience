 Organizationally, it has the support of the AFL-CIO, the National Education Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, the United Steelworkers of America, AFSCME, the American Postal Workers Union, and a number of other organizations representing millions of working people. This is not a complicated issue. Somebody will have to pay for this bill. Should it be the middle class and working families or should it be the people at the top two one-hundredths of 1 percent who, over the period of the last 8 or 9 years, have enjoyed huge tax breaks? This is kind of a no-brainer.  The good news here is that our friends in the House have moved correctly in this area. The bill before us in the Senate does not. What we are trying to do is to get an amendment to take out the tax on health care benefits and replace it with similar language, not exactly the same as exists in the House.
