 President, I do not quite know what to do. I would very much like to have a vote on this matter. I have tried to importune the conferees. I am told the Governor of California, Mr. Schwarzenegger, now inducted as Governor, has indicated his support for the removal of this amendment. It is my understanding that a whole panoply of States oppose this provision.  It is clear to me this is a bad thing. It is clear to me this is going to set back the cause of clean air. It is clear to me this is going to impact youngsters and the elderly with asthma and other lung diseases. It is clear to me that it is going to impact our transportation dollars. It is clear to me that by 2010, because of one company, California is going to have deal with 70 additional tons of smog per day. None of this needs to happen.  I regret that I cannot send an amendment to the desk. I regret I am not being allowed a vote on the amendment. But this is the wrong thing to do.  I yield the floor, Mr. President.                               Exhibit 1                                           Southeastern States Air                                      Resource Managers, Inc.,                                                November 10, 2003.     Hon. Zell Miller,     Dirksen Senate Office Bldg.,     Washington, DC.       Dear Sen. Miller: Southeastern States Air Resource      Managers, Inc. (SESARM), representing the directors of the      southeastern state air pollution control agencies in Alabama,      Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina,      South Carolina, and Tennessee, is writing this letter to      encourage your support of the removal of a position      introduced by Senator Bond in S. 1584, the Fiscal Year 2004      VA, HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriations Bill. The      provision would amend Section 209(e)(1)(A) of the Clean Air      Act to curtail a state's authority to reduce emissions from      diesel and gasoline off-road equipment and engines.       While Senator Bond's proposed provision regarding the off-     road engines apparently was intended to address rules adopted      only in California, it will limit the ability of all states      to solve serious public health-related air quality problems.      Senator Bond's proposal revises a very important provision of      the Clean Air Act which allows states to adopt engine      emission standards more stringent than the federal standards      as long as appropriate federal review processes are followed.      Congress wisely put this provision into the Act to give      states the ability to deal with serious air quality problems      across the country. SESARM opposes the impact of the Bond      proposal on this important provision.       Please note that other compromise amendments which fall      short of fully restoring Section 209(e)(1)(A) are, in our      opinion, unacceptable and will constrain states as discussed      above. SESARM and your state air pollution control agency      would appreciate your support of removal of the Bond      Amendment from S. 1584.           Sincerely,                                                 John E. Hornback,                                               Executive Director.                                       ____                               Exhibit 2                           California Fire Chiefs Association,                                                November 11, 2003.     Sen. Dianne Feinstein,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Sen. Feinstein: The California Fire Chiefs Association      (CFCA) has been expressing concerns about the potential fire      hazard posed by catalytic converters that may be required for      certain lawnmowers and other outdoor power equipment. In just      the past few days, out concerns seem to be receiving      significant attention.       After further investigation we have determined that there      were some misunderstandings between CFCA representatives and      the California Air Resources Board (CARB) as it relates to      the regulations.       The fire safety issues we raised need more attention and      require independent assessment before engineering and      production decisions are made. In our most recent discussions      with CARB, they support the idea of an independent study, and      have proposed moving forward with a study, much the same as      what is now underway with catalytic converters being used in      marine applications. We enthusiastically support this idea,      and will be working closely with CARB, the Sate Fire Marshal,      and the US Environmental Protection Agency to ensure that all      fire safety concerns are addressed. We wish to make clear      that we regard fire safety and environmental quality as being      equally important, and wish to make it clear that we support      without reservation the air quality goals of the proposed      requirements. We support the regulation moving forward as we      have received assurances from CARB that our safety concerns      will be addressed through the independent study.       Finally, we understand that as a separate matter, the      Senate is debating the question of whether states are free to      develop safety and environmental standards. We were never      asked to comment on this matter, but for the record, we do      not support legislation that would interfere with a state's      ability to protect its own citizens. To the contrary, we have      had to count on the Sate of California to develop fire safety      standards for upholstered furniture, mattresses and bedding      because the federal government has failed to do so. The      issues of fire safety and air quality as they relate to      outdoor power equipment can be addressed, and I believe      that working closely with CARB we will find a solution      that will provide a high degree of fire safety while      maintaining CARB's goals for air quality.       In closing, allow me to express my personal apologies to      you. We were not aware that you had an interest in this      matter or that we were engaged in anything beyond fire      safety. As you know, we have had our hands full in the past      month. Even so, if we had been aware of your interest, we      would have asked for your help in sorting through these      issues. You have always been there when we've needed your      help. We look forward to moving beyond the current issues and      working with you on higher levels of air quality and fire      safety for the communities of California.           Sincerely,                                          William J. McCammon,                                                        President,                               California Fire Chiefs Association.
