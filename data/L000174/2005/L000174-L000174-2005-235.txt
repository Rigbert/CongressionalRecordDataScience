President, the Senator from Utah and I are here to talk about something where somebody's schedule has been terribly changed, the schedule of his whole family. I am talking about Shawn Bentley and how all of us who knew him are offering our deepest sympathy for him.  Certain people on the Senate Judiciary Committee are like family, and Shawn had most Senators and staff among his many friends. He was extremely well liked on both sides of the aisle, both for who he was and for what he did.  In his decade as a senior intellectual property counsel to my friend from Utah, Senator Hatch, he touched every significant piece of legislation that we undertook: The Satellite Home Viewer Act, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Federal Trademark Dilution Act. Those were the significant ones. There are a lot of others, important ones, that he was intimately involved with. But he touched us not only with his skill as a lawyer, his devotion as a public servant, his generosity as a colleague, but especially just his innate decency as a human being.  I know that he was a loving and devoted husband, father, and son. Leaving behind a young family makes it even more tragic. I hope his family, his young daughters who did not begin to get enough time to know their father, will know that those of us in the Senate mourn his loss. It is a tragic one.  My wife Marcelle and I will keep him and his loved ones in our prayers.  I thank the distinguished senior Senator from Utah for arranging the time for us to speak.  I yield the floor.
