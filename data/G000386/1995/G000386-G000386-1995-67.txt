 President, I believe that the costs of conferences are underestimated. These estimates--which range as high as one-half million dollars per conference--do not take into account lost time on the bench for judges and their support staff, who also attend the conferences at taxpayer expense. And the taxpayers foot these expenses year after year. The party's over, Mr. President.  There is a word for this sort of thing: Boondoggle. I have fought against wasting taxpayer money my whole career in the Senate, and I am committed to fighting unnecessary spending in the judiciary.  Mr. President, under current law, Federal judges are required to host and attend these conferences. This amendment will change that so that judges have the flexibility not to call a judicial conference. This amendment would also give individual Federal judges the option of not attending a conference. This is fair, and permits Federal courts--which I believe will act responsibly in light of the Federal Government's budgetary constraints--to pitch in and tighten belts along with us in Congress and the executive branch.  As I have said, Mr. President, this amendment is about saving taxpayer dollars and priorities. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  Finally, I just want to say that this amendment should not be viewed as a general indictment of the Federal judiciary. For the most part, I think that the judiciary has taken responsible and important steps to reduce unnecessary spending. This amendment is simply targeted to a use of Federal funds that, in the opinion of this Senator, should be pruned.  Thank you, Mr. President.                               Exhibit 1                [From the Baltimore Sun, June 30, 1994]          Taxpayers Foot the Bill for Judges to Meet at Resort                           (by Marcia Myers)       As the federal judiciary struggles amid hiring freezes and      funding shortages for basic services, 150 judges from      Maryland and other parts of the Fourth Circuit converged      yesterday on the broad verandas, lush fairways and tennis      courts of the five-star Greebrier resort.       Their taxpayer-financed gathering will demand little work      in the afternoons and barely any at night--unless you count      one banquet and a sing-along led by U.S. Supreme Court Chief      Justice William H. Rehnquist. Of course, several hundred      lawyers pay their own way, and those who consider schmoozing      part of the job might argue that they're working tirelessly.       The cost to taxpayers for the four-day conference: about      $200,000.       Even some who appreciate the Greenbrier's pampering      question the propriety of the trip to the mountains of White      Sulphur Springs, W.Va.       ``As a taxpayer, I would probably complain,'' U.S. District      Judge William M. Nickerson said, while adding that the      meeting offers a good opportunity to talk informally with      other judges. ``I think a lot of the judges have some      concerns as taxpayers. Some feel it's more of a luxury than      it needs to be.''       Others are more direct in criticizing the annual      conference, for which taxpayers will pay up to $1,000 per      judge plus travel expenses. ``I don't think the expense is      justified on an annual basis,'' said U.S. District Judge      Frederic N. Smalkin.       Consider the schedule for the conference, which includes      district, magistrate and bankruptcy judges from Maryland,      North and South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia:       Day 1: Judges arrive--no activities are planned.       Day 2: Judges attend a morning session for about 3 hours to      discuss court business. No other activities are planned until      the Rehnquist sing-along that evening.       Day 3: A trio of one-hour lectures on ethics is scheduled.      At noon, the six new judges in the circuit offer brief      remarks. Nothing else is planned until an evening reception      and banquet.       Day 4: The morning features a panel discussion reviewing      major Supreme Court decisions of the 1993 term. That ends the      conference, although judges on committees may attend      additional meetings.       Meanwhile, conferees are encouraged to sign up for group      activities that include tennis, golf, bridge and hiking.      Among the resort's other amenities: three 18-hole      championship golf courses, fly fishing, skeet shooting,      horseback riding, swimming, and the Greenbrier Spa, Mineral      Baths & Salon.       ``Personally, I think it's of real value,'' Senior U.S.      District Judge John R. Hargrove said of the conference. ``Do      we have to cut our own throats just because Congress won't      give us more money? We still have to have training. We don't      go down there and sit around.''       Why not have a shorter meeting, strictly business, at a      less luxurious spot?       ``We tried that at least once in the 20 years since I came      here,'' said the circuit's Chief Judge, Sam J. Ervin III of      North Carolina. ``The afternoon sessions were not very      productive--nobody much came.       ``I think the most important thing about this conference is      that lawyers have an opportunity to mingle with the judges      and share their problems and difficulties.''       That talk could include concerns over the shrinking      resources of the federal courts. Amid a hiring freeze in      Maryland and across the nation, the courts are at 84 percent      of adequate staffing levels--the lowest ever, according to a      court official.       And the situation could get worse. Court officials worry      about funds for court security, courtroom deputies and      computers. Business that used to be done in a day in      Baltimore, for example, now can take several days because of      staffing shortages.       When asked how much the conference would cost taxpayers,      Circuit Executive Samuel W. Phillips said about $55,000. But      after acknowledging the $1,000 allowance for each judge, plus      travel and administrative expenses, he estimated the cost at      $175,000 to $200,000.       Mr. Phillips said he had checked many other hotels for a      better rate. But the Greenbrier includes two meals in its      room rate, which makes it cheaper, he said. A typical room      for two costs $434 a night, although the judges receive a      discount that he wouldn't disclose.       It's also one of the few hotels capable of accommodating      everybody--judges, spouses and lawyers--under one roof, he      said.       The government pays for judges' hotel rooms and meals. The      cost of recreation--at      the Greenbrier, golf fees are $80 and tennis courts are $23 an hour--     comes from each judge's own pocket.       The conference alternates every other year between the      Greenbrier and the Homestead, a similar resort in Hot      Springs, Va.       The judges are quick to note that attendance is required--     by law.       Congress passed a bill in the 1930s requiring judges in      each circuit to gather annually to consider court business.       As budget concerns have mounted in recent years, the law      was amended to require a meeting only once every two years.       Several circuits have cut back to biennial meetings, but      Judge Ervin said the Fourth Circuit had rejected that idea.                [From the Recorder, September 29, 1993]                  Times Are Tights, But Circuit Isn't                           (By Steve Albert)       Soon after money problems forced postponement of pay raises      for judicial employees and led federal judges to suspend      civil jury trials, the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals      spent about $600,000 to send 350 judges and lawyers to a      four-day conference at a luxury Santa Barbara beach resort.       While other circuits reacted to tight budgets this year by      canceling their retreats or deciding to hold them every other      year, the Ninth Circuit opted to go forward with its August      1993 conference and continue holding its retreat annually.       Circuit chief Judge J. Clifford Wallace called the      conference expenditures ``money well spent.'' Congress      mandates that circuits hold conferences, Wallace said, and      the retreats provide the only opportunity ``to bring together      people who have responsibility to improve the administration      of justice.''       Circuit and district judges, magistrates, bankruptcy      judges, U.S. attorneys, federal public defenders and court      clerks from nine Western states attend the conference. In      addition, the circuit's 27 active judges get together six      times a year, hold an annual winter symposium, and meet with      different judges once every year or two for continuing      education.       Estimates of government expenses for the Santa Barbara      conference were released last week shortly before the U.S.      House of Representatives appropriated $2.8 billion for the      judiciary for fiscal 1994, a 10 percent increase over this      year. A House/Senate conference committee is expected to      settle on the final number this week or next. The Senate      wants to give this judiciary just a 5 percent increase for      the new fiscal year, which begins Friday.       The cost estimate of the Ninth Circuit conference, prepared      by circuit executives at The Recorder's request, shows that      300 judges, prosecutors, public defenders and clerks traveled      to Santa Barbara by air at an average cost of $550 each.      Another 50 traveled by car from Los Angeles at an average      cost of $50. The attendees spent an average of $250 for room      and food each day of the four-day conference and an average      of $34 on check-out day. Add in about $27,000 for such items      as speakers' travel, printing and audiovisual material, and      the total bill for taxpayers was about $556,000. Because      judges submit individual expense vouchers, that figure is an      estimate only.       The figure does not include the cost of travel during the      rest of the year for the 12 judges who meet four times      annually to help plan the conference.       About 100 other attendees, mostly lawyers in private      practice, paid their own way.                          $100 million bailout       The conference came just eight months after the U.S.      Judicial Conference--the governing body of the federal      courts--imposed a hiring freeze and postponed some pay      increases for federal court employees in the Ninth Circuit      and around the country. At the same time, the Judicial      Conference's executive committee trimmed court operating      expenses as well as probation and pretrial services funding,      citing a $100 million operating shortfall.       In June, citing a lack of funds to pay jurors, federal      trial courts around the country briefly suspended some civil      jury trials, Congress passed a $100 million bailout for the      courts in early July.       The budget shortfall prompted Wallace in May to propose      that many indigents who need court-appointed lawyers be asked      to repay the government for the cost of their defense, much      as students are required to pay off student loans for college      tuition. The savings, he theorized, could be used to avoid      funding shortfalls.       But Wallace said Monday that despite budgetary problems,      the conference remained an essential expense. He cited the      circuit's recently released study of gender bias in the      courts and its decision to study bias based on race, religion      and ethnicity as examples of the work the conference takes      on.       ``No one can doubt the importance of those issues,''      Wallace said. ``It would be difficult to cut the conference      because of budget difficulty.''       Other circuits around the country have cancelled their      annual conferences, however. The New York-based Second      Circuit and Denver-based Tenth Circuit cancelled their 1993      meetings, and the St. Louis-based Eighth Circuit has      cancelled its 1994 conference. Four other circuits have gone      to biennial conferences.       A call to cancel future Ninth Circuit conferences was      defeated by a 5-3 vote of the circuit's executive committee      at its August meeting in Santa Barbara. Circuit Judge Charles      Wiggins, a former Republican congressman, warned colleagues      then that the cost could engender the wrong ``public      perception,'' especially in tight budget times.       Executive committee members voted to go ahead with the      circuit's 1994 conference in San Diego and its 1995      conference in Hawaii.       Exactly how much the Ninth Circuit or other circuits spend      on annual conferences is difficult to pinpoint, according to      circuit executives and a spokesman for the U.S.      Administrative Office of the Courts, which disburses money to      the federal bench. Judges submit conference expense vouchers      and reimbursement checks are issued in Washington. The Ninth      Circuit cost estimates were based on average airfare costs      calculated by circuit executives and the $250 maximum per day      charge judges and other government employees are allowed for      lodging and food.       Circuit conference expenses are subtracted from the      ``Salaries and Expenses'' line of the courts' budget.      Individual circuit expenses are never set forth in judicial      budget requests, said David Sellers, a spokesman for the      administrative office of the courts.       ``It doesn't get much more specific than that,'' Sellers      said.       New Jersey District Chief Judge John Gerry, who chairs the      Judicial Conference's executive committee, said the Ninth      Circuit's conference cost estimate was the first such      estimate he had ever heard. The executive committee, which      holds the Judicial Conference's purse strings, does not take      up or examine individual circuit expenditures, he said.       But the conference a year ago asked circuits to evaluate      the necessity of retreats and their costs. ``There hasn't      been any area of court operations we have not looked at to      save a buck here and there,'' Gerry said. His own circuit,      the Third, has gone to biennial conferences.                            a model circuit       Wallace said the work of the Ninth Circuit conference has      been recognized by other circuits. ``Some of us do a better      job than others in our efforts to improve the system,''      Wallace said. If efforts were not made to improve the      administration of justice, he added, costs of administering      the courts could be higher than they already are.       ``The budgeting problem is very complicated,'' Wallace      said. ``By singling out one aspect, the overall picture can      be blurred. We have thrashed this out. We have been      responsible.''       But some circuit judges like Wiggins have complained that      the conference is not as productive as Wallace or others may      think. ``We don't talk about much of interest to any of us;      our discussions are so broad,'' Wiggins told his colleagues      in Santa Barbara.       At the Santa Barbara meeting, conferees discussed      cooperation with the executive and legislative branches and,      in addition to passing a resolution calling for a task force      to study bias, passed one supporting adequate funding for the      courts.       Savings in conference costs would not have offset lack of      funds for jury trials or public defender programs because      those costs come out of different budget lines than the line      used to pay for conferences, said Wallace and court spokesman      Sellers.       This year's conference schedule, like those in the past,      included such diversions as tennis and golf tournaments, a      spouse sightseeing and winery tour and cooking and flower      arranging classes.       Wallace confirmed that the Ninth Circuit conference next      August will be held at the Loews Coronado Bay Resort on the      beach south of San Diego. The resorts offers bayside suites      and has three heated pools and a marina.
