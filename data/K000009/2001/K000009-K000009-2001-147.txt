Chairman, I want to compliment the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Brown) for taking leadership on this important issue of antimicrobial research.  Mr. Chairman, it has been amazing to me among families and friends, staff members and their families back home, how many individuals go into a hospital and are the victims of an infection. In spite of some of the best knowledge we have with modern medicine, yet we find that there is this antimicrobial resistance that in some ways is as a result of the technologies that we brought on board in the 20th century.  As we now embark on the 21st century, this research to add funding to help to expedite the action plan to combat antimicrobial resistance is essential. We know that life transforms and that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. I am sure that is the case, that scientists note every day, whether we are talking about HIV-AIDS or whether we are talking about some type of staphylococcus infection which becomes resistant to antibiotics which have been brought on board in years past.  We need to know which drugs are being affected most; how, when and why antibiotic drugs are being prescribed. We must educate physicians and the public on the proper use of antibiotics. I have been amazed at people who have taken antibiotics and find their systems having to readjust anywhere from 6 months to a year.  Mr. Chairman, I want to compliment the gentleman. The amendment would simply authorize funding for priorities already set by the health agencies of this government. I urge my colleagues for a ``yes'' vote on this important amendment on antimicrobial research. It provides $5 million to the FDA to expedite the carrying out of priority action items designated under an adopted action plan.                              {time}  1700
