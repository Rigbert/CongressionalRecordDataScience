Specifically, my amendment would give wind power--a limitless and clean energy source--a level playing field with solar, geothermal energy, which are in current law, and fuel cell energy, which is included in the underlying tax title. All of these renewable energies are eligible for a 10 percent business investment credit under section 48 of the tax code. And I think we should give people who wish to tap into wind energy the same credit. With my amendment, farmers, ranchers and other business owners who wish to install a small wind energy system up to 75 kilowatts can do so, and get a credit on their tax return worth 10 percent of the cost of installing the wind system. I applaud the work of Senators Baucus and Grassley, as well as the rest of the Finance Committee, which put together a package of energy tax incentives. I am hopeful that the small wind system amendment that I have filed will be accepted as part of the tax incentive package. I know Senators Baucus and Grassley are working diligently to make this happen in the near future.  However, in the event that the Finance Committee and bill managers do not succeed in working something out on this provision, I am calling up this amendment so that it may be considered by the Senate at the appropriate time. This amendment makes small changes to the underlying tax title, so that farmers, ranchers, and small business owners will be eligible for a tax incentive when they choose to install a wind energy system on their property. This amendment would have an effect similar to adding wind to section 48 of the tax code, where solar, geothermal, and now fuel cell energy already receive a business investment credit.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be laid aside.
