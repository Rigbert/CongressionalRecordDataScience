 President, I ask unanimous consent that upon receipt of H.R. 1222, if the text is the same as S. 94, H.R. 1222 be considered read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; further, that with respect to S. 94, passage be vitiated and the bill be indefinitely postponed.
