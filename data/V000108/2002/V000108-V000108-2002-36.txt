Speaker, it is my distinct honor to commend one of Northwest Indiana's most distinguished citizens, Wally Laird, of Rensselaer, Indiana. On Friday, September 27, 2002, he will be honored for his exemplary and dedicated service to our community. Wally's praiseworthy efforts will be recognized at a special Rensselaer/Remington Area Chamber of Commerce dinner, as an endowment for a scholarship has been established in his name.  The scholarship, the Wally Laird Youth Service Award, was created to honor a high school student who shows similar qualities to Mr. Laird. These qualities include dedication to community causes and commitment to education, as well as possessing the willingness to share the knowledge he or she gains with others. This banquet and scholarship is in honor of Wally Laird's service as well as his demonstrated commitment to improving the communities of Northwest Indiana.  Wally Laird, a longtime resident of Rensselaer, graduated from Rensselaer High School in 1950 and went on to Purdue University to earn his bachelor's and master's degrees in agricultural economics. A local farmer and entrepreneur, Wally Laird is most widely known by radio-listeners as the host of WRIN/WLGI's ``Farm World.'' Aside from farming and his radio work, Wally is an active Rotarian and gives much of his time to the Carnegie Players theater group. Additionally, he has been working, with others in the agricultural community to bring an ethanol-producing facility to Jasper County, Indiana.  The featured speaker at this dinner will be WGN Radio personality Max Armstrong. Armstrong is one of America's best-known and widely followed agriculture journalists. His daily broadcasts, with colleague Orion Samuelson. have been heard by millions of Americans across the United States for nearly 25 years. Armstrong has spent the past two decades delivering the news about agriculture to his vast farming audience, as well as the non-farm consumers in the Chicago area. Armstrong has been the recipient of numerous awards of excellence in journalism.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me commending Wally Laird for his outstanding service to Rensselaer and neighboring Northwest Indiana communities. His family and friends should be proud of his efforts, as his leadership has served as a beacon of hope throughout the area. Wally Laird's longstanding commitment to improving the quality of life for the people of Northwest Indiana is truly inspirational and should be recognized and commended.                          ____________________
