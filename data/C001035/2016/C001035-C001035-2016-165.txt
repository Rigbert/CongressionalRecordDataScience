President, at its 214th commencement on May 14, 2016, the University of Maine at Orono will award an honorary doctorate degree to Leonard Minsky of Bangor. Today I wish to congratulate my dear friend for this recognition and to join people throughout Maine in thanking him for his uncommon generosity, vision, and dedication that have made our university's flagship campus a center for the arts and humanities.    A member of the class of 1950, Leonard received an outstanding education at UMaine and has never stopped giving back. His passion for the arts and commitment to the highest expressions of human ideals are evident throughout the beautiful Orono campus. Minsky Recital Hall in the school of performing arts is a marvelous place for students, faculty, and world-class visiting artists to perform. In recent years, I have had the pleasure of hearing the University Singers, which included my niece, perform there.  The Minsky Gallery in the Maine Center for the Arts celebrates the visual arts around the world. The Minsky Culture Lab at the Hudson Museum offers interactive, hands-on experiences for Maine schoolchildren and UMaine students. With Leonard's support, the UMaine Museum of Art in downtown Bangor features the best in modern andcontemporary art, from Andrew Wyeth to Andy Warhol.  Leonard's partner in these endeavors is his partner in life, his extraordinary wife, Renee. Leonard's service has included leadership roles on the university's development council, the Campaign for Maine, and the UMaine Board of Visitors. Renee, one of the first volunteer docents at the Hudson Museum, has held leadership roles on advisory boards for both the Hudson Museum and the Maine Center for the Arts. Both have been active Patrons of the Arts, the UMaine program that supports tours by university performing arts ensembles and that encourages student involvement in the arts through outreach to elementary and secondary schools across Maine.  The university's Fogler Library, Maine's largest research library, is home to the Minsky Jewish Heritage Collection. This priceless cultural and historical resource is a gift from Renee and Leonard Minsky, along with his brother, Norman.  For several years, I had the good fortune to live just across the street in Bangor from Renee and Leonard Minsky. They were wonderful neighbors. Since that time, I have been blessed with their friendship and inspired by their leadership.  Students, faculty, and visitors to the UMaine campus cannot help but feel similarly blessed and inspired. The energy and excitement of the University of Maine's arts and humanities community that Leonard Minsky has helped to create enriches our State today and will do so for generations to come.                          ____________________
