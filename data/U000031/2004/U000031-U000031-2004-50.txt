Speaker, I regret to inform the House that during the October break, a great American, the Reverend Doctor Bobby Joe Tolbert passed away. His memorial service was held October 12th at the Bethel Baptist Church in Three Rivers, Michigan.  Rev. Tolbert was a strong man of faith and he was a pillar of strength in St. Joe County. He was respected by all and made a difference for thousands--whether it was thru his service on the school board, pulpit, business board member, Dad, and husband. All that knew him miss him but know he is now praying for us.  I ask that the Celebration of Life obituary be printed in the Record.                         A Celebration of Life       Dr. Bobby Joe Tolbert was the fourteenth child born to the      union of Woodie and Jatie Tolbert in Montevello, Alabama. He      was preceded in death by both parents and nine siblings;      Woodie, Jr., Madelyn McComb, Andrew Tolbert, William Tolbert,      Lonnie Tolbert, Rosie Bell Tolbert, Georgia Harris, Lois      Mays, and Earlene Williams. Dr. Tolbert received his early      education and confessed his faith and hope in God in      Montevello.       As a young man, Dr. Tolbert moved to Chicago, Illinois      where he played professional baseball in the Negro American      League. From there he entered the White Sox Organization,      playing in the Minor Leagues for the Kansas City Monarchs.       He attended Cortez Peters Business College where he met his      loving and devoted wife. This union was blessed with two sons      Darryl Wayne and Reginald Fitzgerald. Under the mentoring of      his father-in-law, Reverend F.L. Porter, Sr., he received his      call to the ministry--thereby moving from the ball team to      ``God's Team.''       Desiring to prepare for the ministry, he matriculated to      Chicago Baptist Institute, De Paul University and he received      an Honorary Doctor of Divinity Degree from Tennessee School      of Religion, Memphis, Tennessee.       Dr. Tolbert was called to the pastorship of Bethel Baptist      Church in Three Rivers, Michigan over thirty-six years ago,      where he served as a steadfast and devout leader of God's      people until he went home to be with the Lord. Under his      charge, they built a new church edifice; he developed and      built a Recreation and Learning Center; and he set up a      College Scholarship Program for underprivileged students. In      addition to all of Dr. Tolbert's spiritual endeavors, he made      a lasting impact on the whole city of Three Rivers.       His civic activities over the years of dedicated service      include: Three Rivers Community Chest Board, St. Joseph      County Mental Health Board, President of Three Rivers      Ministerial Association, Sixteen years as President of the      Three Rivers Branch NAACP, Sixteen years on the Three Rivers      Hospital Authority Board, Kalamazoo/St. Joseph County Private      Industry Council (five years), Three Rivers Community School      Board of Education (five years), two of those years as      President.       Dr. Tolbert participated in the organization and      implementation of the Biddy Basketball program (now called      Junior Pro), and Fraternal Order of Police Baseball Program      which he coached for five years. As a member of the Civitan      Service Club, he helped organize the first youth chapter of      Civitan.       Dr. Tolbert served on the Three Rivers School Board      Committee for the building of Three Rivers Middle School, and      many other advisory committees. Pastor Tolbert has supported      the total community, all while serving his people in the      Pastoral Ministry position.       Dr. Tolbert's life work centered on his deep commitment to      do God's will as a spiritual leader, his family and his      community. He was a man of faith, integrity, and deep      conviction. The legacy he has left will be a guiding force      for countless numbers. His memory, the lessons he taught and      the love he shared is motivation for us to continue to carry      the torch and make this world a better place.       He leaves to cherish his memory and celebrate his life: his      beloved wife of forty-five years--Henri'Etta; two sons--     Darryl Wayne (Connie) of Flint, Michigan and Reginald     Fitzgerald (Victoria) of Jacksonville, Florida; six      grandchildren--Wayne Tolbert, Daniel Tolbert, and Dylan      Tolbert of Three Rivers, Michigan and Jessica Tolbert,      Brittany Marie Tolbert, and Joshua Tolbert of Jacksonville,      Florida; four sisters--Mary Ella Bender of Montgomery,      Alabama, Ethel Crenshaw (John) of Chicago, Illinois, Helen      Tinker of Chereville, Indiana, and Wilma Abrams (Walter) of      North Chicago, Illinois; a host of nieces and nephews; a very      special friend, Dr. Leroy Shelton; adopted parents, Dr. W.G.      and Mary Terry; his wonderful and loving Bethel Church      Family; and a countless number of friends.                          ____________________
