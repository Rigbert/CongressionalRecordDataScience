President, I rise today to recognize the accomplishments of an outstanding group ofyoung people from Massabesic High School in Waterboro, ME. This group of 20 students represented Maine in the national finals of ``We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution'' in Washington, DC, May 4-6, 2002. The students from Massabesic High School demonstrated teamwork and dedication to reach this milestone and represented Maine ably and with determination. During the competition, students from 50 classrooms across the country put their skills to the test demonstrating their understanding of the values and ideas embodied in American constitutional government.  I would like to recognize the participating students, Allie Auger, Kirsten Benham, John Blow, Selina Carter, Alyssa Daniels, Scott Doyle, Brian Dupee, Kaleigh Gerity, Tucker Gilman, Matt Kimball, Matt Krueger, Aaron Libby, Eric Matheson, Bri Morin, Glen Petrarca, Meghan Roubo, Joe Rousseau, Jason Roy, Courtney Strout, and Dawn Theriault for their persistence, dedication, and drive. I also stand to recognize the dedication and work of their teacher, Joseph Wagner, the district coordinator, David Ezhaya, and the state coordinator, Julia Underwood.  I am very proud to recognize the efforts and accomplishments of this exceptional group of students from Maine and bring their achievement to the attention of the Senate.                          ____________________
