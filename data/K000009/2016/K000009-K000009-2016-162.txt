Speaker, as Catholics worldwide celebrate the feast of St. Nicholas today, the life of Father Paul Kwiatkowski will be celebrated in a Funeral Mass at Queen of the Most Holy Rosary Cathedral in Toledo, Ohio. With eternally grateful hearts but deepest sadness at his passing, thousands of citizens across our community mourn the passing of Fr. Paul, a loving, gentle, and kind apostle of Christ. Fr. Paul was beloved by all who knew him. And we know him through his works. As our perceptive Aunt Esther would observe: ``Now, that was a priest!''  How many of us hold unforgettable memories of Fr. Paul's selfless service and abiding kindness, always in the heart of our community. His steady and faith filled journey among us imbued the word ``faith'' with real meaning. A favorite memory for me is the beautiful, annual Memorial Day Mass with appropriate observances at Mt. Carmel Cemetery for veterans and their families, at which he would officiate. A gifted musician, many times he would play his violin under the budding trees as his cassock blew gently in the spring winds. There was a sense of peace and connectedness to the awesome power of creation he brought to every occasion. A hospitable lunch always followed at the former Polish American Veterans Association Post on Lagrange Street. I too recall the moving Polish Mass at the former St. Hedwig's before the Polish Festival opened, as the church doors swung wide and the congregants filled the sidewalks. To Toledo's Polonia, those of Polish-American heritage, he was a revered touchstone and valued counselor. I similarly treasure the memories of the Central American garment workers he hosted at St. James Catholic Church, a reminder of the work that remains to be done on worker exploitation across our hemisphere. Fr. Paul's service always managed to meet the suffering edge of humanity. And his spirit gave strength to others.  Fr. Paul was a learned man, but he possessed a rare gift for communicating with people of all persuasions. He was an educator and Latin teacher as well as a fine musician, and people naturally drew to him. His wonderful sense of humor and twinkling eyes had their own way of communicating ``you are welcome.'' He dedicated his life to ministering to congregations in the heart of our city, always including some of the poorest precincts in Toledo. His rare leadership and tutelage of the Lagrange Stickney and Broadway neighborhoods sparked and immeasurably contributed to the neighborhoods' ongoing revitalization. His work at St. James and Immaculate Conception Catholic parishes made newcomers feel welcome. He consistently engaged with the people of the broader neighborhood, extending beyond the walls of the churches he pastored. Fr. Paul defined evangelization by embracing community.  I cannot even imagine nor count the number of individuals he counseled and comforted over a half century of his service. I do know our Toledo community remains grateful forever that he gave his life for us. He was a people's priest, a diocesan priest. He lived his vows.  May the angels lift him high, ushering him to paradise where there will always be music, joy and peace.                          ____________________
