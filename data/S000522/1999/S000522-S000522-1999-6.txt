Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman) the chairman of the full committee and the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos) for their eloquent remarks today.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of H. Con. Res. 206. This resolution addresses an issue of utmost urgency, the war in Chechnya and the plight of innocent people caught in the Russian military onslaught. In August and September of this year, Islamic extremists based in Chechnya, independent of the government of Chechnya, twice staged armed incursions into the neighboring Russian Federation Republic of Dagestan with the intent of creating a separate political entity within Dagestan.  In response, the Russian government has sent its army to reoccupy Chechnya, an area that had won de facto independence from Russia as a result of a very bloody war from 1994 to 1996. The Russian government is justified in rebuffing armed aggression against its territorial integrity. Moreover, one can certainly sympathize with Russia's frustration when unsolved bombings kill almost 300 persons in Russia.  But this does not justify reactivating a war against a civilian population in Chechnya. Several news reports have, in detail, described the air raids and the artillery shelling of noncombatant villages, homes, and farms. The November 6 edition of the Guardian, for example, in Great Britain said, and I quote, missiles smash into a crowded marketplace, killing and maiming hundreds. A tank shell explodes among a group of village boys playing football; seven die, others lose legs or eyes. Orphans of an earlier war shake and sob with terror as warplanes on bombing runs boom low over their outdoor camp.  Mr. Speaker, the death toll is in the hundreds, perhaps thousands, and the number of internally displaced persons is now put at around 200,000. This figure, of course, does not include those persons trapped in the besieged Chechen capital of Grozny. Many of these are elderly ethnic Russians with absolutely nowhere to flee. The government of Chechnya has not been entirely blameless as my friend from California pointed out earlier in this situation. Since achieving de facto independence from Russia in 1994, Chechnya has degenerated into a morass of lawlessness and violence with a government powerless to establish law and order and an economy unable to recover from the devastation of war.  Mr. Speaker, specifically H. Con. Res. 206 urges the government of the Russian Federation and all parties to cease the indiscriminate use of force against the civilian population in Chechnya. The government of Russia and all parties are urged to enter into negotiations and to avail themselves to the capabilities of the OSCE which helped broker the end of the war in 1996.  Additionally, this resolution calls upon Chechen authorities to make every effort to deny bases to radical elements committed to violent actions in the North Caucasus and urges Chechen authorities to create a rule of law environment with legal norms based on internationally accepted standards.  Finally, H. Con. Res. 206 calls upon our own government to express to all parties the necessity of resolving the conflict peacefully and to express the willingness of the U.S. to extend appropriate assistance toward such resolution, including humanitarian assistance as needed.  Mr. Speaker, I commend to the reading of my colleague an excellent article in the Wall Street Journal, an op-ed piece by Zbigniew Brzenski who, as we all know, was National Security Advisor and a very prominent and insightfull leader is in international affairs. He points out that unlike the earlier war, this time the Russians have no intention of engaging in costly street fighting against the entrenched and determined Chechens.  Instead, their plan is to use new weapons to launch devastating attacks from a safe distance. Using a combination of explosives and chemical agents,they will aim to wipe out the thousands of Chechen fighters squeezed by Russian pressure into compressed urban ruins. There have been reports that gas masks have already been distributed to the Russian troops. Among the new weapons will be so-called fuel air explosives which blanket targeted terrain with a flammable vapor cover and following a massive explosion precipitate a lethal vacuum. Even deeply dug-in Chechens will be exterminated.  The cumulative result of this tragedy will be the killing of most fighting-age Chechen males. Mr. Brzenski goes on to state and I quote, so far the Clinton administration has been callously passive while international reaction has been muted even though a Russian success in the war would have wide and negative consequences. Then he goes on to further develop that case.  Mr. Speaker, I want to emphasize that this resolution is not anti-Russian or pro-Chechen. Many observers who wish to see a prosperous and democratic Russia have been deeply disturbed by the present campaign in Chechnya. Recently, the chairperson of the Moscow Helsinki Group, Ludmilla Alexeeva, and Dr. Elena Bonner and several other prominent human rights activists in Russia issued an appeal in which they condemned the Russian government for having chosen full scale war in Chechnya as the means to fight terrorism.                              {time}  1530  The appeal states, and I quote, ``We believe that authorities' actions will not solve the problem in Chechnya. The most that they will accomplish will be a long-term occupation of Chechnya which will deform Russian democratic institutions and will once and for all transform Russia into a police state,'' close quote.  Mr. Speaker, last week the State Department accused Moscow of failing to meet human rights standards set out in both the Geneva Conventions and the codes of conduct of the OSCE, a very welcome statement on behalf of our government. Unfortunately, when Attorney General Janet Reno visited Moscow last month, her evasive comments about the war in Chechnya prompted the October 23, 1999, edition of the Moscow Times to conclude that, and I quote, ``Reno's Quiet Gave War a Green Light.'' Hopefully, the administration will continue, as it has begun now, to speak with one voice in the future and to avoid any such mixed messages.  Meanwhile, Mr. Speaker, criticism of Russia's actions in Chechnya is mounting throughout the world. From the European Union and the Council of Europe to the United Kingdom, Germany and Canada; the government of Bahrain is reportedly taking steps to have the humanitarian situation in Chechnya considered by the U.N. Security Council. The proposal to win IMF funding for Russia while it continues its bloody outrage in Chechnya is an excellent idea, and I would hope that the Congress would consider it when the next session opens in January.  Finally, in an editorial entitled ``No Funds for Russia's War,'' this past Sunday, the Washington Post called for an end to IMF funding for Russia and wrote, and I quote: ``Few would oppose a Russian campaign to eliminate terrorism, the stated purpose of the military campaign. But Russia's violence against Chechen civilians has become so indiscriminate and massive that no one can take seriously any longer the official justifications. Just on Friday, a Russian prime minister flatly stated that ``Chechnya's capital will be destroyed.''  I urge support for the resolution.
