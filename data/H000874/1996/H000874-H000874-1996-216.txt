Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I asked a question; let me answer the question. Of the money, discretionary money, that we spend on education--which is, as the gentleman points out, a relatively small percentage of the total amount spent on education in this country, 2 percent--2 percent, is administrative cost. Two percent is administrative cost, I tell my friend.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. Of course, one could say we will put $20 million more in title I. We ought to put $20 million more in title I. We ought to put $100 million more in title I, I tell my friend from Florida, but we are not doing it because the 602(b)s have been squeezed very badly. Why? Because the Republican tax cut was deemed to be essential in a time when we are trying to balance the budget and serve our children.  I tell my friend, that 2 percent--2 percent--is administrative cost for the administration of the 98 percent of discretionary funds which is sent either to students or to schools and local school districts. Two percent.  All the gentleman wants to do is, as he frankly likes to do on a regular basis, attack the bureaucrats. These are real people doing important things, trying to make programs that this Congress adopts work. I frankly am fed up, I tell my friend, fed up with people rising on this floor and using ``bureaucrat'' as an epithet, as a slur, as an effort to dehumanize people that we have employed to try to carry out the policies and programs that we adopt.  Good people have to spend time every day trying to make sure that these policies and programs will work for Americans, for children, for families. ``Bureaucrat''--it is said with a snide smile sometimes, demagoguing for the people back home. I am fed up with it.  Yes, I represent a lot of Federal employees, and I am proud of it. They work hard and they do a good job, and I dare every one of you to ask the people who come from the private sector, from corporations, from businesses, large and small, ask them what they think of the quality of the morale and of the product of those people who work in Washington and around the country.  By the way, Mr. Chairman, only 20 percent work in Washington. The rest work in Florida, in California, in New York, in Texas, in Iowa, in Illinois, in every State in the Nation, trying to deliver the services that this Congress and the President--in previous administrations and in this one--decided were appropriate for the American public.                              {time}  1530  Two percent, I tell my friend from Florida, 2 percent overhead in education and 92 percent to the recipients, either students or local school districts or States, to deliver education to the students of this country to make us more competitive.  I am tired of this demagoguery. You can disagree with the programs, but we ought to stop demeaning the people that we have hired, because there are some demented souls in America who hear that debate and decide that they can go to the office building in Oklahoma City, angry at their government, angry at the policies of their government, and in a demented, deranged, sick manifestation of that sentiment, attack the people, persons, the individuals that we ask to carry out the responsibilities given to them by the Congress and the President of the United States.  I hope, Mr. Chairman, that this amendment is defeated. If the gentleman wants to put $20 million additional in title I, I will support it because it needs $20 million more. But to cut Federal employees further in the process when we are already reducing 272,000 plus probably another 50,000 or 100,000, I say to my friend, is wrong.
