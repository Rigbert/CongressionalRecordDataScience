 President, I rise to discuss the Eastside Light Rail Transit, LRT project in Los Angeles, which would receive $5,000,000 in New Starts funds contained in this appropriations bill. This six-mile, dual track light rail system will originate at Union Station in downtown Los Angeles, where it connects with the newly opened Pasadena Gold Line, and will travel east to Atlantic Boulevard. It will bridge State Route 101 Freeway and traverse the existing 1st Street Bridge over the Los Angeles River, then under the communities of East LA and Boyle Heights and return to the surface near the intersection of 1st and Lorena Streets.  The Eastside LRT project is the top fiscal year 2004 appropriations priority of the Los Angeles County MTA.  I understand that the administration's fiscal year 2004 budget includes $55,000,000 for the Eastside LRT project and it also states that the project is pending receipt of a Full Funding Grant Agreement, FFGA.
