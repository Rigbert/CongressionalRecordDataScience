Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge my colleagues to defeat this rule. This bill that the Republicans are bringing to this floor breaks the budget deal the Republicans made with the President. On issue after issue this bill is in violation of the budget agreement.  Mr. Speaker, how can the President negotiate if they will not deal in good faith, if they will not keep their word? On children's health care, this bill breaks the deal. On protecting disabled legal immigrants, the bill breaks the deal. On providing worker protection for people moving from welfare to work, this bill is not in keeping with the spirit of the deal.  Mr. Speaker, this bill violates both the spirit and the letter of a balanced budget agreement. Defeat the rule, defeat the bill. It is not the deal made with the President. It is not the deal made with the American people.
