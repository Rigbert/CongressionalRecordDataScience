Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Lieutenant Colonel Maren Calvert, who has worked in my office for the past year as a Defense Fellow. Lt. Col. Calvert started in my office last January and she has truly been a pleasure to have on the staff. Her law background coupled with her military experience has benefited the office tremendously. She offers a unique perspective, is always prepared, takes on any task and does it with a smile.  Lt. Col. Calvert is a Category A reservist and came to my office from the 701st Combat Operations Squadron (COS) detachment 1 at Hickam Air Force Base in Hawai'i where she served as the Deputy Commander. The 701 COS operates out of March Air Reserve Base, California which is located in my congressional district. The 701 COS provides trained, experienced Air Operations Center (AOC) warfighters primarily in support of 7th Air Force, the Combined AOC, and Commander of Air Force Forces at Osan Air Base, Republic of Korea. In her capacity as Deputy Commander, Lt. Col. Calvert provided expertise within the Operations, Plans and Strategy Divisions on the Law of Armed Conflict and Rules of Engagement. She advised the Commander on all legal issues, including military justice and civil law.  Lt. Col. Calvert was commissioned in 1993 from the Air Force Academy where she graduated with a Bachelors of Science degree in Humanities. She served on active duty through August 1998 and then obtained her law degree from the University of California, Los Angeles before joining the Air Force Reserve. In addition to her 701 COS assignment, Lt. Col. Calvert has served as the Chief of Health Services, 701 COS; Commander, Business Operations & Beneficiary Services, TRICARE, and Resource Management Flights; and as Squadron Section Commander. Lt. Col. Calvert has furthered her Air Force education, having completed the Squadron Officer School, Air Command and Staff College, and the Judge Advocate General Staff Office Course at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama.  As a civilian, Lt. Col. Calvert is a commercial litigation attorney at Alston Hunt Floyd & Ing in Honolulu, HI. Her practice is diversified, with experience in condominium law, real estate development, foreclosures, adversary proceedings in bankruptcy, and an emphasis in health law and health care compliance. She is admitted to both the California and Hawai'i Bar.  During her time in the office she has focused her efforts on defense acquisition, TRICARE, basing issues, wildfire resource issues, Medicaid portability for military members with autistic children, and many other policy areas. She has been an invaluable resource to all my staff and I would also like to take this opportunity to thank her and her family--I know it was not easy to move across an ocean and a country to start a new life. To Jason, Braedon, and Teryn, thank you for supporting your wife and mom, she is an impressive lady. On behalf of everyone in the office, I would like to extend a heartfelt ``Mahalo'' to Lt. Col. Calvert for all her hard work and let her know that my office door is always open for Pau Hana!                          ____________________
