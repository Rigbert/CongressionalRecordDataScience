 President, today I honor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, who is retiring at the end of 2008, after a distinguished and illustrious career spanning 50 years as apublic servant in the State of California.  I wish to extend to Mrs. Burke, who served as a Representative of California's 37th Congressional District from 1973 to 1979, my sincere congratulations for the decades of dedicated service that she has given to her Nation, her State, and her county.  She is currently serving as chair of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors and is in the final year of her fourth term on the board.  For the past 15 years, she has represented the Second Supervisorial District.  Supervisor Burke will be remembered as a devoted public servant who amassed numerous accomplishments and countless awards--in addition to inspiring women and minorities to pursue careers in public service.  As a product of the Los Angeles Unified School District, Mrs. Burke developed an interest in public speaking and participated in several citywide competitions during her high school years.  Her involvement in these events and many extracurricular activities helped her to obtain scholarships to the UC Berkeley and later at UCLA.  In 1956, Mrs. Burke received a law degree from the University of Southern California School of Law.  It was difficult for women, particularly African Americans, to practice law, because many private law firms showed little interest in hiring women as attorneys.  So Mrs. Burke opened her own law office in Los Angeles.  She specialized in immigration and civil rights and fought segregation in real estate law.  Mrs. Burke was active in the civil rights movement with memberships in various local and national organizations.  She subsequently landed a staff attorney position on the McCone Commission, which investigated the causes of the 1965 Watts riots in Los Angeles.  She became a spokesperson for the underrepresented and, through a grassroots campaign, won her first political office in 1966 as a California State assemblywoman.  It was a position she held for the next 6 years.  In 1972, Mrs. Burke became the first African American woman--west of the Mississippi River--to be elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.  She was selected to serve as vice chair of the 1972 Democratic National Convention in Miami and later on the House Select Committee on Assassinations.  She also was the first Congresswoman to give birth while in office.  Mrs. Burke did not seek re-election to Congress in 1978 but instead ran for attorney general of California.  She won the Democratic nomination, but subsequently was defeated in the general election.  In 1979, Mrs. Burke was appointed by the Governor of California to fill a vacancy in the Fourth Supervisorial District in Los Angeles County and served in that capacity until the end of 1980.  She also was appointed by the Governor to serve on the Board of Regents of the University of California in 1982.  Two years later, Mrs. Burke was selected to serve as vice chair of the 1984 U.S. Olympics Organizing Committee.  In 1992, she became the first African American elected to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors.  She played a significant role in the 2000 Democratic National Convention, hosting an event for hundreds of African American elected officials nationwide.  Supervisor Burke represents nearly 2.5 million residents in the Second District of the Nation's largest county.  Her efforts primarily have focused on improving the lives of children, encouraging economic development, and improving transportation throughout Los Angeles, as well as promoting public social services, health care for the uninsured, and affirmative action for women and the economically disadvantaged.  In addition, she has taken the lead in establishing a county archives system.  These are just some of Yvonne Brathwaite Burke's significant accomplishments.  On behalf of the U.S. Senate and the State of California, I extend my heartfelt gratitude for her immeasurable contributions throughout her renowned career.  With sincere best wishes, I congratulate Supervisor Burke upon her retirement from elective office.  And I am pleased to join her many coworkers; her family: her husband William, her daughter Autumn and stepdaughter Christine; friends; and associates in wishing her health, happiness, and continued good fortune in her future endeavors.                          ____________________
