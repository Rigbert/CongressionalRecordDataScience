 Chairman, I want to applaud my colleague for his statement. I think there is something fundamentally wrong with the priorities of this country when we have men and women who have put their lives on the line, who in Vermont and all over this country are on waiting lists, people who served this country and who are thrown off of VA health care.  When we talk about giving huge tax breaks to people who do not need it and then say that we do not have $1.8 billion for our veterans, that is absolutely outrageous. And I want to commend my friend for his efforts.
