Chairman, previously on another amendment, the Solomon amendment, I raised the issue with respect to these, quote, ``made known'' amendments. Members are offering these made known amendments so that they comply with the rules. It is understandable.  In this case I strongly agree with the gentlewoman from Ohio [Ms. Kaptur], as she knows, and I have been very concerned about the practices of countries around the world, and specifically, of course, the People's Republic of China.  However, the reason I reserved the point of order is to again make the point to the Members of the House to look at the language of this made known amendment: None of the funds made available in this act for the U.S. Custom Service may be used to make, issue, prescribe, take, implement, administer or enforce any determination, finding, rule, order, policy or other action relating to trade relations between the United States and the People's Republic of China when it is made known to the Federal official.  Now, here we do not even know which Federal official it is.  When it is made known to the Federal official having authority to obligate or expend such funds that such determination, finding, rule, order policy or other action has the effect of allowing imports into the United States of products of the People's Republic of China that were mined, produced or manufactured with the use of prison slave or child labor.  I agree with that sentiment.                              {time}  1445  But let me suggest to the Members what it requires the Federal officials to do. The Federal official, first of all, has to make a determination--was it manufactured, mined, produced with prison, slave, or child labor? So the Federal official must do that, presumably, unless he simply or she simply takes at face value the representation of anybody, because the made-known amendments do not specify who it is, of anybody who calls up and says to that Federal official: Hey, guess what, your rule, regulation, or policy has the effect of accepting goods from China which are produced by slave or child labor.  There is a problem with these made-known amendments. Is the Federal official to simply take that at face value no matter who picks up the phone and calls or writes? A competitor? Somebody who wants to undermine trade? Somebody who wants to attack the importer? Somebody who wants to attack the exporter in China? Who knows what the motivation might be of the party making known.  I urge the Chair, I urge those making this determination to carefully consider the premise underlying the making in order of these amendments. I would say to the chairman, who is a distinguished member of the Committee on Rules and a leader on his side of the aisle and in this House on rules changes, that we need to carefully review what we are generating in this House, not as it relates to the substance of either the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Ohio [Ms. Kaptur] or the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon], but in terms of what we are getting ourselves into in terms of a policy of telling to our Federal officials who are responsible for carrying out their duties and responsibilities. We are suggesting if somebody calls you up and makes it known to you, you cannot spend any money and you cannot pursue the objectives.  I suggest that makes no sense. Therefore, I again respectfully suggest that the underlying rationale of the sustaining of this kind of amendment as consistent with the rules ought to be overturned.
