Mr. Chairman, this week the Congress spoke its mind on the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and we did so clearly and forcefully, just as the Senate did last week. By an overwhelming majority, we supported the right of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina to defend themselves.  The Congress, however, is not the only voice expressing outrage over the toleration of aggression and genocide. On Monday, 27 nongovernmental organizations released a joint statement on Bosnia. It is a powerful statement which I request be inserted into the Record, and which I commend to my colleagues. Let me quote from it:       Bosnia is not a faraway land of no concern to our      ``national interest.'' At stake is the global commitment to      fundamental human values--the right not to be killed because      of one's religion or ethnic heritage, and the right of      civilians not to be targeted by combatants. The time has come      for multilateral military action to end the massacre of      innocent civilians in Bosnia. Nothing else has worked. Force      must be used to stop genocide, not simply to retreat from it.      American leadership, in particular, is required.  These words, Mr. Speaker, come from a variety of American organizations. They include religious organizations, those dedicated to humanitarian causes, including the care of refugees; and groups dedicated to the rule of law. These are not organizations which one would assume support military options; the fact that they do says something about the gravity of what is happening in Bosnia. Moreover, some are Arab-American organizations, and some are Jewish-American organizations. The list represents a broad spectrum.  Another statement on Bosnia has also been released recently--the letter of resignation by the U.N.'s rapporteur on human rights in the former Yugoslavia, former Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki. Mr. Mazowiecki is known as a thoughtful and principled man; his dedication to human rights is evident as much in his resignation as it was in his acceptance of this position 3 years ago. I would like to submit that statement for the Record as well, Mr. Speaker, and let me quote a few lines from it:       One cannot speak about the protection of human rights with      credibility when one is confronted with the lack of      consistency and courage displayed by the international      community and its leaders. The reality of the human rights      situation today is illustrated by the tragedy of the people      of Srebrenica and Zepa. . . Crimes have been committed with      swiftness and brutality and by contrast the response of the      international community has been slow and ineffectual. . . I      would like to believe that the present moment will be a      turning point in the relationship between Europe and the      world toward Bosnia. The very stability of international      order and the principle of civilization is at stake over the      question of Bosnia. I am not convinced that the turning point      hoped for will happen and cannot continue to participate in      the pretense of the protection of human rights.  These words, Mr. Speaker, reflect the frustration of many of us who see the conflict in Bosnia for what it is, and know what needs to be done to stop it. This is not a civil war based on ancient hatreds. This is not simply about Bosnia. This conflict is about aggression and genocide, and we must beware the massage which the international community is sending should give to those around the world willing to use force to achieve their political ends.  In responding to crises and conflicts, we must remain objective, and attempt to see things as they really are, without bias. That means we must abandon an artificial neutrality. We must instead identify aggressor and stand with the victim of aggression. Just as these 27 nongovernmental organizations and Mr. Mazowiecki have taken that step, so must this Congress and this country, Mr. Speaker. We must take a stand. It's a matter of principle, and of lives.                    Joint Policy Statement on Bosnia       The international community's half-measures and evasions      have not ended three years of ethnic slaughter in Bosnia. It      is time for leadership and action. Bosnia is not a faraway      land of no concern to our ``national interest.'' At stake is      the global commitment to fundamental human values--the right      not to be killed because of one's religious or ethnic      heritage, and the right of civilians not to be targeted by      combatants.       The U.N. General Assembly, the U.N. Commission on Human      Rights, the World Conference on Human Rights, and the      International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia      have all decried the slaughter in Bosnia as genocide, one of      the most heinous crimes known to humanity. The international      community has a moral and legal duty to prevent genocide      (Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of      Genocide, Art. VIII) and to see that its instigators and      those responsible for parallel war crimes and crimes against      humanity are brought to justice.       The time has come for multilateral military action to end      the massacre of innocent civilians in Bosnia. Nothing else      has worked. Force must be used to stop genocide, not simply      to retreat from it. American leadership, in particular, is      required.       We represent 27 different human rights, humanitarian,      religious and professional organizations. So far, our      organizations have worked individually to end the atrocities      in Bosnia. Today, in an effort to end the paralysis, we join      together. We urgently call on President Clinton and the      leaders of the other major powers to take the following      steps:       Protect civilians in all ``safe areas.'' The major powers,      through their votes on the Security Council, established the      six ``safe areas'' in Bosnia. Tens of thousands of Bosnians,      many of whom had been driven from their homes elsewhere in      the country, entrusted their lives to the international      forces. Instead, in Srebrenica and Zepa, they have been      abandoned. The major powers' recent vow to retaliate      forcefully against Bosnian Serb forces if they advance on      Gorazde is not enough. It should be extended to all remaining      ``safe areas''--Bihac, Sarajevo and Tuzla, as well as      Gorazde--and triggered not only if troops advance on those      havens but also if their civilians are shelled. Any military      action by intervening troops should comply strictly with      international humanitarian law.       Insist on immediate access to all detainees from Srebrenica      and Zepa. Thousands of men who had taken refuge in Srebrenica      and Zepa have now been detained by Bosnian Serb forces or      face imminent detention. Reports of brutality in Srebrenica      demonstrate that these detainees face an all-too-real threat      of murder. To prevent further massive loss of life, the major      powers should insist that international humanitarian      organizations are given immediate access to all detainees and      demand that their safety and well-being are ensured.       Ensure the delivery of humanitarian supplies to civilians      in the ``safe areas.'' The major powers must ensure the      delivery of humanitarian supplies to the ``safe areas,'' if      necessary by employing military force in response to the      obstruction of those supplies. For instance, the major powers      should secure the passage of supplies to Sarajevo over the      Mt. Igman road and ensure the delivery of supplies by airdrop      to enclaves that are not accessible by land. Deployment of      the rapid reaction force on Mt. Igman has begun, but we      remain concerned by the major powers' continuing      unwillingness to insist on the right to deliver humanitarian      supplies in the absence of Bosnian Serb assent.       Stigmatize those who direct, assist and supply abusive      troops. The major powers should publicly name the senior      political and military leaders who are presiding over      atrocities. Details of their crimes should be made public and      provided to the International Criminal Tribunal for the      Former Yugoslavia. The major powers, and particularly the      U.S. government, should also disclose all available      information, including intelligence, that implicates Serbia      in supplying, assisting or directing Bosnian Serb troops. The      major powers should also strengthen the regime for monitoring      external support to Bosnian Serb forces.       Do not lift, suspend or weaken sanctions against Belgrade      until it cooperates fully with the investigation and      extradition of suspected and indicted war criminals. The      creation of the International Criminal Tribunal for the      Former Yugoslavia is an historic opportunity to demonstrate      that genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity cannot      be committed with impunity--a message that was reaffirmed      with last week's indictment of Bosnian Serb political and      military leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic. The      Tribunal promises justice for victims, deterrence against      further abuse, and a basis for eventual peace and      reconciliation by substituting individualized guilt for the      assumptions of collective ethnic guilt that now fuel the      conflict. In recognition of the need for the Serbian      government's active support to secure the presence of      defendants for trial, the U.S. government had insisted      throughout much of 1994 that sanctions against Belgrade would      not be eased until it cooperated in the investigation and      extradition of suspected and indicted war criminals. But to      date, Belgrade has blocked Tribunal investigators and done      nothing to secure custody of Bosnian Serbs under indictment.      We are deeply disturbed that the major powers are nonetheless      now offering Belgrade an opportunity to suspend sanctions in      return for political concessions that have nothing to do with      the Tribunal. That offer should be withdrawn, and Belgrade's      active cooperation with the Tribunal should be made a      prerequisite for any new suspension, lifting or easing of the      sanctions.

His Excellency Tan Sri Dato Musa Hitam,     Chairman of the Commission on Human Rights, Xuala Lumpur.       Dear Mr. Chairman: Events in recent weeks in Bosnia and      Herzegovina, and above all the fact that the United Nations      has allowed Srebrenica and Zepa to fall along with the      horrendous tragedy which has beset the population of those      ``safe havens'' guaranteed by international agreements,      oblige me to state that I do not see any possibility of      continuing the mandate or special rapporteur entrusted to me      by the commission on human rights.       On accepting the mandate which was given to me for the      first time in August 1992, I declared unequivocally that my      goal would not simply be writing reports but helping the      people themselves. The creation of ``safe havens'' was from      the very beginning a central recommendation in my reports.      The recent decisions of the London conference which accepted      the fall of Srebrenica and resigned itself to the fate of      Zepa are unacceptable to me. Those decisions did not create      the conditions necessary for the defense of all ``safe      havens''.       These events constitute a turning point in the development      of the situation in Bosnia. At one and the same time, we are      dealing with the struggle of a state, a member of the United      Nations, for its survival and multi-ethnic character, and      with the endeavour to protect principles of international      order. One cannot speak about the protection of human rights      with credibility when one is confronted with the lack of      consistency and courage displayed by the international      community and its leaders, the reality of the human rights      situation today is illustrated by the tragedy of the people      of Srebrenica and Zepa.       Human rights violations continue blatantly. There are      constant blockades of the delivery of humanitarian aid. The      civilian population is shelled remorsely and the ``blue      helmets'' and representatives of humanitarian organizations      are dying. Crimes have been committed with swiftness and      brutality and by contrast the response of the international      community has been slow and ineffectual.       The character of my mandate only allows me to further      describe crimes and violations of human rights. But the      present critical moment forces us to realize the true      character of those crimes and the responsibility of Europe      and the international community for their own helplessness in      addressing them. We have been fighting in Poland against a      totalitarian system with a vision for the Europe of tomorrow.      How can we believe in a Europe of tomorrow created by      children of people who are abandoned today?       I would like to believe that the present moment will be a      turning point in the relationship between Europe and the      world towards Bosnia. The very stability of International      order and the principle off civilisation is at stake over the      question of Bosnia. I am not convinced that the turning point      hoped for will happen and cannot continue to participate in      the pretense of the protection of human rights.       Mr. Chairman, please understand the motives behind my      decision and convey them to the members of the Commission on      Human Rights. I will submit my final eighteenth report based      on my recent mission to Tuzla to the commission in the near      future.       Please accept, Excellency, the assurances of my highest      consideration.     Tadeus, Mazowiecki,     Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the      territory of the former Yugoslavia.                               ____________________
