President, I am rising to submit a resolution making it absolutely clear that Congress, and only Congress, has the authority and responsibility to set the Federal debt limit. I should not even have to submit a resolution such as this, but I feel it is absolutely necessary.  Raising the Federal debt limit--the limit we place on government borrowing--as everybody knows, has been a hot topic around Washington. It is a key issue for the start of the 113th Congress. It is another case where if we could just maintain regular order, regular authority to address our problems, that is the best way for us to approach the task of getting our fiscal house in order.  I know there is a lot of dispute over what breaching the limit means. There is a lot of talk about that. It is clear a great deal of the public and our financial markets are extremely concerned about the Federal Government's ability to meet its financial obligations once we do hit the limit.  The President has asked for a very large increase in the debt ceiling, and some in the administration have called for no limit at all. Others of the administration and in the House are calling for Congress to give up its authority to set the debt limit--rather amazing--thus giving the executive branch unilateral authority to borrow. This is not a good idea.  If the Federal Government does not collect enough revenue to pay for all its spending obligations, it must borrow to make up the shortfall. Everybody knows that. We are borrowing now about 42 cents of every $1 we are obligated to spend.  This is clearly--I think everybody would agree on either side of the aisle and the public--an unsustainable situation which will only get worse if we do not begin meaningful discussions over our spending priorities, including--including--entitlement spending to strengthen and preserve those programs for future generations.  The national debt is growing. Everybody has seen that chart. It is about $16.4 trillion. The total public debt outstanding at the end of the third quarter just passed was $16.07 trillion. That is up from $15.86 trillion reported in June 2012. We are on the wrong path.  The Federal debt is now equivalent to at least 73 percent of the Nation's gross domestic product--nearly double the level as a percentage of GDP that we had back in 1990. That is not too long ago.  According to some measures, there has been a 60-percent increase in the debt limit since 2009. At the rate we are going, in a few short years we will be spending more to pay interest on the debt than we will on all discretionary programs outside of defense. Even defense now is going through a very difficult time with the sequester and has already been cut about one-half trillion dollars.  Let me just say that means no money for education. That means no money for agriculture. That means no money for the environment. That means no money for health care. It all goes to pay off interest on the debt.  The Federal debt is the accumulation of this borrowing, including all bills, notes, and bonds issued by the Department of the Treasury.  The current statutory debt limit is $16.394 trillion, which was established on January 28 of last year, 2012--about 1 year ago--under the procedures of the Budget Control Act of 2011.  According to the Department of the Treasury, as of December 31--just last month--total debt outstanding subject to the limit was only $25 million--million; it used to be a lot of money--below the current limit.  Once the amount of outstanding debt reaches the debt limit, the government can no longer issue additional debt to cover the cash shortfalls needed to fund government operations and meet legal obligations.  Similar to the power of the purse, Congress's powers over borrowing are firmly rooted in our constitutional traditions. The Founders understood the potential danger of permitting the executive branch to unilaterally incur new public debt. Article I of the Constitution empowers only--only--Congress ``to borrow money on the credit of the United States.''  The debt limit is the means by which Congress--Congress--exercises this critical legislative responsibility.  I can remember well that lesson, that lecture, if you will, from Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the institutional flame of the Senate, who would have repeated that Congress cannot give debt limit authority to the executive, should not, cannot. It is not constitutional.  To implement this congressional prerogative, the amount of money the Federal Government is allowed to borrow is subject to a specific statutory limit.  From time to time, Congress considers and adopts legislation to change this limit and has done so more than 100 times since the first modern debt limit was set way back in 1939, and we will do so again shortly. We have to.  So preserving this role and establishing the debt limit is vital to encourage deficit reduction and to uphold our constitutional tradition of legislative control over borrowing. Not only does the debt limit provide an essential check on executive borrowing, it provides public accountability--everybody is talking about transparency--for Congress's borrowing and debt management practices. We cannot duck that responsibility. We cannot pass this debt limit simply to the Executive and duck our responsibility and the public accountability.  In other words, debates over the debt limit, as difficult and as contentious as they are--and they are; I know that--shed the light of day on the overall financial condition of the Federal Government. Precluding these discussions by removing Congress's authority over the debt limit would lead to a less well-informed decisionmaking over fiscal policy. That is probably the understatement of my remarks. It is a nice way to put it.  We can do this. In the past, legislation to raise the debt limit has frequently been coupled with legislation to reduce the overall Federal debt and deficit. That is the way we should do it. These extensions, often approved on a bipartisan basis, have been important catalysts for fiscal reform. In this respect, the debt limit is a strong mechanism, a strong tool, a way for Congress to evaluate fiscal policy and to maintain control over such policy.  Abdicating this role would fundamentally alter the checks and balances embedded in the Constitution. This is a power that should not be bargained away.  The necessary and critical battle to control spending is far from over. I view the debt ceiling debate as a critical means in what has to be an ongoing effort to tighten the government's fiscal belt--if we can just do that. But we cannot settle our national finances by fundamentally altering the constitutional structure and processes governing those finances. We cannot cavalierly give up one of our most important tools in evaluating and reining in the Federal Government's runaway spending.  Equally clear, we cannot keep spending what we do not have. We must continue to fight for spending cuts, for debt reduction, and against tax increases and, I might add, the tidal wave of regulations that continue to pour out of Washington.  In response to calls to give up this vital congressional authority over debt issuance, I am submitting today a simple resolution. Let's put the Senate on record. The Congress holds the sole authority to borrow money on the creditof the United States and cannot cede this power to the President.  I invite everybody to cosponsor this important measure and look forward to passage of this resolution. This should be a bipartisan effort, and it is absolutely necessary.                          ____________________
