President, I wish to share with you an experience from last Friday. We had a field hearing in Oklahoma on the Partnership for Fish and Wildlife. This is a program not many people know about. It is one that hasnot ever been authorized, but it is one that has gone year to year with an appropriation, whereby a landowner who is trying to do something for the environment, trying to do something for conservation, trying to do something for habitat will put up $3 for every $1 the Fish and Wildlife Service puts up to join a partnership with them.
