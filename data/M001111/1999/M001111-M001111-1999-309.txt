 I am more than ready to do a time agreement, to do this quickly. The reason it is so important to do it now is it is bipartisan. It is absolutely timely in terms of school boards and school districts putting their budgets together. I actually heard the chairman of the committee this morning talk about the fact that the reason we should move Ed-Flex forward is that it is bipartisan and it is timely, not to wait for ESEA.
