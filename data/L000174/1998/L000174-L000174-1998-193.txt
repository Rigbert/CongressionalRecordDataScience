President, the Senator from Kentucky is right. I support the pending amendment.  Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to discuss with the subcommittee chairman, Senator McConnell, his amendments to modify section 540(b) and section 752(a) of the bill, modifications which I strongly support.  It is my understanding that the purpose of the change to section 540(b) is to make clear that funds in the bill may be used, notwithstanding any other provision of law, to support energy programs aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, because of concerns expressed by certain senators that requests to AID for specific information about these activities was not provided and that they therefore have been unable to determine precisely what these funds were used for, they requested that these funds be subject to the Committees' regular notification procedures. Does the subcommittee chairman agree that the purpose of subjecting these funds to the notification procedures is not to prevent funding for these activities notwithstanding any other provision of law, since we could have done that by simply leaving the section as it is, but rather to be sure that the Congress gets the information it requests?  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator is correct. AID has not been responsive to the requests of senators for information about these activities. We are adding the notification requirement to section 540(b) in order to ensure that information that is requested about certain energy programs is provided in a timely way.
