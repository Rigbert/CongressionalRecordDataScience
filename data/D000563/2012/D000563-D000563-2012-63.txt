President, I wish to take a moment to wish Mayor John Rednour of Du Quoin, IL, a happy 78th birthday and to thank him as he prepares to retire after so many great years of public service to his town and Illinois.  John Rednour, known to most people as simply Rednour, has served as mayor of Du Quoin since 1989. Public service was his third career. He started work as an ironworker, a member of the United Ironworkers. He worked on projects in St. Louis and in Chicago and served as site superintendent during construction of the U.S. Federal penitentiary in Marion.  In 1970 John moved to Du Quoin with his wife Wanda and three kids. In the early 1980s John began his second career when he and some local shareholders took control of the Du Quoin State Bank, converting it into a community bank that served downstate Illinois. Today the bank stands as one of the strongest in our State, and John remains the bank's chairman.  But it was John Rednour's work as mayor of Du Quoin that really distinguished his public service. In his 23 years as mayor, he focused on balancing the city's budget and investing in its infrastructure. His legacy to Du Quoin includes construction of the Poplar Street overpass--a major thoroughfare for travel on Highway 51 through southern Illinois--improved water service and the development of an industrial park. He managed to do all of this with a balanced budget, creating new opportunities for his community even in tough times.  He is a member of the five-person Illinois State Police Merit Board and a proud Democrat, I might add, but he knows there are some things that need to be done on a bipartisan basis. He has made it his habit to meet with the Du Quoin city council members and offered to take advice from each and every one of them. He told them to always vote for what is good for Du Quoin.  Loretta and I consider ourselves lucky to count John and Wanda Rednour among our friends. We have many happy memories of State fair parties at the Rednour home during our trips to the Du Quoin State Fair. Loretta and I have been regular visitors to Rednour's home and have warm memories of staying overnight after the fair party and having Wanda greet us at breakfast with her so-called Texas pancakes--and they could fit in the State of Texas.  As a labor leader, businessman, mayor, husband, and father, John Rednour has contributed enormously to Du Quoin, downstate Illinois, and to our entire State and Nation. While his day-to-day presence in city hall is going to be missed, residents of Du Quoin can take comfort in knowing that John Rednour's leadership is still in their community, with a strong foundation and a bright future.  In addition to three children, John and Wanda are blessed with five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren, who I am sure are going to be glad to have more time with John and Wanda now.  I thank John for his many years of distinguished public service. Loretta and I wish him and his family all the best in retirement. We look forward to many more stories and more pancakes in the years to come.                          ____________________
