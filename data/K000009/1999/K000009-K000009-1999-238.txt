Chairman, I thank the gentleman very much for pointing that out. If we look at what has happened with prices, the figure that the gentleman stated, the over $1 billion figure, will help us to buy more with the American tax dollar to send abroad. That is true. But the amount of surplus that we have on domestic markets is drowning our rural communities.  As we sit here and argue today, and we will not produce a bill that will aid our farmers this spring, this Congress is going to fail in that responsibility. This should have been the first bill this Congress considered when we convened this year, and we have failed that responsibility to our own people.
