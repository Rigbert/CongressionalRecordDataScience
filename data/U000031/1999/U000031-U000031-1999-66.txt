Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time.  Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to commend my friend, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutsch) and all the speakers who have spoken this afternoon on both sides of the aisle. We know what the right vote is. That is a ``yes'' vote on this resolution. We have had enough.  Frankly, the appropriators I think all of us wish had depleted their work a long time ago. The emergencies are well-known. Many of these pork barrel projects should have been stripped from the very beginning. And I would hope that today's vote not only will pass but will send a very strong signal to those conferees that enough is enough, no more of this pork ought to be added to bills that really must pass.  My friend, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind) talked about going to the funeral this weekend or maybe perhaps tonight or tomorrow with regard to the brave helicopter pilot who died from Wisconsin. As I think about his message, I think about my weekend this weekend when I am going to go visit some almost 200 reservists who are leaving from Kalamazoo Battle Creek and will be leaving this weekend, Air Force reservists, to go to the Balkans.  And as I talk to other military folks from around the world, the Air Force colonel who just came back from a tour in Hungary 6 months, living in a tent that was so old that the fire retardant was not good anymore and they were wondering how it was going to last another winter with the heater that they might have in it.  The mother that I talked to this last weekend in Michigan, whose son is aTrident submarine trainee who does not have the books or can pay literally for the uniform they need to wear. I think about the woman that I talked to from Oklahoma City the other day who, after surviving the tornado, talked to me a little bit about her experience there and how it came so close to Tinker Air Force Base. And my comment was, boy, they must have looked like Chicago O'Hare with all those planes taking off so that we did not end up with a complete disaster there. And her response was, ``No, they do not have enough crews to fly those planes out. It could have been another Pearl Harbor, even worse than the situation there.''                              {time}  1500  We need to help our troops as they prepare for whatever lies ahead of them, that their life is as good as we can make it with housing and everything else. For this bill to come back cluttered from the Senate, filled with these items, whether they be environmental or other junk, is not right. It would be a travesty for us to recede to the Senate in a number of these issues. I would hope we could pass this resolution to send it back to both chambers clean, and that the emergency measures in both bills that all of us agree to here, Republicans and Democrats, would come back unfettered, that we would be proud to vote for this thing.  I think the signal that we are sending to our leadership and really to the rest of the country is if it does come back with a lot of these projects, then in fact the vote that I cast a couple of weeks ago, a ``yes'' vote for this, will in fact be reversed and I will vote ``no.''  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote for this motion.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore
