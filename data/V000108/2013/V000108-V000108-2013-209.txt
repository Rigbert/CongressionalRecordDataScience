Speaker, as we celebrate the birth of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and reflect on his life and work, we are reminded of the challenges that democracy poses to us and the delicate nature of liberty. Dr. King's life, and, unfortunately, his untimely death, reminds us that we must continually work to secure and protect our freedoms. Dr. King, in his courage to act, his willingness to meet challenges, and his ability to achieve, embodied all that is good and true in the battle for liberty.  The spirit of Dr. King lives on in the citizens of communities throughout our nation. It lives on in the people whose actions reflect the spirit of resolve and achievement that will help move our country into the future. I am honored to rise today to recognize several individuals from Indiana's First Congressional District, who will be recognized during the 34th Annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Breakfast on Saturday, January 19, 2013, at the Genesis Convention Center in Gary, Indiana. The Gary Frontiers Service Club, which was founded in 1952, sponsors this annual breakfast.  This year, the Gary Frontiers Service Club will pay tribute to local individuals who have for decades unselfishly contributed to improving the quality of life for the people of Gary. Notably, David D. Chube Sr., MD will be honored with the prestigious Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drum Major Award for 2013. Additionally, several individuals will be recognized as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Marchers at this year's breakfast including, Patricia Diana DeNeal, Elder Rozelle Hammonds, Pastor Dr. Marion J. Johnson Jr., Joseph Slay Jr., and Ann West-Walker. Finally, Ferba R. Hines was selected as the 2012 Yokefellow of the Year.  Though very different in nature, the achievements of each of these individuals reflect many of the same attributes that Dr. King possessed, as well as the values he advocated. Like Dr. King, these individuals saw challenges and faced them with unwavering strength and determination. Each one of the honored guests' greatness has been found in their willingness to serve with ``a heart full of grace and a soul generated by love.'' They set goals and work selflessly to make them a reality.  Mr. Speaker, I urge you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending these honorees, as well as the Gary Frontiers Service Club officers, President Oliver J. Gilliam, Vice President Sean Jones, 1st Vice President James Piggee, Recording Secretary Linnal Ford, Financial Secretary Sam Frazier, Corresponding Secretary Ferba R. Hines, and Treasurer/Seventh District Director Floyd Donaldson, as well as Breakfast Chairman Clorius L. Lay, in addition to all other members of the service club for their initiative, determination, and dedication to serving the people of Northwest Indiana.                          ____________________
