A bungled government hack could damage systems at hospitals, the power grid, transportation, or other critical infrastructure, and Congress has not had a single hearing on this issue--not one.  In addition, the Rules Enabling Act gives Congress the opportunity to weigh in, which is exactly what my colleagues hope to be doing now on this important issue.  Because of these serious damages, I introduced a bill called the Stop Mass Hacking Act with a number of my colleagues, including Senators Daines and Paul. This bill would stop these changes from taking effect, and I am here this morning to ask unanimous consent that the bill be taken up and passed.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. 2952 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration, that the bill be read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.
