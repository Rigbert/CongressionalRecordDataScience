Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, the gentlewoman from New York for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, this resolution is a waste of time and money. We are sent to Congress to make progress on behalf of the people of this Nation, yet House Republicans spend all of their time and energy fighting this President. Why?  The Republicans need to jump off the bandwagon of political attacks and come together to jump-start the economy. While Americans were unemployed, they did nothing to put them back to work. When people were losing their homes, they did little to protect them from foreclosure. While hunger and poverty are on the rise in this country, they have hardly mentioned the disappearing middle class.  From his first day in office, Republicans in the House, in this House, have never supported this President. Every olive branch he has extended was broken.  But today, Mr. Speaker, they have reached a low, a very low point. This resolution to sue the President just goes a little too far. It is a shame and a disgrace that we are here debating the suing of the President. The American people deserve better. We can do better. We can do much better.
