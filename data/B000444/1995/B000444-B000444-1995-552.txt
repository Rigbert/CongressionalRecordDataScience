 President, in over 20 years in the Senate I do not think I have done this twice, but I will say, to be safe, I do not think I have done it a half dozen times. I would like to read into the Record a letter that I received yesterday from a woman who is graduating from high school in my State, a woman I have never met. Her name is Mrs. Judi Robinson. She lives in old New Castle, DE, which is a community over 350 years old, a beautiful place, in a place called Penn Acres. I would like to read it, if I may.       Dear Senator Biden, I am a 48-year-old night student at      William Penn High School in New Castle. I'm one of many      students who recently wrote to you concerning adult      education. Thank you for your letter. It helped me a little      more to understand what it concerns.       I have been in the program since September 1994 and      received my G.E.D. that June. Now I'm at Penn doing very well      and will [[Page S7599]] graduate this June. It took me 31      years to get to this point in my life, so I thank God that      there was a program available to me. Although my      circumstances are different than some of my classmates, we're      all there for the same reasons, to get our G.E.D. or better      yet our diploma. Senator as far as I'm concerned, I wanted      this very badly, but I have been married 27 years, have two      children one of which also graduates this year from Penn. I      never had to work so my education wasn't the top on my list.      Because my husband worked and took care of us and the house.      But most of the kids in the program need this educational      program to continue to grow into productive adults. Our      counselors and teachers are the best, they work very hard to      keep things going well at school. These programs need to keep      going and I know that you will do your best to keep it going.       Now to get to the second reason I'm writing to you. I would      like to take this opportunity to invite you to my graduation      on June 14 at 7:30 p.m. It will take place at Newark High      School. Myself and I know all the other students and staff      would be honored to have you there. I know you are a very,      very busy man but if you could find it in your heart and      schedule to make it, I would be happy to have you there.           Sincerely,                                               Mrs. Judi Robinson.  Mr. President, the reason I read that into the Record is I do not think we should lose sight of the fact that there are thousands and thousands and thousands of women and men like Judi Robinson who are going back to try to get the basic education that for whatever reasons they did not get when they were children. I think our reluctance to put as much emphasis on the educational needs in this country and the Federal responsibility to participate in that is a serious mistake. I am sure all of my colleagues, and I know the Senator in the chair, the Senator from Colorado, like everyone else in here, shares a sense of pride when there is someone in their State like Judi Robinson who goes through that effort.  I remember discussing with my friend from Colorado how his mother went back and her significant educational accomplishments and what she has done. I just thought it worthwhile to let people know that there are a lot of people like Judi Robinson still fighting hard, who still have faith in this operation, still have faith in the system, and still think they can better themselves through education.  I thank the Chair for this time and I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
