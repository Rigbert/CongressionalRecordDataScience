 President, this week we are continuing to confirm more unobjectionable nominees who had to move through the Senate more slowly than they should. Yesterday we confirmed Sarah Daggett Morrison to serve as U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of Ohio, and despite the fact that our Democratic friends forced us to file cloture on her nomination, when she finally received a vote, she was confirmed 89 to 7.  That is probably because Ms. Morrison, like the other nominees we are considering this week, is thoroughly noncontroversial and very well-qualified for the job. Thanks to the modest reforms to the Senate rules we put in place this spring, more nominees who fit this description are being confirmed in a fraction of the time it would have otherwise taken.  So I hope the strong bipartisan support we saw yesterday will be shown to the jurists we will vote to confirm on the Federal bench today: Pamela Barker to the Northern District of Ohio; Corey Maze to the Northern District of Alabama; Rodney Smith to the Southern District of Florida; Thomas Barber to the Middle District of Florida; and Jean-Paul Boulee to the Northern District of Georgia.  Together, these nominees possess more than a century of legal experience. Their resumes include work in State attorneys' offices, as county judges, and as State solicitor general. They include a former U.S. Army defense counsel and a U.S. Supreme Court litigator. Each has demonstrated a commitment to upholding the Constitution and preserving the rule of law. Each deserves strong, bipartisan support.                          ____________________
