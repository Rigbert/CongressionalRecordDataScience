Speaker, since August of this year, the people of Prince George's County, Maryland, have lost two of their finest. Tragically, in separate incidents, two Prince George's County police officers were killed in car crashes. Both men served with distinction and were dedicated to keeping our communities safe.  On August 20, while he and his partner were in a high-speed pursuit of a suspect in an attempted car theft, Officer Adrian Morris's police cruiser veered off of the Capital Beltway near Laurel, Maryland. Adrian was killed in the line of duty, and his partner, Mike Risher, severely injured. An immigrant originally from Kingston, Jamaica, Adrian wanted to be a police officer since a young age. While attending Eleanor Roosevelt High School in Greenbelt, he participated in the Prince George's County Police ``Explorers'' program, which helps young people learn about and prepare for careers in law enforcement. Adrian achieved his dream by joining the Prince George's County Police Department's Sixth District in 2010. When he was killed this past August, Adrian was only 23 years old. His mother, Sherrin Crosdale, and a younger brother survive him.  In a second, tragic setback to the men and women of the Prince George's County Police Department, on October 18 an accident took another officer's life. Off-duty Officer Kevin Donnell Bowden was headed home in his police cruiser after a shift when he was killed in a crash in Clinton, Maryland. Kevin had been with the force for six years, serving at the Oxon Hill station. His colleagues remembered him as a steady officer with a sense of humor who loved his job. Kevin grew up in the area and graduated from Surratsville High School. He loved football and was an avid fan of the Dallas Cowboys. Kevin, who was 28 years old, was also a devoted father of sons DeAndre and Joshua and daughter Mahogany.  The loss of these two outstanding officers was a terrible blow to the Prince George's County Police Department and to all who call the County home. Adrian Morris and Kevin Bowden represent the finest tradition of service to our communities, and they will be sorely missed. I join in mourning their passing and in comforting their families and communities during this difficult time, and I am confident that their memories will inspire young people to follow in their footsteps in service to county, state, and country.                          ____________________
