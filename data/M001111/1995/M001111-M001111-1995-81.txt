 President, I rise today to support the conference agreement on H.R. 1854, the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1996. Compromises between the House and Senate version of this bill were necessary in order to reach this agreement, and I am pleased that we were able to work out our differences cooperatively.  The appropriations made in the conference report total $2,184,856,000. This is a $205,698,700 below the 1995 level, and roughly $5 million below the Senate-passed bill.  I want to at this time express my appreciation and respect for Senator Mack, the subcommittee chairman. He handled this bill in a very open, nonpartisan manner. He took his responsibility seriously and he did a very excellent job, and he was really good to work with. I thank him publicly for the hard work he has done on this bill.  We did not agree on every issue. I am particularly concerned about the elimination of the Office of Technology Assessment. However, Senator Mack made sure all views on this subject were fully aired in conference before we settled this issue.  In the end, we were able to get some protection for OTA workers to ensure that they are not thrown out on the street the moment this bill passes. I want to thank our chairman for his help with that matter, as well.  I also want to take a moment to express a few personal thoughts about this bill. This bill cuts over $200 million out of the congressional budget. That is about a 10-percent cut. In this time of fiscal deficits, and the need to reduce spending, I believe we did it the way it should be done--line by line, program by program, bill by bill. We thought this through and made tough, but sensible, decisions. Most importantly, we are showing we can lead by example in the battle to reduce Federal spending by cutting Congress first.  I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the conference report. It makes sense, and it sets the right tone in the broader effort to reduce spending.  (
