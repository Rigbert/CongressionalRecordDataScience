 President, I am proud to cosponsor this amendment with my friend from California, Senator Boxer. Over the years, as she hasalready indicated, we have worked together as a watchdog of the Pentagon, and being a watchdog of that agency is not an easy job. Whether Republicans or Democrats are running this place, it is always tough when we tangle with the Pentagon. It is not a very popular thing to do.  Senator Boxer has always been a reliable person to fight to get the most bang for the taxpayers' dollars in defense. And I compliment her on that.  In today's political environment, reliable defense reform allies are hard to come by.
