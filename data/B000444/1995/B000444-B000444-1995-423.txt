 President, the Senator from Pennsylvania is here. He has an amendment, No. 1206, relating to foreign assistance. We have been discussing this with him. We think it is a good amendment. We have suggested a few minor changes relative to the amount of distribution under the amendment.  I understand the Senator from Pennsylvania is prepared to send his amended amendment to the desk, and we are prepared to accept it.
