President, I realize it is not possible, because agreement has not yet been reached, to set aside the pending legislation to bring up the Habeas Corpus Restoration Act as an amendment. As the managers of the bill are not on the floor, I certainly will not take advantage of that and do it. So let me speak about it.  I now am speaking on the National Defense Authorization Act. At an appropriate time, I will bring up amendment No. 2022. I will tell you why I will do this.  Last year, Congress committed an historic mistake by suspending the Great Writ of habeas corpus--not just for those confined at Guantanamo Bay but for millions of legal residents in the United States.
