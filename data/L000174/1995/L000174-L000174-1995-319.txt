President, it is true that this amendment by itself would save money. But you could also say that if we had an amendment that totally did away with the food stamp program that would save even more money.  Basically what this says is you could be somebody who has worked in the plant for 15 years, you paid your taxes, you are an upright citizen who paid for the programs and everything else, and if that factory, the largest employer in the area, should suddenly close, and you cannot find a job within 30 or 31 days later and if you are looking for food stamps you are not going to get them because you have not worked in the last 30 days. This is far too punitive. It is going to make it extremely difficult, as the senior Senator from Indiana said, for those who have been employed who because of a disaster or a plant closing or something else are out of a job. It goes much too far.                       food stamp work amendment
