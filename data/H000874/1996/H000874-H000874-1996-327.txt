Speaker, we have risen to historic heights of irresponsibility led by our history professor. What a shame. What a shame. A previous speaker said that we needed a key to unlock Government, and he did not have the key. He was wrong.  This is the key given to all 435 of us by the voters of our districts. It is a district question for each of us to be reasonable and responsible. We had that opportunity yesterday and we had a vote, and of all of the Republicans in the House, only two, only two of my colleagues, the gentlewoman from Maryland [Mrs. Morella] and the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Davis], used this card to unlock the lockout of Government employees and Government services to the American public.  My friend from Virginia who spoke previously said, stop making this a partisan issue. Bob Dole is the leading candidate for President in the Republican Party. He said, this does not make sense.                          ____________________
