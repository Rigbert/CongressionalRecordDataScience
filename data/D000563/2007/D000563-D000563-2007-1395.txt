President, I say to my colleague from Tennessee, whose interest in education is well recognized, I couldn't agree with him more. Not only is this program important, it is important to me. When the superintendent of the Chicago Public School System, Arnie Duncan, called me yesterday and said we need this money, I said to him: I know you do. It breaks my heart that we cannot give it to you at this moment.  I can go through the sordid history that brought us to this continuing resolution--our failure to pass the appropriations bills in the normal fashion last year, extending the Government on a piecemeal basis with a CR, as we call them, for a few months, and now facing the awesome task of funding the rest of the year with certainly limitations in funding that have caused a great deal of deprivation. This is a clear illustration and example of a program that is worth funding and that should be funded.  I say to my friend from Tennessee, if we cannot resolve it in this particular bill--and I doubt that we can because of the extraordinary circumstances--please let me join him and let's have others join in making sure this program is solid and funded for the next fiscal year. It is a good program, an excellent program. I want to see it move forward.  The quality of teachers may be the single greatest determinant in the success of education. I certainly want to join the Senator from Tennessee in making that happen.                          ____________________
