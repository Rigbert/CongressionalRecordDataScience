I would prefer to be far closer to what the Senate has voted on time and time and time again.  I understand the realities of the situation, though, and this is where we are. The irony is that those who are holding up family planning money, claiming they are doing it because of their opposition to abortion, are assuring that there will be more abortions in the countries we send the family planning money to.  The family planning money, in so many of these countries, has provided a strong alternative to abortion, because many countries use abortion as a method of birth control. Our family planning money would cut down abortions. It has been proven.  For the life of me, I cannot understand this topsy-turvy, ``Alice in Wonderland,'' view of cutting family planning money and saying we are trying to stop abortions, because its does nothing of the kind. In fact, when people have access to family planning, the abortions go down.
