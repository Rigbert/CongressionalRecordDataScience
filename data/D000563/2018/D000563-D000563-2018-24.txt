President, I want to join my colleagues in thanking our friend, Senator Joe Donnelly, for his service to his State and our Nation.  When he was about 30 years old, while he was practicing law in South Bend, Joe Donnelly sought the Democratic nomination for attorney general in Indiana. Two years later, he ran for State senate. Both times, he lost.  Then he did something truly astonishing: He walked away from politics. For 10 years, he practiced law and ran a small stamp-and-ink business.  In 2003, local party officials asked him to run for Congress. They didn't expect him to win--just be a respectable sacrificial lamb.  He came closer to winning than anyone but he expected.  Two years later, he was elected, in a rematch, to the U.S. House.  As someone who also ran and lost three times before winning an election, I feel a natural camaraderie with my friend from Indiana.  I think I may also have some insight into why he was willing to try one more time.  You see, Joe Donnelly grew up in New York. He moved to South Bend for college, and he is a Hoosier, through-and-through, but he is also a member of the great White Sox Nation.  In 2005, the Chicago White Sox won the World Series for the first time in 88 years--proof, some would say, that anything is possible if you persevere and work hard.  The next year, it was Joe Donnelly's turn to score the upset victory by winning election to Congress from a red district in a deep-red State.  In his 6 years in the House, he voted to create the Affordable Care Act.  During the financial crisis of 2009, he voted for the American Recovery Act, to stop America's slide into a second great depression that could have brought down the entire global economy.  When free market hardliners said, ``Save Wall Street but let the American auto industry die,'' Barack Obama said no--and so did Joe.  In November 2012, Hoosier voters sent Joe Donnelly to the U.S. Senate, the first Democrat to hold his seat since 1977.  In a political era that often seems often to reward snark over substance, Joe Donnelly is a soft-spoken throwback to an earlier era, when working across the aisle was viewed as a talent, not as treason.  Joe is decent, honest, and direct. You may disagree with him on an issue, but you will never doubt his motives.  His values are classic Hoosier: hard work, common sense, bipartisan compromise, and a disdain for grandstanding.  As a Senator, he has done what he believes is needed to level the playing field for ``regular Joes,'' for farmers and factory workers and, as he says, ``the people who go to work in the dark and come home in the dark.''  I particularly want to thank him for his work to improve mental health care for military members and veterans. That work will save lives and families.  Like all nations, the White Sox Nation has some laws. One of my favorites is: ``Respect the past . . . people that are shoeless . . . and anyone named Joe.''  That last edict is a reference to one of the legends of White Sox history, Shoeless Joe Jackson, but it applies equally to our friend and colleague, Senator Joe Donnelly, who has served his State and our Nation well and earned our great respect.                          ____________________
