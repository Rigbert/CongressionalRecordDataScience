 Let me say to him that I would certainly be open on this side of the aisle, as, I am sure, my Members would be, to working with him to address those issues.  It is not a question of Flint, per se, but it is a question of some 6,000 to 9,000 children who have been exposed immediately, and it is an emergency now as they are not able to drink the water; they are drinking bottled water.  My point is not that we ought not to address problems in California or, very frankly, in Maryland or in Ohio or in Florida or wherever else they may occur in league with the States and municipalities. Obviously, this is a partnership, not just our responsibility.                              {time}  1145  I would again reiterate, Zika and Ebola are both emergencies that need to be dealt with now. I think the gentleman is absolutely correct that we ought to know how much is needed, how it is going to be spent, and what effect it will have.  I will tell you that one of my members in the whip meeting this morning, Mr. Leader, said that her understanding from her local health department was that their efforts with respect to Ebola and other infectious diseases are being adversely affected by the fact that that $589 million, which didn't just come out of the air, was transferred, as you pointed out and as I pointed out, to the Zika response. It was money that was--not obligated--planned to be spent in communities and in other areas to effect a solution to the challenge that confronts us.  So it is not just as if that $589 million didn't have a purpose when we originally appropriated it. The gentleman supported it and I support it, so we allocated that money. I know the Appropriations Committee supported it. And I presume, as the gentleman points out, they had hearings to know exactly the answers to the questions. But we will work with you on getting answers to those questions from the administration.  We would urge that, within the next few weeks, we have a supplemental on the floor, having those questions answered and being confident that the money is going to be spent, but knowing full well that people's health is at risk in this country. We have an empathy and a concern about that and want to respond to it. So I would hope that we could move it before the appropriations process because I think, unfortunately, the experience is, under all the parties that have been in control of this House over the years, that sometimes it happens slower than this emergency requires.  I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________
