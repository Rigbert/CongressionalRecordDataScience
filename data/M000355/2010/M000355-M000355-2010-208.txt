 President, I rise to pay tribute to an honored Kentuckian, Mr. Harry Morgan Hoe. A graduate of the Kentucky Military Institute, Harry's leadership skill and valor were on full display at the age of 19, when he joined the 4th Infantry Division and stormed the beaches of Normandy. For his service, he was awarded both the Silver and Bronze Stars, among other medals. Upon returning to civilian life, Harry earned a degree in business and more importantly, at least to Harry, met his wife Mary while at college. The couple returned to Middlesboro after graduation and Harry joined in the family business--a foundry. He would go on to serve his community as chairman of the Clear Creek Baptist Bible College and his work with the Cumberland Gap National Park board, the Mountain Laurel Festival board, as well as several other service organizations.  While I could certainly go on about the character of Harry Hoe, let me conclude by saying that Harry Hoe's impact in Middlesboro, Kentucky, should be a model by which we all pattern our approach to leadership--built on humility and grace.  Mr. President, the Middlesboro Daily News recently published a profile story on Mr. Harry Hoe. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Middlesboro Daily News, May 5, 2010]                   ``Harry Hoe--An Enduring Leader''                            By Lorie Settles       Harry Morgan Hoe began his life 85-years ago in      Middlesboro. He remembers a town much different than the one      most of us are familiar with today--where groceries were      delivered and children walked to school. The simplicity of      life remains one of his dearest memories.       ``Growing up here was a real treat,'' Harry recalled,      ``everything was free and easy. The town was growing; they      were building buildings and paving streets.'' Harry's      generation was the first of his family to grow up in      Middlesboro. In 1909, J.R. Hoe, Harry's grandfather, moved      his family to Kentucky from Pittsburg, PA after a labor      strike put an end to his career as the superintendent of a      large steel mill. He purchased the town foundry and re-named      it J.R. Hoe and Sons. Together, he and his five sons worked      long hours to create the business Middlesboro knows today.       ``My father worked like a dog,'' Hoe remembered. ``He      poured 20,000 pounds of iron per day and the things had to be      carried, by hand, to the railroad station.'' Harry went to      Louisville to attend high school at the Kentucky Military      Institute, from which he graduated in 1943. At the age of 17,      just before graduation, he received his draft notice for      World War II. After a few months of training, he briefly      returned home to see his family, and then shipped out. ``We      had all gone through basic training; we'd done the physical      exercises and the bayonets and it was fun . . . It never got      through to me that we were training to kill,'' he remembered.      He arrived with the 4th Infantry Division on the beaches of      Normandy shortly thereafter. ``I served under General      Patton,'' Harry recalls. ``He said: Half of you guys are not      going home, you know that don't you? You're over     here to take that hill and if you don't take it, I want to      see the truckload of dog tags that show me that you proved      yourself.' So we fought. We were his soldiers--that was all      we knew to do.''       He was decorated with the Silver Star for gallantry in      action, the Bronze Star, the Oak Leaf Cluster for heroic      action and the French Liberation Appreciation Medal--all      before reaching the age of 19.       During his tour of duty, Harry fought in five major      European campaigns. ``It was different then,'' he said. ``It      was a different war. Everyone was for it, we were very      patriotic. We wanted to keep Hitler from ruining the world.''       His return home was bittersweet. ``I spent weeks when I      came home saying: `What? He didn't come back either? He's      dead too?' The boys you hugged at the train station, the ones      that came back, were badly wounded and missing limbs. We      didn't see all of the consequences until the war was over,''      he remembered.       Shortly after his return, he enrolled at the University of      Tennessee. He graduated in 1949 with a B.S. in Business. ``My      father wanted me to go to college,'' Harry said. ``I thought      that I was too mature. I'd been to war, I felt too old for      college life.'' He met his wife, Mary, at the university      through a friend from Middlesboro and the two quickly became      an item. He credits much of his success and happiness to      Mary, who insisted that he finish college and worked as a      librarian at UT after her own graduation while Harry      completed his education.       ``She was my secret weapon,'' Harry said of the woman he      lost just last year. ``She was easy to love.'' The couple      returned to Middlesboro after finishing school and Harry went      to work for the family business. Though he was unsure that he      would remain in the business, he viewed it as a chance to      gain experience.       His family was happy to have him as the first college      graduate in the company for as long as he wished to stay. In      1953, Harry Morgan Hoe was honored as one of the three      Outstanding Young Men of Kentucky. His accomplishments would      only become more impressive as time went on. Harry worked as      the director of the Kentucky Utilities company for 19 years,      and was honored by the company with a $100,000 donation that      was awarded to Clear Creek Baptist Bible College. He served      as a board member of the college for 20 years and as chairman      for two terms.       The first integrated Little League Baseball team south of      the Ohio River was instigated in Middlesboro in 1953. Harry      began the team and was its president for seven years. In      1959, Harry worked as general chairman for the dedication of      the Cumberland Gap National Park. He has been the director of      Kentucky Mountain Laurel Festival Board for 55 years and      served twice as president. Harry also acted as chairman of      the board of directors of Kentuckians for Better      Transportation and Associated Industries in Kentucky. He      spent two 3-year terms as director of the Kentucky Chamber of      Commerce.       In 1964, Harry Hoe decided to try his hand at state      politics. He was elected to the Kentucky House of      Representatives, where he served for six years. He wrote the      Drunk Driving Bill in 1968, and in what seemed to many      Kentucky politicians and reporters of the day as an unlikely      turn of events, it passed. Harry vividly recalls the day the      bill finally got off of the ground: ``It was the last day of      the legislature and a lot of my opponents were out      celebrating at a bar. So I went back to the House and asked      the Speaker to allow me to introduce my bill, as a favor      since it was my last term. The bill passed the House. I took      it to the Lieutenant Governor and asked for a vote in the      Senate. No one wanted to be on record as being for drunk      driving, but Kentucky produced a lot of whiskey. The      Governor, Louie Nunn, wouldn't sign it. He let it sit there      for 10 days. The law states that after ten days, if he hasn't      signed a bill that has passed the House and Senate, it      becomes law.''       Harry was the minority whip and the assistant minority      floor leader. He spent 12 years serving on the Kentucky      Republican State Central Committee and was recently inducted      into the Republican 5th Congressional District hall of Fame      by Congressman Hal Rogers.       He has been a deacon of the First Baptist Church for the      past 60 years and served as chairman of the deacons for three      terms. In addition, he has sung in the church's choir for 60      years and been a Sunday School teacher for 55. Harry was      awarded the Salvation Army William Booth Award, the highest      honor given by the charity, after serving as chairman. He is      a life member of the Salvation Army Advisory Board and has      been for 60 years.       The Kiwanis Club of Middlesboro has had the benefit of      Harry's membership since 1949. He was twice elected president      and has won several awards including Kiwanian of the Year. He      founded the Middlesboro High School Key Club in 1954. Today,      Harry lives in the same house he bought 45-years ago with his      wife, Mary.       He continues to work, as needed, at the J.R. Hoe and Sons      foundry, where he served as the President of the firm from      1988 until 2009. He enjoys spending some of his free time      with his and Mary's three children: Priscilla, Harry (Bo),      and Marilyn, and with his seven grandchildren.                          ____________________
