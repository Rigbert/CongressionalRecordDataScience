Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and at the outset, I would like to recognize some exemplary students from Hamilton High School West and Vicki Schoeb, their dedicated teacher, and thank them for being here to observe the workings of the Hill, especially the proceedings of the House. They are very much welcomed to this Chamber.  Mr. Speaker, today the House moves to the timely consideration of H. Res. 339, which urges the Government of the Ukraine to ensure a democratic, transparent, and fair election process leading up to the March 31 parliamentary elections. I would like to thank our majority leader, the gentleman from Texas, (Mr. Armey), for his commitment to schedule this timely and important resolution this week so that it happens before and so that, hopefully, it will have some impact on the proceedings.  I was pleased to be one of the original sponsors of this resolution which acknowledges the strong relationship between the United States and Ukraine, urges the Ukrainian Government to enforce impartially its new election law, and urges the Ukrainian Government to meet its OSCE committments on democratic elections. I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this measure.  Mr. Speaker, the Helsinki Commission, which I chair, has a long-standing record of support for human rights and democratic development in Ukraine. Commission staff will be observing the upcoming elections, as they have done for virtually every election in Ukraine since 1990. The stakes in the Ukrainian elections are high both in terms of the outcome and as an indication of the Ukrainian Government's commitment towards democratic development and integration into Europe.  Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to underscore the reason for this congressional interest in Ukraine. The clear and simple reason: An independent, democratic, and economically stable Ukraine is vital to the well being of all Ukrainians to the stability and security of Europe; and we want to encourage Ukraine in recognizing its own often-stated goal of integration into Europe.  Despite the positive changes that have occurred in the Ukraine since independence in 1991, including the economic growth over the last 2 years, Ukraine is still undergoing a difficult path towards transition. The pace of that transition has been distressing, slowed by insufficient progress in respect for the rule of law, especially by the presence of widespread corruption, which continues to exact a considerable toll on the Ukrainian people. They deserve better, Mr. Speaker, than what they have gotten.  Another source of frustration is the still-unresolved case of murdered investigative journalist, Heorhiy Gongadze. And let me say one thing about him, as well as his widow. Last year, at the OSCE parliamentary assembly which I led, to Paris, my colleagues will remember that we honored him posthumously for his great work and because he paid the ultimate price for his convictions--death.  The flawed investigations of this case and the case of another murdered Ukrainian journalist, Ihor Aleksandrov, call into question Ukraine's commitment to the rule of law. And I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, that going on into the next weeks and months the Helsinki Commission will continue its vigilance. We plan on holding hearings to look into this even further, hopefully keeping pressure on the Ukrainian Government simply to do the right thing.  There have also been a number of disturbing cases of violence and threats of violence. For example, 78-year-old Iryna Senyk, a former political prisoner and poetess, who was campaigning for the pro-reform party, our Ukraine bloc, was badly beaten by unknown assailants.                              {time}  1645  Such unchecked violence has created an uncertain atmosphere.  Most of independent Ukraine's elections have met international democratic standards for elections. The 1999 presidential elections were more problematic, and the OSCE Election Mission Report on these elections asserted that they ``failed to meet a significant number of the OSCE election-related commitments.''  Mr. Speaker, it remains an open question as to whether the March 31 elections will be a step forward for Ukraine. With less than 2 weeks until election day, there are some discouraging indications, credible reports of various violations of the election law, including, one, campaigning by officials or use of state resources to support certain blocs or candidates; second, the denial of public facilities and services to candidates, blocs or parties; three, governmental pressure on certain parties, candidates and media outlets; and, four, a pro-government bias in the public media, especially the government's main television network, UT-1.  Mr. Speaker, these actions are inconsistent with Ukraine's freely undertaken OSCE commitments and undermine its reputation with respect to human rights and democracy. A democratic election process is a must in solidifying Ukraine's democratic credentials and the confidence of its citizens and in its stated desire to integrate with the West.  During his visit to Ukraine last week, the President of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, Adrian Severin, expressed concern over the mistrust in the election process among certain candidates as well as a general skepticism as to whether or not the elections would be truly free and fair, and encouraged Ukrainian officials to take quick measures to ensure that it is a free and fair election and that the outcome is credible.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that the summary of the most recent Long Term Observation Report on the Ukrainian elections prepared by the nonpartisan Committee of Voters of Ukraine, be submitted for the Record.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                announcement by the speaker pro tempore
