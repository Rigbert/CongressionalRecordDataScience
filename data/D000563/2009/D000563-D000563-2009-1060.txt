President, I just left a ceremony in the Hart Office Building, not far from where we are meeting, which is an annual event where the University of Illinois presents the Senator Paul H. Douglas Ethics in Government Award. The 2008 recipient is former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. She is the first woman to be so honored.  There has been a long list of public servants who have distinguished themselves with their integrity and their show of ethics in government who have been acknowledged for this award, and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor certainly follows in that tradition.  It was my good fortune as a young college student to work as an intern in the office of Senator Paul Douglas. It truly shaped my life and convinced me that public service was a good calling, and I was lucky, as I have said many times, to be inspired by the gospels of St. Paul--that would be former Senator Paul Douglas and former Senator Paul Simon--who showed me what I thought was the very best in public service in their honesty--not only dollar honesty but honesty on the issues. It is a great honor for me to continue and serve in the same Senate seat that both of these men occupied.  But today the University of Illinois honored Sandra Day O'Connor, and she is well deserving--the first woman to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. By the time her career was coming to a close, she became one of the most decisive forces on that High Court. During her last decade on the Court, 193 decisions were made by the Court by a vote of 5 to 4. One Justice's vote made the difference, and in 148 of those 193 cases, that one vote was cast by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.  There were so many issues--issues regarding privacy, the rights of people with disabilities, affirming the voting rights of Americans, preserving the rights of universities to use affirmative action, protecting the rights established under McCain-Feingold to have cleaner elections in America, upholding State laws giving individuals their rights under health insurance contracts, preserving the authority of the Federal Government to protect the environment, banning the execution of children, reaffirming America's time-honored tradition of separation of church and state.  One New York Times reporter wrote in 2001 that Justice O'Connor's vote tipped the scale so often that ``we are all living now in Sandra Day O'Connor's America.''  As I said a few moments ago in introducing her at this gathering, one of her most significant and oft-quoted opinions was a recent one--her landmark decision in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, in which she famously wrote:       A state of war is not a blank check for the President when      it comes to the rights of a Nation's citizens.  Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor briefly today to add my voice to so many Americans in gratitude to Sandra Day O'Connor for her great service to Arizona and to the United States of America and to the Supreme Court. I am glad her voice is still strong and part of the public chorus, calling on us to be better as a people and better in government.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the speech I gave during the awards ceremony.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:     Remarks by Assistant Senate Majority Leader Richard J. Durbin    Congratulating Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on Receiving the 2008            Senator Paul H. Douglas Ethics in Government Award       I would like to acknowledge University of Illinois      President Joseph White, Chairman Shah and members of the      University of Illinois Board of Trustees; Robert Rich and the      staff of the Institute of Government and Public Affairs; and      members of the Douglas family.       I also want to acknowledge the members of the Douglas      Senate family--those of us who had the good fortune to have      worked for Paul Douglas in the Senate and whose hearts and      minds and lives were enlarged by his example.       Sadly, there is one important member of the Douglas Senate      family who is missing this year. Paul Douglas lost the use of      his left arm when it was smashed to pieces in Okinawa in      World War II. But he gained another strong right arm when he      and Howard Shuman joined forces in the United States Senate.      On the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act and so many      important battles, Howard Shuman truly was Paul Douglas'      ``right hand man.'' We are all free-er because of their      partnership. It's good to see Howard's daughter Ellen and      other members of the Shuman family here today.       We are here today to celebrate a woman whose courage,      character and wisdom helped preserve many of the same      principles that Paul Douglas spent his life fighting to      protect and enlarge. It is an honor to join you in      recognizing Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.       Before I say a few words about Justice O'Connor, I want to      acknowledge another person whose wisdom and integrity has      served our nation so well--Supreme Court Justice David      Souter.       Thank you, Justice Souter, for your many years of service      to our nation and our Constitution. Your voice on the Court      has made a difference.       Someone asked me once where I found my political      inspiration.       I said, ``Most of it comes from the gospel of St. Paul.''      Paul Douglas. And another brilliant and compassionate      statesmen, Paul Simon. Much of what I know that is good and      important about politics, I learned from them.       Paul Simon once said that the test for a Supreme Court      nominee is not where he or she stands on a given issue. The      real test is: Will this Justice use his or her power on the      Court to restrict freedom, or expand it?       Justice O'Connor and Justice Souter, you have both scored      high grades on the Paul Simon test. Our nation is better for      your service. And we are grateful to you.       If the man or woman President Obama nominates to serve as      America's next Supreme Court Justice is as independent, open-     minded and fair as the two of you--and I feel confident they      will be--our country and our Constitution will be in good      hands.       And now, regarding our guest of honor. What can you give a      woman who has already been inducted into the National Cowgirl      Hall of Fame?       It took 190 years and 101 male Justices before Sandra Day      O'Connor broke the gender barrier on the United States      Supreme Court. It took only 14 years and 16 male recipients      for Justice O'Connor to become the first women recipient of      the Paul Douglas Ethics in Government Award. That is      progress.       Paul Douglas is most closely associated with the civil      rights movement. But he was a true egalitarian. He believed      in equality of opportunity for all people. And he greatly      admired strong, intelligent women.       He kept a series of photographs in his office. One was a      photo of one of his political heroes, Jane Addams, the great      social reformer from Chicago whom he first met in 1921.       My first introduction to Jane Addams was that 1966      campaign. We started off by making a visit to Freeport to lay      flowers on the grave of Jane Addams.       I think it would make Senator Douglas quite proud to see an      award bearing his name presented to a woman who has done so      much to advance the causes of equal justice and equal      opportunity, which were so dear to him.       There are some strong similarities between Senator Douglas      and Justice O'Connor.       He grew up in the Maine woods. She grew up on a ranch in      the high desert on the Arizona-New Mexico border. It was in      those isolated environments of their childhoods that they      both developed a lifelong love of reading and learning.       (Of course, life on the Lazy B Ranch wasn't all books and      reading. By the time she was 8 years old, Justice O'Connor      could drive a truck ... mend a fence ... brand cattle ... and      shoot her own .22 caliber rifle. She had cowboys for friends      and a bobcat for a playmate--good preparation for all those      Supreme Court conferences.)       Another, more important similarity between Senator Douglas      and Justice O'Connor is their shared distrust of ideology.       Here is a fact about Paul Douglas that many people do now      know. His first foray into elected politics was running for      mayor of Chicago as a Republican. He was elected to the Board      of Alderman as an Independent. It wasn't until he first ran      for the Senate     that he aligned himself with the Democratic Party.       Justice O'Connor's ability to see beyond partisan divides      was reflected early when every member of the Senate Judiciary      Committee--from Strom Thurmond to Ted Kennedy--voted to      support her nomination. And it grew over her 24 years on the      Court.       Their mutual commitment to principle rather than political      ideologies enabled both Paul Douglas and Sandra Day O'Connor      to build coalitions to advance our nation's common good. And      for that, we are very grateful.       Here is another similarity: As a member of the Arizona      state Senate, Sandra Day O'Connor once introduced an      amendment to remove a misplaced comma from a bill.       As a college intern, I sat next to Senator Douglas many      nights as he read, and edited, and signed every single letter      that went out under his name. Because he couldn't use his      left arm, it was my job to pull the letters off the top of      the pile as he finished them. Believe me, no misplaced comma      ever escaped his editing pen, either.       But the most important similarity--the reason we are all      here today--is because, like Paul Douglas, Justice O'Connor      used the power she was given to defend and expand our      freedom. With her voice and her vote, she said--time and time      again--that government has an obligation to defend the      powerless from the powerful.       Justice O'Connor was always open to those who could make a      strong case. She listened to the arguments and weighed the      evidence.       During her last decade on the Court, 193 decisions were      decided by a vote of 5-to-4. One Justice's vote made the      difference. And in 148 of those 193 cases, that one vote was      cast by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.       She cast the fifth and deciding vote safeguarding      Americans' right to privacy; requiring that courtrooms be      accessible to people with disabilities; affirming the      obligation of states to protect the voting rights of      minorities; and preserving the rights of universities to use      affirmative action programs.       Justice O'Connor cast the deciding vote preserving the      right of the federal government under the McCain-Feingold law      to place reasonable restrictions on campaign contributions so      that special interest money can't gain overwhelm our      democracy--a vote, I think, that Senator Douglas would have      applauded.       She cast the deciding vote upholding state laws giving      individuals the right to a second doctor's opinion if their      HMO denies them treatment; preserving the authority of the      federal government to protect the environment; banning the      execution of children in America; and reaffirming America's      time-honored tradition of separation of church and state.       Indeed, as a New York Times reporter wrote in 2001, Justice      O'Connor's vote tipped the scales so often that--quote, ``we      are all living now in Sandra Day O'Connor's America.''       And that was before what is perhaps her most significant      opinion: the landmark decision of Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, in which      Justice O'Connor famously wrote: ``A state of war is not a      blank check for the President when it comes to the rights of      the Nation's citizens.''       It strikes me as ironic that Sandra Day O'Connor could have      grown up in a place called the Lazy B Ranch because lazy is      about the last word you could ever use to describe her. Since      leaving the Court nearly four years ago, she has written and      spoken extensively. She has been especially eloquent and      courageous in speaking out in defense of an independent      judiciary.       In 2005, she wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal      about those who seek to score political points by railing      against and trying to intimidate what they call ``activist      federal judges.''       She warned that ``using judges as punching bags presents a      grave threat to the independent judiciary.'' She added: ``We      must be more vigilant in making sure that criticism does not      cross over into intimidation ... that the current mood of      cynicism does not end up compromising the rule of law.       For all she has done to advance the cause of equal justice      and equal opportunity in America, and for her continued      defense of our courts and our Constitution, Justice Sandra      Day O'Connor is a true American she-ro and a worthy recipient      of the Paul Douglas Ethics in Government Award. Thank you      again, Justice O'Connor, for your selfless service to our      nation.
