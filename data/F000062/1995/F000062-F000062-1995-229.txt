 President, today, Senator Boxer and I are introducing legislation that will allow for the Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority to issue tax-free bonds to help construct the Alameda corridor, probably the most important transportation project currently under consideration anywhere in the United States.  The Alameda corridor is a $1.8 billion project that will allow the San Pedro Bay ports--Los Angeles and Long Beach--to expand and grow well into the 21st century. The project, in the years ahead, will require a Federal authorization of $700 million, the necessary Federal commitment. The ports have committed well over $400 million to purchase railroad rights-of-way.  But, initial construction will be funded by the issuance of bonds, and that is why this bill is so vital. Tax-free bonds can currently be issued for construction of harbor and port facilities, but under current law, the corridor would not apply since the major distribution center is 20 miles inland from the port. This legislation would extend the ability to issue tax-free bonds for transportation facilities, which would include trackage and rail facilities, if 80 percent of the cargo transported on the tracks is to and from the port, which is otherwise eligible for the issuance of tax-free bonds. Additionally, the facility must be publicly owned. This bill will reduce the cost of the corridor's construction by approximately $200 million.  Currently, to handle the cargo going in and out of the ports, according to the Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority, the San Pedro Bay ports now generate approximately 20,000 truck trips and 29 train movements per day. By the year 2020, truck traffic is projected to increase to 49,000 daily trips and 97 daily train movements.  Today, three railroads on three separate tracks serve the San Pedro Bay ports, with 90 miles of track and over 200 grade crossings between the ports and inland cargo dispersal sites. Santa Fe's railroad alone has 92 crossings within a 20 mile span. Trucks carrying goods from the ports to dispersal sites farther inland face numerous stops and traffic.  With the projected increase in trade and cargo transport needs, the current transportation system will simply be inadequate to handle future demands.  The Alameda corridor project would consolidate the existing railways into a single corridor that would be depressed, and all crossing streets would bridge over the top. This would avoid the terrible delays as a result of the grade crossings. The corridor would also accommodate truck traffic. Make no mistake, the Alameda corridor is a project of national significance.  The benefits of constructing the corridor will go far beyond the Los Angeles region, and well beyond the California borders. Every State in this Nation is impacted by the trade along the Pacific rim, and thus by the activities of Pacific ports. Trucks and trains must move the goods out of the ports. Workers must unload the goods from ships, put them on trains or trucks, and then once they arrive at a destination, more workers must unload these goods, before they are delivered to their final stop. Trade creates jobs in every sector of the economy.  Put simply, trade means jobs.  All of the Nation's coastal States understand the importance of trade, seagoing trade in particular. In 1992, the last year for which statistics are available, this Nation exported $158.4 billion worth of goods through its seaports, and imported $293.1 billion of goods through the same ports of entry.  The San Pedro Bay ports are the busiest containerport facility in the world. Combined, $109 billion worth of cargo moved through the Los Angeles and Long Beach Ports. Trade on the Pacific rim is only expected to grow.  We must be able to support the projected growth in international commerce, and the development of the Alameda corridor will help us insure that we do so.                                 ______      By
