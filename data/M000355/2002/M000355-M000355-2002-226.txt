 SCHUMER. When I finish. The groups who represent lots of these people, who I daresay know more about their lives and their abilities to meet the requirements of this bill than either he or I do, say the lengthy list, which the Senator read, does not work. I ask the Senator if they believe, which I do, too, that signature, which has worked in my State without any large reports of fraud, will make it easier for these people to vote, these people who live in the corners of America to vote, why is adding that in so significant that it would, in the words of the Senator from Kentucky, bring down the bill?  Yes, I posit to the Senator from Kentucky that there are lots of people who cannot meet the requirements in this section of the bill. If we did not believe that, we would not be offering this amendment.  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a further question?
