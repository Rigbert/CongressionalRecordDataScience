Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, the reason that this amendment does not include the local courts in Puerto Rico and the territories is that those courts are not created by Act of Congress, so residents of Puerto Rico and the territories will be able to file suits regarding the Pledge in the courts that have been created by their respective legislatures pursuant to the organic Act that Congress has previously passed.
