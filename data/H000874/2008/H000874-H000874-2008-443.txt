As he and I have discussed and as he knows, I am disappointed that we are not in conference on the FISA bill. The Senate has not yet passed its version of the FISA bill. As you know, we passed the FISA bill in December. I think it was early December, as a matter of fact. And we understand that the legislation we passed last August has an expiration date of February 1 and that, therefore, we will either be acting under the old law, an extended law, or a revision that we might pass.  The leader of the Senate, Harry Reid, has talked about perhaps a 30-day extension. I have not talked to him about that personally, but I know that they are considering that. I also know that it is the Senate's intention to address this issue upon their return next week. As you know, they will be in most of the week next week, I think, so we will have to see probably the end of next week where the other body is so that we might better judge where we need to be.
