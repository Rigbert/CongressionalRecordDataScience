President, at the end of July, the administration transmitted to the Senate and the House of Representatives legislation intended to increase privacy and security in cyberspace. Today, at the request and on behalf of the Administration, I introduce this legislation, the Enhancement of Privacy and Public Safety in Cyberspace Act.  The White House Chief of Staff, John Podesta, announced the administration's cyber-security proposal in an important speech at the National Press Club on Monday, July 17, 2000. This is a complex area that requires close attention to get the balance among law enforcement, business and civil liberties interests just right. I welcome the Administration's participation in this debate on the privacy implications of government surveillance, which certainly deserves just as much attention as the issue of the collection and dissemination of personally-identifiable information by the private-sector.  The means by which law enforcement authorities may gain access to a person's private ``effects'' is no longer limited by physical proximity, as it was at the time the Framers crafted our Constitution's Fourth Amendment right of the American people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures. New communications methods and surveillance devices have dramatically expanded the opportunities for surreptitious law enforcement access to private messages and records from remote locations.  One example of these devices is the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Carnivore software program, which screens Internet traffic and captures information targeted by court orders. The Senate and House Judiciary Committees have both conducted hearings on Carnivore to discuss how the software works and whether it minimizes intrusion or maximizes the potential for government abuse. The Attorney General is arranging for an independent technical review of Carnivore, and I look forward to reviewing the results.  In short, new communications technologies pose both benefits and challenges to privacy and law enforcement. The Congress has worked successfully in the past to mediate this tension with a combination of stringent procedures for law enforcement access to our communications and legal protections to maintain their privacy and confidentiality, whether they occur in person or over the telephone, fax machine or computer. In 1968, the Congress passed comprehensive legislation authorizing government interception, under carefully defined circumstances, of voicecommunications over telephones or in person in Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act.  We returned to this important area in 1986, when we passed the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), which I was proud to sponsor, that outlined procedures for law enforcement access to electronic mail systems and remote data processing systems, and that provided important privacy safeguards for computer users.  The Administration's legislation is an important contribution to the ongoing debate over the sufficiency of our current laws in the face of the exponential growth of computer and communications networks. In fact, this legislation contains some proposals which I support. For example, the bill would allow judicial review of pen register orders so the judge is not just a rubber stamp, and would update the wiretap laws to apply the same procedural rules to e-mail intercepts as to phone intercepts.  Nevertheless, the merits of other provisions in this legislation would benefit from additional scrutiny and debate. For example, the legislation proposes elimination of the current $5,000 threshold for large categories of federal computer crimes. This would lower the bar for federal investigative and prosecutorial attention with the result that lesser computer abuses could be converted into federal crimes.  Specifically, federal jurisdiction currently exists for a variety of computer crimes if, and only if, such criminal offenses result in at least $5,000 of aggregate damage or cause another specified injury, such as the impairment of medical treatment, physical injury to a person or a threat to public safety. Elimination of the $5,000 threshold would criminalize a variety of minor computer abuses, regardless of whether any significant harm results. Our federal laws do not need to reach each and every minor, inadvertent and harmless hacking offense--after all, each of the 50 states has its own computer crime laws. Rather, our federal laws need to reach those offenses for which federal jurisdiction is appropriate. This can be accomplished, as I have done in the Internet Security Act, S. 2430, which I introduced earlier this year, by simply adding an appropriate definition of ``loss'' to the statute.  Prior Congresses have declined to over-federalize computer offenses and sensibly determined that not all computer abuses warrant federal criminal sanctions. When the computer crime law was first enacted in 1984, the House Judiciary Committee reporting the bill stated:       The Federal jurisdictional threshold is that there must be      $5,000 worth of benefit to the defendant or loss to another      in order to concentrate Federal resources on the more      substantial computer offenses that affect interstate or      foreign commerce. (H.Rep. 98-894, at p. 22, July 24, 1984).  Similarly, the Senate Judiciary Committee under the chairmanship of Senator Thurmond, rejected suggestions in 1986 that ``the Congress should enact as sweeping a Federal statute as possible so that no computer crime is potentially uncovered.'' (S. Rep. 99-432, at p. 4, September 3, 1986).  For example, if an overly-curious college sophomore checks a professor's unattended computer to see what grade he is going to get and accidentally deletes a file or a message, current Federal law does not make that conduct a crime. That conduct may be cause for discipline at the college, but not for the FBI to swoop in and investigate. Yet, under the Administration's legislation, this unauthorized access to the professor's computer would constitute a federal offense.  As the Congress considers changes in our current laws with a view to updating our current privacy safeguards from unreasonable government surveillance, I commend the administration for focusing attention on this important issue by transmitting its legislative proposal.  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3083       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
