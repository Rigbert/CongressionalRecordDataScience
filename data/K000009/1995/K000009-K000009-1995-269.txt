Speaker, my inquiry has to do with the courtesy extended to Members who are attempting to deliver their 1-minute messages this morning. I notice that Members on the other side are moving around the podium and placing their papers there, distracting from the individual who is speaking. Now this side has not chosen to use those tactics.  My inquiry is as to appropriate behavior when another Member of the House is addressing the public.
