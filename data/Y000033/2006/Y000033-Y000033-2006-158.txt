Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.  I thank the gentleman, again, for his presentation. I am glad he gave us an additional 2 years because the way I record it we have been in power for 12 years, not 14 years. I would gladly take two more. Maybe that is an omen of this next election, but I am just saying we have actually been going on 12 years.  Lastly, let us say this is not about the action itself. It is about legislating on appropriation, but I do, and ask you sincerely, I do not have jurisdiction with that committee. Thank God, I do not really run the White House, but I think we have to legitimately and not respond to the fear tactic. Read the book, Controlled By Fear. It is very interesting you can frighten people into doing most anything, including taking away the economy and the opportunity for future generations, easily done.  That is what I do not want us to fall into. If we are the driving factor, I am willing to accept that responsibility and do something of it, but again, go back to the history of this globe and what has occurred. It is ironic when I go into many of these States and I see seashells at 11,000 feet, seashells. This continent was covered with water at one time, retreated and allowed humanity to grow. Now, keep that in mind. Do not keep getting caught in the idea that everything that is here now is permanent. The Earth is a natural, evolving phenomenon.  That is all I am asking people to do. It is not to be caught into the fear and driving and say it is all our fault what is occurring. If that is the case through such studies, then let us accept that, but right now it has not been proven. There is a large division that says this is not happening because of humanity.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
