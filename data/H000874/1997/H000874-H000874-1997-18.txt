Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time, and I thank her for her time.  I ask those on both sides of the aisle to listen to what I have to say and recall that I said that I did not believe that this matter was being handled fairly. Let me read to Members a letter dated October 22, sent to the Clerk of the House, which to this very hour the minority has not yet received, but Members will find it interesting. That letter is on the stationery of Hart, King and Coldren, a professional law corporation. They represent Mr. Dornan. Mr. Dornan, under the Federal Contested Election Act, is the contestant in this case. We have lost sight of the fact that the act requires the contestant to carry the case, not the committee.  In any event, Mr. Speaker, this is a three-page letter in which it sets forth 14 items that have been forwarded to the committee. The minority has not yet received it. They are depositions that should have been forwarded to the committee months ago by the Dornan counsel. Custodian of records, Fidelity Federal, dated 3/24/97, 3/25/97, 3/27/97, 3/31, 4/14, 5/28. These are not newly acquired records by the Dornan case.                              {time}  2145  My colleagues, listen to this paragraph, listen to it well. This is from the contestant under the Federal Contested Election Act. By copy of this letter to the contestee's counsel, we are advising the contestee that we consider contestant's record to be complete so that she may file her brief within the time permitted by the act. Even Mr. Dornan believes this case, from an evidentiary standpoint, is now at an end. Even Mr. Dornan's counsel says this case is at an end from his perspective.  The chairman of the committee said in debate last week, or 2 weeks ago, last week I believe it was, and has reiterated today on the floor of the House, that if we would only sign a confidentiality agreement, we could get the material. He reiterated that just now.  My colleagues, no one on the majority side of the aisle, save only an affidavit of confidentiality with respect to a particular deposition, no one on the majority side signed a confidentiality agreement until October 27, 1997. Notwithstanding that, we were refused access to information because we had not signed a similar confidentiality agreement. That is the unfairness in this case.  And I ask my friend from California in particular, if he will listen, because I respect his judgment and his fairness, as I do others on this side of the aisle.  So Mr. Dornan has said, I am through, finished, it is time for Ms. Sanchez to file a reply brief. Mr. Dornan has not filed, interestingly enough, his own brief required under the Federal Contested Election Act. My supposition is that he believes a brief is not required by him. My further supposition is because he believes that committee is now carrying the case.  I want to bring to the attention as well, because the chairman is very concerned about accurate information, that the chairman indicated that there have been many cases that have gone on longer than this. My colleagues, no case, and there have been 28 of them, in the history of the Federal Contested Election Act, has gone longer than this one if we do not resolve it before we adjourn in committee.  There have, in fact, been cases which have been carried over and disposed of on the floor. In fact, the Rose case was held for almost a year between the time under the 104th Congress when the committee disposed of the case and when the committee brought it to the floor for final disposition, which was, of course, at that point in time noncontroversial. No case in the history of the Federal Contested Election Act has gone longer than this one if we do not dispose of it by the date we adjourn this first session of this Congress.  My colleagues, this case, according to Mr. Dornan, is ready to close, and I suggest to my colleagues that Mr. Dornan has not filed a brief because he knows that he has not done what is required under the statute, showed thatbut for certain factors occurring, he would have been elected to Congress. That simply has not occurred, and having not occurred, the committee has not brought to this floor any request to take action to dispose of this case based upon Mr. Dornan's making that case.  Now, my colleagues, there is a question which the gentleman from California [Mr. Thomas] raises. There is nobody on this floor who either sanctions or wants to hide the fact that voters may have voted without being citizens and may have voted illegally. That, in and of itself, is worthy of an investigation, but it is clearly a much broader investigation than the case that Mr. Dornan brought against the gentlewoman from California [Ms. Sanchez], the sitting Member of Congress from the 46th Congressional District.  So that, in fairness, I say it is time to end this case. Mr. Dornan, in his letter of October 22 through counsel, says he is through. But it is now Ms. Sanchez' chance to reply, but she has very little to reply to because Mr. Dornan has not made his case.  I would ask the Members of this House, as they reflect upon this case, think of themselves. Each and every one of us could be in the same situation. Each and every one of us could have the opposite party being in control of the House and a contestant coming forward and saying, I have certain suspicions, certain allegations that I will file, but in 12 months, essentially from November of 1996 until November of 1997, I have not been able to make my case.  Think, if my colleagues were in that situation, if they would not expect their 434 colleagues to say under those circumstances it is time to end this case, it is time to dismiss the contestant's action because he has not, as required by the statute, made his case.  If our oath means something, to defend the Constitution, it clearly means that we should defend the right of each district to elect a Member and to have that election sustained unless it is shown, pursuant to law, that but for certain things happening, the election would have turned out differently.  I would hope that all of us would come to a conclusion and urge the committee to end this matter, to move on, to say to the voters in the 46th District there will be an election shortly, Mr. Dornan says he is going to run, that election will be contested. I believe the committee should and will continue its investigation into any wrongdoing. Clearly, the district attorney is doing that; clearly, the secretary of state is doing that; they are the appropriate authorities.  Let us bring this case to close and bring it to a close now.
