Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 50th anniversary of American Legion Post 642--the Przybylski Post--in Toledo OH. The post is celebrating the occasion on Sunday, October 6, 1996. As part of this golden anniversary celebration, the post's adjutant has announced that the members and families of American Legion Post 642 will ``honor the founding and present members for the American endeavor and patriotism which have sustained the post for so long.'' To mark this auspicious occasion, we recall the ``American Creed,'' penned by William Tyler Page.       I believe in the United States of America as a Government      of the people, by the people, for the people; whose just      powers are derived from the consent of the governed; a      democracy in a republic, a sovereign Nation of     many sovereign States; a perfect Union one and inseparable;      established upon those principles of freedom, equality,      justice, and humanity for which American patriots sacrificed      their lives and fortunes. I therefore believe it is my duty      to my country to love it, to support its Constitution, to      obey its laws, to respect its flag, and to defend it against      all enemies.  The men and women of American Legion Post 642 have vigilantly upheld the tenets of the ``American Creed'' to a superior degree. For remaining true to these precious beliefs in times of battle and in times in peace, we thank them, and we honor their strength.                          ____________________
