Speaker, I rise today to continue my critique of the Clinton-Gore Administration's role in the recent surge in gasoline and home-heating oil prices. Yes, Mr. Speaker, the Administration must shoulder much of the responsibility because they ignored the ``two D's''--domestic production and diplomacy.  The United States imports around 55% of its petroleum requirements largely because it is so difficult to produce petroleum in this country. Mr. Speaker, the Administration imposes serious limits on exploration, drilling and refining oil through a Byzantine permitting and regulatory scheme. These regulations force many facilities to shut down when oil prices are low and make it uneconomical to reopen when prices rise.  This takes us to the second D--diplomacy. The Administration knew one year ago that these prices were coming down the pipeline. Unfortunately, Energy Secretary Richardson was preoccupied by a major spy scandal at DOE--as he himself said on February 16th, ``It is obvious that the federal government was not prepared. We were caught napping. We got complacent.''  The Administration was unable or unwilling to convince our friends in OPEC and other oil-producing countries to keep the spigot turned on. It is this lack of effort that brings us to where we are today--gasoline prices racing towards $2.50 a gallon.  The only thing that saved our seniors in the Northeast from freezing recently was the arrival of warmer weather. Now those living on fixed incomes will face exorbitant prices at the gas pump. That is the legacy of Clinton-Gore.  Mr. Speaker, I give this Administration's ``two D's'' and an ``F.''                          ____________________
