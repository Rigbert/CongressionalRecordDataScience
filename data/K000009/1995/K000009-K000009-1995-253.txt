The gentleman is correct. I kept listening to the President when he said, ``Oh, this is not anything serious. This is just cosigning a loan.'' I would say to the gentleman from Oregon and the gentleman from Vermont what if someone came up to you and said, ``Would you sign a loan with me for $50,000? Right now, sign it?''
