Speaker, Congress is being pushed to pass a Bush administration plan to write a blank check to white collar criminals of the highest order. Instead of prosecuting those who stole from us, Secretary Paulson wants us to reward his former colleagues for their bad decisions, abusive and unlawful practices.  While my constituents are struggling to pay their gas bills, we should recall fondly the record annual bonuses Secretary Paulson's alma mater, Goldman Sachs, gave less than 2 years ago. In 2006, that investment house alone paid $16.5 billion in compensation to its employees averaging more than $600,000 per employee. In fact, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein got $53.4 million that year. And Bear Stearns chief executive officer, the company that the Fed just bailed out with our money, James E. Cayne, got a stock bonus that year worth $14.8 million. Merrill Lynch chief executive officer Stanley O'Neal, he got $35.4 million. Think about this America.  Now 2 years later, those houses are demanding that our taxpayers bail out their companies, despite the fact that the real median household income of a middle class family in our country is about $50,000 a year. That doesn't matter to the people drafting this bailout.  In 2006, Forbes Magazine estimated Secretary Paulson earned $16.4 million as CEO of Goldman Sachs, not counting all his other perks. His net worth is estimated somewhere over half a billion dollars. Indeed, that tidy amount alone would make a real dent in what is owed to the American people in this proposed bailout.  So why would our middle class taxpayers be asked to bail out billionaires? Some of them should be doing time for insider trading and fraudulent accounting rather than lobbying down here in Washington for us to bail them out.  American taxpayers were forced to lay out $30 billion to help Bear Stearns.                              {time}  2245  And then we were asked to shell out the first $200 billion, and that could rise to $2.44 trillion, for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And now, $85 billion to rescue AIG Insurance Company.  Who ever heard of the Federal Government rescuing an insurance company that was already paying, get this, civil fines in New York for its wrongdoing of over $1.6 billion on proven charges of serious accounting fraud and misconduct.  Why send our hardened paychecks to the very people who caused these problems?  Americans don't need to write checks. We need investigations, and we don't need just investigations, we need prosecutions. White collar crimes of this magnitude cannot go unpunished, nor can they get rewarded.  First, investigation. We need the American people's voices to be heard, not just the voices of those who perpetrated these crimes against us, the taxpayers. We need real congressional investigation and oversight in each of the committees of jurisdiction which seem strangely silent here, using their subpoena power, the Judiciary Committee, the Ways and Means Committee, the Energy and Commerce Committee, the Budget Committee, the Financial Services Committee, which is having a perfunctory hearing tomorrow, I guess, and Government Oversight. The silence is deadening.  The crimes of Wall Street will make Watergate look like penny-ante thieves.  Second, campaign reform. Get the Wall Street money out of congressional and presidential races. Wall Street is now the Number 1 top source of Federal campaign money to Congress and in those presidential races. And guess who's the Number 1 Wall Street giver? Goldman Sachs. And guess where our last two Treasury Secretaries have come from? Goldman Sachs.  Whether it's a Democratic administration or a Republican, not one lawmaker or candidate should be accepting Wall Street money. Wall Street is so broke as to beg for our help, but somehow they have millions of dollars to drop into political coffers.  I think the American people are beginning to get the picture. In fact, I'm putting in the Record tonight an article from the Wall Street Journal called Wall Street Top Source of Campaign Money, and also a list of the biggest donors on Wall Street.  Mr. Speaker, I will continue tomorrow evening to talk about justice and empowering the Department of Justice to institute a major investigation.  And let me also, in closing say, I'm going to be placing in the Record tonight some remarks from Americans who have ideas about what should be done.  I want to compliment the American people. You're doing a lot of thinking on your own. We need to hear from you.  This Congress shouldn't be closing down and going home. We should betaking care of America's business, not going home to campaign.             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 23, 2008]               Wall Street Is Top Source of Campaign Cash                     Wallets Open Up on Wall Street                           (By Brody Mullins)       Despite Wall Street's recent woes, people who work in the      financial industry continue to dig deep for political      donations to Republican and Democratic candidates for      president.       Employees of Wall Street firms are the single largest      source of campaign cash, accounting for a total of $50.4      million in financial contributions to the candidates so far      this election cycle. That is more than any other industry      sector, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of      campaign-finance data compiled by the nonpartisan Center for      Responsive Politics.       As candidates load up for advertising blitzes before      ``Super Tuesday'' primaries on Feb. 5, candidates from both      parties are again coming to New York seeking campaign      donations. Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican, had a      fund-raiser at the St. Regis Hotel last night that was hosted      by Merrill Lynch & Co. Chief Executive John Thain, private-     equity giant Henry Kravis of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.      and former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chairman John Whitehead.       Mr. McCain recently spent $1 million on advertising ahead      of the Florida primary next Tuesday, Voters in more than 20      states, including California and New York, go to the polls      Feb. 5.       New York Sen. Hillary Clinton heads to her home state      tomorrow for two fund-raisers. The Clinton campaign hopes to      raise $15 million through these and other means to fund her      campaign through Feb. 5.       Contributions from Wall Street have favored Republicans,      who have collected 54% of donations from financial companies.      Wall Street is the No. 1 source of donations to every major      presidential candidate in both parties, except former North      Carolina Democratic Sen. John Edwards, who is favored by the      legal industry, according to the data.       Lawyers and lobbyists are the second-largest source of      contributions to the candidates, with $34.8 million in      donations. Together, the finance and legal industries are      responsible for nearly a quarter of the $354 million donated      to the presidential candidates as of Sept. 30. The next round      of campaign-finance information, covering the three-month      period ending Dec. 31. will be released at the end of the      month.       Employees of financial firms, lawyers and lobbyists make up      46% of all large donations--contributions of $200 or more--to      the presidential candidates. Each of the other industry      sectors is responsible for just a fraction of the donations      to the candidates.       According to the data, people who work in Hollywood,      communications or electronics rank a distant third with $13.3      million in donations to the candidates. Other top sources of      donations were employees of the health-care industry with      $9.5 million, construction with $6.1 million and energy with      $3.1 million. People who work in the defense industry gave      $502,000, according to the data.       Not surprisingly, the two candidates from New York are      winning the race for donations on Wall Street. Mrs. Clinton      and former New York City Republican Mayor Rudy Giuliani lead      with $12.3 million and $10.6 million, respectively, in      campaign donations from employees of Wall Street firms       Employees of Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.      and Morgan Stanley rank as the top individual sources of      donations to the presidential candidates, according to the      data.       Goldman employees were the largest contributor to Mr.      Obama, the second-largest giver to Mrs. Clinton and the      fifth-largest to Mr. Edwards. Goldman employees donated      $369,000 to Mr. Obama and $350,000 to Mrs. Clinton.       Other top Wall Street givers to Mr. Obama include employees      of Lehman Brothers ($229,000), J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.      ($217,000) and Citigroup Inc. ($181,000).       The top seven companies that have produced the most money      for Mr. Giuliani are all financial firms, including Ernst &      Young LLP, hedge fund Elliott Management and Credit Suisse      Group.       Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney also has fared well      on Wall Street. A founder of Bain Capital, Mr. Romney has      scored with employees of Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and      Morgan Stanley. Employees of his former company have donated      $112,000 to his campaign, according to the data.       Unlike Wall Street, lawyers heavily favor Democrats with      their political donations. Lawyers have donated $9.6 million      to Mrs. Clinton, $8.2 million to Mr. Edwards and $7.9 million      to Mr. Obama.       Mr. Giuliani, a former prosecutor and partner with      Bracewell & Giuliani LLP, raised $3.2 million from others in      his profession. That was more than any other Republican but      less than half as much as the leading Democratic candidates.       Pennsylvania-based law firm Blank Rome LLP was the top      source of donations to Mr. McCain, who collected $141,000      from employees of the firm. Mr. McCain fared well with      employees of Greenberg Traurig LLP, a Miami firm that ranks      as his third-largest contributor. As the chairman of the      Senate Indian Affairs Committee, Mr. McCain took the lead in      investigating convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who was a      lobbyist with Greenberg Traurig.       Mr. McCain and Mrs. Clinton led all others with donations      from lobbyists. Mrs. Clinton collected $568,000 from      lobbyists, while Mr. McCain has $340,000.                                  ____             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 15, 2008]                   The Biggest Donors on Wall StreetCrunched by Credit Crisis Financial Firms Still Find Cash for Campaign                                Donations                           (By Brody Mullins) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           Total Given to             2008 Donor                  Overall Rank     Both Candidates     Total to Obama    Total to McCain----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------AT                 20           $309,391           $135,834           $173,557Bank of America.....................                 17           $336,377           $206,902           $129,475Citadel Investment Group............

Henry, Esq.       Date: September 23, 2008       Based on our our conversations this morning with several      thoughtful observers here are some additional specific ideas      for improving the Paulson Plan.       The overall perspective is that Congress should concentrate      now on a short list of     crucial improvements to the Plan that are most important to      the public. In our view, these are the following:       1. Equity ``Upside'' and Voting Power. In return for the      undeniable new risks that US taxpayers are taking on, and the      poor management track record of leading Wall Street      institutions, it is reasonable to insist that they receive an      ``upside'' on the value of participating financial      institutions (FIs) themselves as well as on the potential      increased value of acquired mortgage-backed assets. This      proposal commands widespread support in this panel.       Technically, this could be accomplished by demanding      preferred shares (with anti-dilution provisions) from any      financial institutions (FIs) that receive assistance, as was      routinely done by Bank of Japan in exchange for financial      assistance during the Japanese bank restructuring of the      1990s, and by the Chilean government during the February 1983      bank nationalization.       Warrants might also be used, as was done in the case of the      1979 $1.2 billion Treasury loan guarantee to Chrysler.      (According to Sen. Bradley, the Federal Government eventually      made money on those warrants.) We believe that while warrants      are easier to implement, it is vital to insist on actual      equity (including voting power). This will provide the      Treasury with much more direct influence over management      behavior, will be easier to value, and will also be easier to      explain to the public than warrants.       2. Clawback Provisions for Executive Severance Pay. The      basic principle here is that for senior FI executives, there      should be accountability for some time period even after they      leave office--at a minimum, any future compensation or      severance that they receive should be subject to stiff taxes      or repossession in bankruptcy court. Insisting on compliance      with this standard should be a condition for participation in      the bailout.       3. Share the Pain.       A. Emergency Taxes. Since this very costly bailout package      may severely limit the ability of the Federal Government to      afford vital programs like health insurance reform and      alternative energy, it is important that we deal now with the      substantial ``tax justice'' implications of the bailout.       One way to do this would be to start treating this as the      national emergency that it really is, and help ordinary      taxpayers pay for it by: (1) eliminating the carried-interest      benefits for hedge fund managers; (2) cracking down on      offshore havens--no FIs should be permitted to establish subs      or place SPVs in them; (3) imposing at least a temporary      increased income tax rate on all people with incomes above $1      million and on all estates above $10 million.       B. Compulsory Write-Down/Debt Reduction of Residential      Mortgages. Given the failure of this summer's relief packages      for ordinary mortgage holders to have much impact, and the      fact that foreclosures are still increasing (to a record      100,000+ per month, and that housing prices are still falling      in a majority of key markets, this is an another essential      measure. The debt restructuring should be implemented      quickly, affect large numbers of people, and be inversely      proportional to mortgage size. It might also be means-tested.       4. Financial Products Safety Commission. This would review      and certify the quality of all financial products offered to      the general public. Products like zero-down payment mortgages      would require special labeling, and might not qualify for      government incentives like interest deductibility, access to      the government insurance window, and so forth.       5. Treasury-Created Market for MBS Insurance. As discussed      in the draft article below, a very novel idea is that the US      Treasury might be able to use current authority to offer ABX-     like insurance at a fixed price per tranche to institutions      that hold MBSs. According to Professors Kotlikoff and Merlin,      if such a government-backed insurance market were in place,      backed by a significant reserve against losses, it might even      obviate the need for the entire $700 billion, while creating      a market-based workout alternative.       As Mr. Henry has suggested, this could be combined with #1,      if FIs were allowed to pay for the insurance with equity or      warrants. This would also have the benefit of helping to      recapitalize troubled FIs.       6. New ``Pecora Commission'' (ala 1932): a congressional      committee with subpoena power to investigate the root causes      of this crisis and recommend further steps.                                  ____                        The Right Financial Fix                                                September 21, 2008       Fortunately, the Treasury and Fed are looking for a      ``comprehensive approach to address the illiquid assets on      bank balance sheets.'' Their idea is to swap up to $700      billion in Treasuries for the ``toxic'' assets, putting a      floor on bank losses and leaving the government to hold the      risky assets until conditions improve. The big question is      the swap rate; i.e., how to price these thousands upon      thousands of illiquid securities so that both taxpayers and      bank shareowners are fairly treated.       Treasury Secretary Paulson wants to run auctions to      determine prices, but this will take time to set up and may      be impractical given the highly complex nature of many of the      securities involved. Furthermore, those holding the worst      securities will be the most eager to sell.       Our answer is to rely on the same pricing mechanism, but      not the same prices, used before things hit the fan. In the      good old days, mortgage derivatives were priced by reference      to the cost of buying default insurance on five tranches of a      bundle of 20 standard subprime mortgages. The top tranche      (AAA) provided the highest probability of full repayment. The      lowest tranche (BBB) had the lowest probability. In between      were another 3 tranches. The market for these insurance      contacts is called the ABX.       Avant le deluge, you could use ABX prices to figure out      what a given tranche of a standard mortgage-backed security      was worth. It would simply be the cost of buying a safe      bond--a Treasury--with the same coupon plus paying the ABX-     determined price for default insurance for that tranche. The      reason is that once you had purchased the insurance, you are      guaranteed a safe income stream; i.e., you were guaranteed      the equivalent of a Treasury bond. More exotic mortgage-     backed securities, with now scary initials, like CDOs, could      also be priced using the ABX.       So here's our specific idea. Rather than ask Hank Paulson      to determine the price of each and every toxic asset, let's      have him simply set prices for the ABX insurance policies (or      credit default swaps, as they are called). Right now these      insurance policies are selling for crazy prices because      nobody can insure against systemic risk. Nobody, that is,      except the government. The government is in a unique position      to insure against system-wide risk because its own decisions      determine, to a very large degree, the extent of this risk.       Were the government to start selling the ABX insurance      policies at reasonable prices, our Cinderella mortgage-     derivatives market would suddenly wake up and start pricing      every mortgage-related security in sight based on these ABX      prices. If Hank does this, the market will do essentially all      the pricing; Hank will have only a handful of prices to set,      not thousands.       But how does Hank set those prices? What's fair? What's      fair are insurance policy prices that assumes no system      collapse, a modest additional decline in house prices, a mild      recession, and modest additional increases in default rates.      Yes, these are optimistic assumptions, but that's the      economic outcome the government is arranging and it needs to      signal its resolve.       Once the five prices are set, Hank can keep the $700      billion in his pocket. The Treasury will be receiving premium      payments as it sells the ABX policies--premiums that it will      need to keep in reserve.       What will happen to the banks? With reasonable ABX      insurance prices, their toxic assets will take on reasonable      values. This will restore their balance sheets and allow them      to keep operating. Yes, this will help bank shareholders, but      they will still end up far worse off than at the beginning of      this crisis. Taxpayers will keep their $700 billion pistol      dry for another day.       Playing the ABX market-maker is step one for the      government. Step two is reorganizing banks whose capital is      still too low even when its ``toxic'' assets are revalued.      This means helping such troubled banks finding a marriage      partner. Step three is reregulating the entire financial      sector. This includes establishing a Federal Financial      Authority that stamps a seal of approval on consumer      financial products that it deems to be safe, that rates      individual securities, and that audits the books and rates      the performance of each and every one of our nation's major      companies.       The final step, and the most important, is to require      financiaI institutions to report on line and in fine detail      everything they know about the assets they hold. The      principle here is simple enough even for Wall Street      ``geniuses'' to understand. If you want to sell the public a      product, including your stock, you need to explain what it      is.                               ____________________
