 That goes back to all that we heard during the year 2001, when this nomination was presented to the Senate, going into the year 2002. There were a lot of organizations that testified against his nomination. There were a lot of accusations made. There was a lot of discussion. There were a lot of newspaper articles.  This may not be a sound way to make a judgment about whether something is right or wrong, but if I hear from the grassroots of Iowa right away about a nomination, I take that much more seriously. But most of the accusations against Tom Dorr came after there were articles in the New York Times and the Washington Post, and then interest in this nomination in the Iowa newspapers came about the same time, and the accusations that were put in place.  Then I heard something. Obviously, when you hear from your constituents against a nominee you want to take that into consideration. So then nothing happened to this nomination until the President has pushed it, during thenew Congress. In the meantime, then, Secretary Dorr has been in a position for well over a year. During that 1 year, none of the people or organizations that came out so strongly against Tom Dorr in the previous Congress has raised complaints about his doing the job that he is doing. It tells me, then, we ought to look at on-the-job performance as criteria for this person moving forward with this nomination.  That is what I ask my colleagues to do as they consider it.  I yield the floor.
