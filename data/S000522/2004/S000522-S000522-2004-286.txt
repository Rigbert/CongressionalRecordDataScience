Mr. Speaker, Easter is usually a joyous time for Christians throughout the world. Unfortunately, that was not the case this year for many Montagnards Christians, ethnic minorities in Vietnam's Central Highlands. On Saturday April 10, more than a thousand ethnic minority Christians assembled in the streets of Buon Ma Thuot to protest ongoing religious repression and confiscation of tribal lands.  Their peaceful protests were met with brutal force by the Vietnamese police, who attacked and arrested the protesters and sealed off the area to foreigners--much like the Chinese Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989.  Numerous reports state that hundreds may be dead with many others arrested, injured, and or in hiding. This follows years of ongoing persecution and a brutal crackdown in December of 2001, when the government also forcibly suppressed mass protests in the region, after which the Vietnamese government closed hundreds of Christian Churches.  Religious persecution in Vietnam against Catholics, Christians, members of the Unified Buddhist Church, and members of Vietnam's indigenous religious groups has been well documented in the State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights and International Religious Freedom.  Last year, the Commission on International Religious Freedom recommended Vietnam should be designated as a Country of Particular Concern for ``systematic, egregious, and ongoing'' religious freedom abuses. As if there was any doubt, the Easter crackdown confirms the fact that Vietnam should be designated as a Country of Particular Concern for violations in religious freedom. Protections andassistance for Montagnard asylum seekers should be provided also be provided by the Cambodian government and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.  Congress will continue to keep up the pressure on the regime in Hanoi. We will work to pass H. Con. Res. 378, a resolution calling for the release of Father Nguyen Van Ly, a prominent and outspoken Catholic priest, that was reported out of the House International Relations Committee and has nearly 90 cosponsors.  And we will also work to pass H.R. 1587, ``The Vietnam Human Rights Act,'' which calls for careful monitoring of human rights in Vietnam. Similar legislation cleared the House 410-1 in the 107th Congress but stalled in the Senate.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to submit the following articles by Human Rights Watch detailing the events of the Easter crackdown, to the Congressional Record.  The United States and the world cannot turn a blind eye to this Easter crackdown and continual persecution of Montagnards and religious groups in Vietnam. We must take a stand.                   [Article from Human Rights Watch]  Vietnam: Open Central Highlands to International Observers Reported    Killings of Montagnard Protesters Must Be Investigated Immediately       (New York, April 22, 2004)--Vietnamese security forces      appear to have coordinated with armed men in civilian      clothing to savagely attack Montagnard protesters at more      than a dozen mass demonstrations during Easter weekend, Human      Rights Watch said today.       ``The international community must act now and insist that      Vietnam allow independent observers into the highlands to      conduct a thorough and impartial investigation,'' said Dinah      PoKempner, General Counsel for Human Rights Watch. ``We've      received alarming reports that scores of protesters were      wounded during the demonstrations, and that some protesters      were beaten to death.''       Large-scale unrest involving between 10,000 and 30,000      indigenous minority Montagnards occurred in the Central      Highland provinces of Dak Lak, Gia Lai, and Dak Nong on April      10 and 11, according to Vietnam's state media and independent      accounts. Montagnard activists in Vietnam and abroad say that      their movement seeks to peacefully press for religious      freedom and return of ancestral lands in the Central      Highlands. The Vietnamese government has charged that ``anti-     government'' and ``counter-revolutionary'' elements are      inciting the Montagnards to seek a separatist state.       Human Rights Watch has received firsthand reports that      security forces and men in civilian clothing, armed with      metal bars, shovels, clubs with nails attached to them,      machetes, and chains, confronted Montagnard protesters at      more than a dozen locations leading into Buon Ma Thuot, the      capital of Dak Lak province, on the morning of April 10.      According to witnesses, the demonstrators were not armed,      although some defended themselves when attacked by throwing      stones at the police.       In twelve eyewitness accounts obtained by Human Rights      Watch, sources from seven different locations in Dak Lak, Gia      Lai and Dak Nong provinces described seeing Vietnamese      police, and civilians working with the police, beating      protesters. Vietnam's state-controlled media reported that      two protesters were killed--one from rocks thrown by other      protesters and another who was run over by a tractor driven      by Montagnards. While it is impossible to confirm the numbers      of casualties because the government is barring outside      observers from the region, to date Human Rights Watch has      received credible eyewitness accounts that at least ten      Montagnards were killed--one from a gunshot wound to the head      and the others from beatings and hundreds were wounded.       Clashes broke out at more than a dozen locations when      security forces and ethnic Vietnamese in civilian clothes      blocked demonstrators on roadways leading into Buon Ma Thuot,      including Phan Chu Trinh Road northwest of the city; at Ea      Knir Bridge on the road from Ea Kao commune, which lies east      of the city; and at three locations along the road leading to      Krong Pak district town, which lies northeast of the city,      including the Ea Pak and Krong Ana bridges. Particularly hard      hit at Phan Chu Trinh Road were 3,000 protesters from several      villages in Cu Mgar district, northwest of Buon Ma Thuot.       ``The security forces were well prepared for the      protesters,'' said PoKempner. ``They had set up ambushes at      key places such as bridges and the main roads into the city,      and assembled people dressed as civilians holding crude      weapons to block the roads and attack the protestors.''       Security officials confiscated and burned hundreds of the      farm tractors and makeshift trailers that many Montagnards      were traveling on, which had been packed with food and      supplies in preparation for several days of protests.       In Gia Lai province, Vietnamese state media reported that      demonstrators from Ayun Pa, Cu Se, Dak Doa, Duc Co and Chu      Prong districts gathered at the provincial administrative      offices in Pleiku provincial town on April 10. on April 11,      Montagnards gathered to demonstrate in numerous communes in      Ayun Pa, Cu Se, and Dak Doa districts of Gia Lai. Human      Rights Watch has received reports of clashes in at least      seventeen locations in Gia Lai, with the fiercest incidents      occurring in Ha Bau, A'Dok and Glar communes of Dak Doa      district and Ia Tiem commune of Cu Se district.       State media reported that the provincial hospital in Pleiku      received fifty-two injured people. The provincial hospital in      Dak Lak reported forty injured people on the night of April      10. Prior to a government-imposed news blackout on hospital      personnel, staff at Pleiku hospital told reporters that they      had received scores of wounded people on Sunday night, many      with deep gashes and head injuries, and that at least two      demonstrators died that night. Many other wounded      demonstrators, fearing arrest, have not gone to the hospitals      despite being in need of medical attention, Human Rights      Watch said.       Witnesses said authorities quickly collected wounded people      and dead bodies from the Phan Chu Trinh area, and that within      days, the blood on the roadway had been washed away.       Human Rights Watch stressed the urgency of an independent      investigation. ``We fear that a huge cover-up operation has      likely already taken place,'' said PoKempner. ``The      Vietnamese government needs to account for the large numbers      of people who never returned to their villages after the      demonstrations and are now feared to be dead or detained at      unknown locations.''       Hundreds of Montagnards have fled their villages and gone      into hiding, Human Rights Watch said. In violation of      Cambodia's obligations under international law, Cambodian      security forces have been instructed to deport any      Montagnards who try to cross the border.             Testimony: The Killings on Phan Chu Trinh Road       A twenty-six year old Ede woman described a deadly incident      she witnessed on Saturday morning, April 10 when several      thousand Montagnard protesters, some riding on their farm      tractors, arrived at Phan Chu Trinh road, an industrial area      of machine shops and welding supply stores on the outskirts      of Buon Ma Thuot. Police had lined up students and ethnic      Vietnamese men in civilian clothing holding metal bars,      shovels, and machetes along the roadway, she said.       ``They suddenly rushed at the unarmed crowd, beating the      demonstrators until many were lying in the streets,'' she      said. ``They chased demonstrators who tried to flee,      including children and women.''       She and many other demonstrators fled to the coffee fields      behind the shops lining the roadway, chased by security      forces. She described what happened:       ``A thousand people tried to get away from the slaughter by      the police and civilians. They were beating us with metal      bars and sticks. People were bleeding from their throats,      noses, mouths, and eyes. The villagers were crying as they      tried to get away from the slaughter by the police and      civilians. We were running helter-skelter. Those who tried to      hide in the coffee plantation were caught, beaten and killed      on the spot. Police, students, and Vietnamese threw rocks at      us. Many of us were bleeding from being hit on our heads with      rocks. Many people were injured and bleeding. We didn't have      any first-aid for their wounds. They were bleeding from their      throats, noses, mouths, and eyes. A blind woman sitting on      the farm tractor was killed on the road by a dozen Vietnamese      people, including police. They asked her to get down from the      tractor but she could not because she was blind. They rushed      at her and beat her until she fell from the tractor and died.      The police and Vietnamese civilians smashed and stepped on      our food, clothing and blankets we had prepared for a long-     term peaceful demonstration asking for freedom and the end to      harassment of our religion and our Montagnard life.''                          ____________________
