Nick Lynch was one of the most respected football coaches in Maryland, leading the Suitland High team for 12 years and taking it to two state championships.  More than his coaching success, though, Coach Lynch was set apart by his devotion to his players and outsized role in the Prince George's County community. As Suitland Principal Mark Fossett said, ``He's had an impact on so many people's lives--not only football players, but students in general. It wasn't like Nick was just the head coach of football. This is a devastating loss to our community, to our family.'' Many of his current and former players echoed that thought, speaking of Coach Lynch's commitment to shaping the lives of his players off the field, inviting them to church and meals, and acting as the caring authority figure that many of them had lacked. Keith Brown, one of Suitland's players, put it simply after Coach Lynch's memorial service: ``That's my father.''  At a service in which some mourners squeezed into stairways or sat in aisles, nearly 3,000 members of the Prince George's community gathered to honor Nick Lynch's impact on the lives of so many young men. Though Coach Lynch is gone, his influence will no doubt endure in all the lives he touched.                          ____________________
