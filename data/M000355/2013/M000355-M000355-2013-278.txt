 Jack Sizemore, an exemplary citizen of Kentucky and a genuinely good man. Mr. Sizemore, of Laurel County, was laid to rest on February 12, 2013, and is survived by his wife, 7 children, 20 grand-children, 16 great-grandchildren, and two sisters.  The words, ``let me tell you what Jack Sizemore did for me'' are commonly heard in Jack's beloved town of London, and represent just how sorely his presence will be missed. His legacy of goodwill is firmly established after years working in the Laurel County Detention Center, as he chose to build a reputation as a jailer who ``liked the job he was doing and [who] took care of the prisoners in a humane way and with the utmost courtesy.'' This testimony comes from his former supervisor Edd Parsley, who admits that ``you don't find many men like that.''  Jack was known to always have people laughing, and the community he loved so much has looked back and seen all the ways he touched their lives. The health problems that plagued his final years cannot begin to take attention away from his legacy and reputation.  At this time, I ask that my colleagues in this United States Senate join me in honoring Mr. Jack Sizemore. Along with our condolences to his friends and family, we simultaneously offer our gratitude and praise of this truly wonderful man.  I also ask unanimous consent that an article on the life and service of Mr. Jack Sizemore that appeared in the Laurel County-area publication the Sentinel Echo be included in the Record.  There being no objection, the following article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Sentinel Echo, February 15, 2013]                 Former Jailer Remembered as `Good Man'                           (By Nita Johnson)       Laurel County, Kentucky.--A former Laurel County jailer,      chief administrator of the jail, and deputy sheriff was laid      to rest on Tuesday after ongoing health problems.       Jack Sizemore, 76, died Saturday at his home from      frontotemporal dementia, which left him unable to communicate      with others. Sizemore left a legacy of goodwill for his      family, friends and co-workers.       Edd Parsley worked with Sizemore after Parsley was      appointed as jailer in 1997. Sizemore stayed on as chief      administrator of the Laurel County Detention Center when      Parsley was elected to a four-year term as jailer.       ``Jack worked for me for six years as chief administrator      of the jail, and he was one of those people that if you told      him to do something, you could very well rest assured that he      would carry it out,'' Parsley said. ``He liked the job he was      doing and he took care of the prisoners in a humane way and      with the utmost courtesy. You don't find many men like      that.''       Describing Sizemore as ``a good man,'' Parsley reviewed      Sizemore's background that made him invaluable at the jail.       ``He was experienced in law enforcement. He was a deputy      under several sheriffs,'' Parsley said. ``He realized what      had to be done and did it. He served this county well as a      jailer, chief administrator and deputy.''       Barb Rudder, who has worked in the booking department of      the jail for nearly 20 years, said Sizemore was ``a good      person to work with.''       ``He always used to have people laughing and he would tell      everyone that I was his babysitter.''       After Sizemore retired, Rudder said she visited him during      his illness the past two years.       ``It's a sad loss for the community and for his family,''      she said.       That loss is indeed sad for Madgel Miller, who was one of      Sizemore's stepchildren.       ``Jack was my stepdad, but we didn't use `step' in our      family,'' Miller said. ``He had seven kids, 20 grandchildren,      16 great-grandchildren, some of whom were step. But step was      never considered in the family.''       Sizemore faced several health issues during the latter part      of his life, Miller said, including a quadruple bypass in      2008.       ``But he came through that very well and since he did, we      were expecting him to have a long retirement.''       But other health problems came with the frontotemporal      dementia, which affects one's communication skills.       ``It is a rare form of dementia, but he and my mother never      had a problem communicating,'' she said. ``He loved my mother      unconditionally, and they had their own form of      communicating.''       But the past several months had taken its toll on the      former jailer, and Miller said by Christmas, Sizemore was      very ill.       ``He had a rapid decline from it [dementia]. Last week, he      had a real hard time of it, and my mother made a doctor's      appointment for him,'' Miller added. ``He was in the hospital      Wednesday because the doctor said he was weak and dehydrated.      But he was able to walk in the hospital. He went home Friday      and had a good night with family, and some friends came over.      He couldn't communicate with us. He died in his sleep that      night, with Mom and me beside him.''       Choking back tears, Miller described Sizemore as a man with      ``a good heart'' who was also ``very intelligent.''       Miller said many people had come to tell the family how      Sizemore had touched their lives.       ``It was good to hear people say, `Let me tell you what      Jack Sizemore did for me,' and it was stories that he never      told. Jack was always telling stories, but these were about      what he did for people,'' Miller said. ``I remember when I      was going to college, he would tell me, `This is a good place      to raise kids. This is a good place to live.' He loved this      town.''       Hearing the impact that her father had had on the people he      dealt with during his lifetime, Miller said her opinion of      Sizemore's goodwill towards others was reinforced.       ``He was a very private person and didn't tell people about      the dementia,'' she said. ``He knew how to handle people and      how to keep his own life private and personal. We made the      arrangements quickly because he would rather be remembered in      better times. Knowing Jack Sizemore, he would have had it no      other way.''                          ____________________
