Speaker, I am not going to tell the gentleman, but it was a good fishing trip that the gentleman was on.  I thank the gentleman, but my assumption is that Members can be relatively confident, based upon what we are going to do and what you are going to do, to be out of here somewhere before 5 p.m. tomorrow; is that correct?  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I don't want to grab the exact time, but it is our anticipation, after the Rules Committee meets, that we come down and have a rules vote. We will have hours of debate, and then we will proceed with the vote, and as orderly as we can get done, we will get done by the afternoon as early as possible.
