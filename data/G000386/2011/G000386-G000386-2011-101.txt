 President, as an Iowan, it is with great sadness but also a sense of pride that I rise to pay tribute to Navy SEAL Jon T. Tumilson who gave his life for his country along with 29 other American heroes as the result of a helicopter crash in Afghanistan on August 6. He worked hard to get where he did and was extremely proud to have become a Navy SEAL. The people of the State of Iowa, and particularly his hometown of Rockford, are extremely proud to call him a native son.  Petty Officer Tumilson is described as someone who committed fully to everything he did and he applied that intense dedication to serving his country. We as a nation must be grateful that we have brave and selfless Americans like Jon Tumilson who are willing to undertake the incredible training necessary to become a Navy SEAL so that they can then put their lives on the line repeatedly in some of the most dangerous missions imaginable. Our country has lost a powerful force for good, and his fellow sailors have lost a brother in arms. Of course, his loss will be felt particularly deeply by his family, friends, and neighbors. My prayers go out to Jon's parents, George and Kathy, and all those who are grieving. Nothing can compensate for his loss, but I hope they can take comfort in knowing that he died a true American hero. Jon Tumilson's memory will now join the honored ranks of those patriots who, since the Revolutionary War, have fought to defend American liberty.                   Chief Petty Officer Robert Reeves
