 President, for the information of all Senators, on Tuesday, the Senate will convene at 11 a.m., and by previous consent immediately begin 2 hours of debate on S. 96, the Y2K legislation. Following that debate, the Senate will stand in recess for the weekly party conferences to meet. At 2:15 p.m., when the Senate reconvenes, a series of stacked votes will occur. The first votes in order will be to complete the Y2K legislation. Following disposition of that bill, a cloture vote on the Social Security lockbox issue will occur. If cloture is not invoked on the lockbox legislation, a cloture vote on H.R. 1664, regarding steel, oil, and gas appropriations, will be in order; further, if cloture is not invoked on H.R. 1664, it is the intention of the leader to resume debate on the energy and water appropriations bill. It is hoped that this appropriations bill can be completed by tomorrow evening.  As a reminder, a cloture motion to the House-passed Social Security lockbox legislation was filed today. Therefore, that cloture vote will take place on Wednesday, 1 hour after the Senate convenes, unless there is a unanimous consent agreement to change that time.                          ____________________
