 President, when the 105th Congress passed the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, TEA-21, there was a vigorous and close debate about whether to convert the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program into a race neutral program helping all small disadvantaged businesses. It troubled many members of both Houses that we lacked basic information about the characteristics of DBEs and non-DBEs and about alleged discrimination in the transportation industry. Consequently, I introduced, with widespread bi-partisan support, an amendment to TEA-21, requiring the GAO to gather the information Congress was missing that is essential to understanding the DBE program. As Congressman Shuster, Chair of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the floor manager for the transportation bill, emphasized during the House debate, the Act ``also requires a GAO study that would examine whether there is continued evidence of discrimination against small business owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. I believe such a study will lay the groundwork for future reform.''  Three years later, the GAO has produced a comprehensive report on the questions Congress asked it to investigate. This objective, impartial report entitled, ``Disadvantaged Business Enterprises: Critical Information is needed to Understand Program Impact,'' GAO Report GAO-01-586, June 2001, is highly significant to the continuing legislative and judicial debate over the DBE program. Professor George R. La Noue, one of the distinguished scholars in this field, has analyzed the GAO's report. He notes that the ``DBE program has been continuously subject to litigation during its almost two decades of existence.'' Professor La Noue concludes that ``the picture of the DBE program that emerges from the GAO report is one of essential information that is missing, or if available, does not support any finding of a national pattern of discrimination against DBEs.'' I am pleased to provide Professor La Noue's analysis of the GAO report, and I request that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:     An Analysis of ``Disadvantaged Business Enterprises: Critical           Information Is Needed to Understand Program Impact''                   GAO Report [GAO-01-586 June 2001]         (By George R. La Noue, Professor of Political Science) Director, Project on Civil Rights and Public Contracts, University of                        Maryland, Baltimore County       During the 1998 consideration of the Transportation Equity      Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), there was extensive debate      in both Houses about whether to make the DBE program race-     neutral. In the end, a compromise was reached to retain a      race conscious DBE program, while requiring the General      Accounting Office to make a three year study of the      characteristics of the DBEs and non-DBEs participating in      federal transportation programs and to gather existing      evidence of discrimination against DBEs. Such information was      intended to provide a solid basis of facts for courts,      legislators, and others grappling with the complex issues of      the constitutionality of the DBE program.       The GAO study now has been released and its conclusions are      highly significant. GAO performed its three year study by      obtaining data from 52 state DOT recipients (including the      District of Columbia and Puerto Rico) and 31 of the largest      (accounting for two-thirds of transit grant funds obligated      in 1999) transportation districts in the country. In addition      GAO staff interviewed representatives of interest groups on      both sides of the DBE question and analyzed the results of 14      transportation related disparity studies.       Following are GAO's major conclusions.                      1. Discrimination complaints       GAO conducted a survey of discrimination complaints      received by USDOT and recipients. GAO found that, while USDOT      sometimes receives written complaints of discrimination, the      agency does not compile or analyze the information in those      complaints. GAO could not supply information on the number of      complaints filed, investigations launched, or their outcomes.      (p. 33) GAO also asked state and local transit recipients      about complaints they received and they had better data.      During 1999 and 2000, 81 percent of the recipients had no      complaints, while a total of 31 complaints were received by      the other recipients. Of these, 29 were investigated and      findings of discrimination were made only 4 times across the      nation .       The report concluded: Other factors may also limit the      ability of DBEs to compete for USDOT-state assisted      contracts. The majority of states and transit districts we      surveyed had not conducted any kind of analysis to identify      these factors. Using anecdotal information, we identified a      number of factors, or barriers, such as a lack of working      capital and limited access to bonding, that may limit DBEs'      ability to compete for contracts. However, there was little      agreement among the officials we contacted on whether these      factors were attributable to discrimination. (p.7)       In fact GAO reported there were few if any studies by      government agencies or industry groups regarding barriers to      DBE contracting. ``USDOT officials, however, stated that they      believe contract bundling is one of the largest barriers for      DBEs in competing for transportation contracts.'' (p. 35)      That, of course, is not a problem caused by discrimination.                          2. Disparity studies       GAO also reviewed 14 transportation-specific disparity      studies completed between 1996 and 2000. GAO examined these      studies because they might be a source of evidence      about discrimination against DBEs and because USDOT      permits recipients to use disparity studies to set annual      goals and to determine the level of discrimination these      goals purportedly are remedying. GAO found that about 30      percent of the recipients surveyed used disparity studies      to set their fy 2000 goals. (p. 29).       GAO found that: the limited data used to calculate      disparities, compounded by the methodological weaknesses,      create uncertainties about the studies findings. . . . While      not all studies suffered from every problem, each suffered      enough problems to make its findings questionable. We      recognize there are difficulties inherent in conducting      disparity studies and that such limitations are common to      social science research; however, the studies we reviewed did      not sufficiently address such problems or disclose their      limitations. (p.29)       GAO then detailed disparity study problems, particularly in      calculating DBE availability. These problems are important      not only because they undermine the validity of the disparity      studies involved, but because these same problems exist in      the regulations USDOT issued regarding annual goal setting.      USDOT as a practical matter permits recipients to use a wide      variety of sources to measure availability on which goals are      then based.       GAO made other specific criticisms of the studies. For      example, the studies did not have information on firm      qualifications or capacities; they failed to analyze both the      dollars and contracts awarded and sometimes did not have      subcontracting data. This     was important: Because MBE/WBEs are more likely to be awarded      subcontracts than prime contracts, MBEs/WBEs may appear to be      underutilized when the focus remains on prime contractor      data. Furthermore, although some studies did include      calculations based on the number of contracts, all but two      based their determination of disparities on only the dollar      amounts of the contracts. Because MBEs/WBEs tend to be      smaller than non-MBEs/WBEs, they often are unable to perform      on larger contracts. Therefore, it would appear that they      were awarded a disproportionately smaller amount of contract      dollars. (p. 32) (see data on contracting awards on p. 51)       GAO's conclusion here is significant because the USDOT      regulations measure utilization only in dollars, not      contracts, and annual goals are set based on total dollars      rather than on the DBE share of subcontracting dollars.       Finally GAO notes that although USDOT advised recipients      that disparity studies should be ``reliable,'' USDOT provided      no guidance on what would be a reliable study. GAO concluded      that: USDOT's guidance does not, for example, caution against      using studies that contain the types of data and      methodological problems that we identified above. Without      explicit guidance on what makes a disparity study reliable,      states and transit authorities risk using studies that may      not provide accurate information in setting DBE goals. (p.      32)       GAO's finding about the unreliability of disparity studies      is consistent with the findings of every court that has      examined the merits of such studies after discovery and      trial.                       3. Discontinuing Programs       One of the arguments used in the TEA-21 debates and      defendant's trial briefs is the assertion, often anecdotal,      that without goals, DBE participation would decline      precipitously. The difficulty with that assertion, even if      true, is that the decline in DBE participation may be the      result of previous overutilization caused by goals set too      high or because when a program is struck down DBEs may have      little incentive to seek or maintain certification.       But is the basic assertion true? It turned out that 10 of      12 recipients with discontinued programs did not know what      the DBE participation result was. For instance, although      Michigan was cited by DBE proponents in the TEA-21 debate as      an example of DBE utilization decline after Michigan Road      Builders Assn. v. Millikin (1987) struck down the state      highway MBE program, GAO reports: Michigan could not provide      us with minority and women owned business participation data      in state highway contracting for the years immediately before      and after it discontinued its program. Furthermore, Michigan      officials stated that the analysis showing the decline      that is often cited was a one-time-only analysis and that      analysis is no longer available. Consequently we can not      verify the number cited during the debate (p.37)                         4. Missing information       Much of the above criticisms GAO cast in terms of a lack of      information, but there were other key items missing as well.      GAO had planned to survey all transit authorities receiving      federal funds, but FTA does not have a complete list. (p. 74)      When the 83 state and transit recipients were surveyed, only      40% or less of the respondents could report the gross      revenues of the DBEs that won contracts. Less than 25% of the      respondents could report the gross revenues of the DBEs that      did not win contracts. (pp. 52-55) Only about a third of the      agencies could report data on the personal net worth of DBE      owners, although TEA-21 regulations require that such owners      net worth not exceed $750,000.       Only a handful of respondents could report data on the      gross revenues or owner net worth characteristics of non-DBE      firms. (p. 64) While 79 respondents could report data about      subcontracts awarded DBEs, only 28 respondents could report      similar data for non-DBEs. That means that most respondents      did not regard comparing DBE and non-DBE subcontractor      utilization relevant in setting goals or in determining      whether discrimination exists.       Nor are respondents acquiring relevant information: 98.8%      have not conducted any study determining if awarding prime or      sub contracts to DBEs affects contract costs; 67.5% no study      on discrimination against DBE firms; 84.2% no study of      discrimination against DBEs by financial credit, insurance or      bond markets; 79.5% no study of factors making it difficult      for DBEs to compete; and 92.8% no study on the impact of the      DBE program on competition and the creation of jobs. (pp. 66-     68). Only 26.5% of the respondents have developed and      implemented use of a bidders list, although the regulations      require such.       The DBE program has been continuously subject to litigation      during its almost two decades of existence. Overall, the      picture of the DBE program that emerges from the GAO report      is one of essential information that is missing, or if      available, does not support any finding of a national pattern      of discrimination against DBEs.                          ____________________
