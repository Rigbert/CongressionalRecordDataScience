Chairman, I rise in reluctant opposition to the amendment offered by our good chairman.  This essentially is an effort to transfer funds from the Executive Office of the Secretary and the Common Computing Environment to different funds inside of the U.S. Department of Agriculture in operational agencies. I think it is important to point out to the membership, first of all, this is a lot of money, and it is well over $100 million.  This current fiscal year we are spending about $118 million on the Common Computing Environment. Over the years we have increased these accounts, and this year, in fact, within the budget itself there is $2,372,000 in appropriated funds being proposed over last year.  The Chairman's amendment would take those dollars and farm them out to the Farm Service Agency, the NRCS, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, and Rural Development as line items I guess in those accounts, although it is a little unclear to me how we would track this.                                  1130  But the point is, this is an account that has been rising within the executive office of the Secretary herself. I think it is important for us to keep a clear eye on how these funds are being expended.  In addition to that, there are several amendments that Members are offering today that have been cleared and filed in proper time that would take their funds from this particular account. And so the net effect of adoption of this amendment would be to force the Members who wish to offer amendments to find alternative offsets, and also to kind of lose the focus that we currently have on common computing environment in a separate account in the Secretary's office by diverting it to these many places in the agency.  So I assume that the gentleman is doing this for good reasons. But the point is I think we would have a lessening of clarity on where these funds are actually being expended by theagencies. In past years, we have had trouble with this account in really following how the administrations are spending these dollars. As we thought they were doing a little better job, we gave them additional funds.  But I really do not see the burning need for this amendment right now. There are increases in this account; and, therefore, I think in view of the negative effect it will also have on other amendments being offered here today, I would rise in opposition to the amendment.
