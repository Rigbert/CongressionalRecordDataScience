 President, I rise to honor a brave member of the U.S. Marine Corps and a fellow Kentuckian who was lost to his family and friends 45 years ago when he was killed in action in Vietnam. A very moving article in tribute to this man, CPL Lorenza Gayles, appeared in the Middlesboro Daily News recently, and I wanted to give this article and this fine young man's story the attention it deserves.  Born in Lynch, KY, on December 28, 1946, as the fourth child of David and Virginia Gayles, Lorenza moved with his family to Middlesboro as a baby and grew up with many friends. He was a good student, was popular with his schoolmates, and known for his sense of humor. His sister Lelia remembers young Lorenza was ``just a charming little boy.''  Lorenza, called ``Rennie'' by his friends, attended the Lincoln School, the only school in Middlesboro for African-American children in those days of segregation. He was a talented athlete who played football, baseball, and had an exceptional gift for basketball. Bill Smith, a longtime friend of the Gayles family, remembers Rennie as ``a solid guy with a good head on his shoulders.'' When segregation in the area ended, Lorenza went to Middlesboro High School, where he graduated in 1964.  Knoxville College offered Rennie a scholarship to play basketball after high school, but Rennie turned them down and chose to enlist with the Marine Corps instead. His older brother David was serving in the U.S. Air Force, and his brother Bobby was already in Vietnam with the Army. Within 2 years Rennie had risen to the rank of corporal and took his duties as a marine very seriously.  Alvin Simpson, a fellow Marine recruit who went through basic training with Rennie and later wrote a memoir about his experiences, said this: ``There was no question who could outfight whom; I knew, he knew, and the entire platoon knew Lorenza was the real deal.''  Corporal Lorenza Gayles was deployed to Vietnam on June 21, 1966. On September 3 of that year, while on reconnaissance patrol, he was on point with his squad when they walked into an ambush. Corporal Gayles was killed instantly. He was 19 years old.  Several weeks later his parents were presented with Corporal Gayles's posthumously awarded Purple Heart Medal. Corporal Gayles is buried in the Lynch Cemetery in Middlesboro.  ``When Rennie was killed in action in Vietnam,'' the author of this article writes, Mr. President, ``I remember my mother saying, `that poor little Gayles boy.' This is something that I have carried with me my entire life.''  That is the author of this article speaking. Forty-five years later, this author's memories still affect him, and I think anyone who reads this piece will be affected too. CPL Lorenza Gayles's life may not have been long, but he made an indelible mark on the people who love and remember him.  I ask unanimous consent that the entire article remembering CPL Lorenza Gayles, a proud marine and a brave Kentucky hero who deserves all of our respect, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       [From the Middlesboro Daily News, Sept. 2, 2011]                            Forgotten Marine       (Editor's Note: This article was written by a Daily News      reader who wishes to honor the memory of one of Middlesboro's      finest--Lorenza Gayles--yet remain anonymous.)       ``Once upon a time in America, when I was colored, two      adventurous, young boys, both black, but from very different      backgrounds; one boy was from Ky., the other boy hailed from      Northern Ohio. The kid from Ky. was killed September 3, 1966,      in South Vietnam. His name was Lorenza Gayles, he was twenty      years old when he was killed, he was my friend. I loved him      then--and I love him more today.''       --From ``Together We Served'' By Alvin L. Simpson.       To most, Rennie Gayles is a public housing development in      Middlesboro. To others, he was a son, a brother and a friend;      but most importantly to me, he was Corporal Lorenza Gayles,      United States Marine. Though I didn't know him, and was only      five years old at the time of his death, his life and death      have always held a special meaning to me.       Born in Lynch, Ky., on December 28, 1946, he was the fourth      child of David and Virginia Gayles. Soon after his birth, the      Gayles family moved to Middlesboro where he and his     older brothers and sister were raised in a loving home by      parents that worked very hard to provide for their children.      Rennie, as he was affectionately known, grew up like most of      us. He had many friends, loved playing basketball, just a      normal childhood growing up. He is described by his sister      Lelia as ``just a charming little boy.''       Rennie attended school at the Lincoln School in      Middlesboro, long since gone. In the days of segregation, it      was the only school in Middlesboro for black children. He was      a good student, very popular among his classmates and known      for his sense of humor. Bill Smith, a longtime friend of the      Gayles family, described Rennie as ``a solid guy with a good      head on his shoulders.''       Rennie was also a very talented athlete who played      football, baseball, and was an especially gifted basketball      player. With the end of segregation, he then attended      Middlesboro High School, where he graduated in 1964.       Offered a scholarship by Knoxville College to play      basketball, he declined. Instead, young Gayles enlisted in      the United States Marine Corps. With his older brother David      serving in the U.S. Air Force, and Bobby serving in Vietnam      in the U.S. Army, I suppose he felt he was obligated to      enlist. He received his basic training at Parris Island,      South Carolina, and upon completion was stationed at Camp      Lejeune, North Carolina. He later transferred to a Marine      base in California. He quickly rose through the ranks and      became a corporal in just two years. He was an attentive      soldier and took his obligation to the Corps very seriously.      He was a ``textbook'' Marine. Tough, no-nonsense and cared      deeply about those he served with.       ``Everybody in our platoon knew the outstanding recruit was      a black kid from Middlesboro, Ky., Lorenza Gayles,'' writes      Alvin Simpson, author of ``Distant Shore: A Memoir,'' and      fellow Marine recruit in basic training with Rennie.       ``There was no question who could outfight whom; I knew, he      knew, and the entire platoon knew Lorenza was the real      deal.''       With the war in Vietnam escalating, Rennie was deployed on      June 21, 1966. Just over two months after arriving in      Vietnam, while on a reconnaissance patrol, Rennie was on      point (front man in the squad) when he and the other members      of his squad walked into an ambush. He was killed instantly.                                the war       With the war in Vietnam so many years behind us, many have      tried to put it out of their minds. But for those who served      and the family members who lost loved ones there, it haunts      them every day. Deemed an unpopular war, many returning      Vietnam veterans were scorned, cursed, called ``baby      killers,'' and spat upon. The truth is, no war is popular.      War is, sometimes, just a necessary evil. This great nation      has long carried the obligation to protect and defend those      who cannot defend themselves against oppressions that exist      in this world. And to the over 58,000 soldiers that died and      1,300 still listed as missing in action, we owe our eternal      gratitude.       As a child growing up in the 1960s and early 1970s, the war      in Vietnam to me was sitting beside my father watching the      nightly news with Walter Cronkite. With the end of each      broadcast came the body count, the dead, the wounded and the      missing in action. Today, newscasts are filled with coverage      of brave men and women memorialized who have given their      lives, and those troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan      as they are met at airports across the country by cheering      crowds and hailed as heroes and glorified as they should be.      They have dedicated their lives to protect and serve this      nation as soldiers, and are prepared to give their lives for      it.       We owe the same gratitude to those who served in Vietnam.      We all know someone who served there and the memories of      these heroes are fleeting. These men and women served with      the same courage and dedication as do the brave soldiers of      today. We see them every day. Take just a moment to thank      them for their service and their sacrifice; just a pat on the      back and a thank you would mean so much. Most of all, take a      moment to remember, honor and mourn those who gave their      lives for this great nation. Our community lost too many fine      young men in Vietnam and it's up to us to pass on their      heritage so that they are not forever lost to posterity.      Remember that many of these men and women sacrificed their      ambitions so that we wouldn't have to. They died for the very      freedoms we enjoy every day.       When Rennie was killed in action in Vietnam I remember my      mother saying ``that poor little Gayles boy.'' This is      something that I have carried with me my entire life. And      with the passing of time and generations we owe it to them to      carry on their memories. This tall, handsome, young Marine      with his broad beaming smile, with his whole life ahead of      him, he was one of those men.       Rennie Gayles is not just a housing project; United States      Marine Corporal Lorenza Gayles was a guardian of freedom.                              remembrance       Forty-five years ago, on September 3, 1966, just before      your twentieth birthday, in a country, half a world away from      home, in the Quang Nam Province of South Vietnam defending      your nation with a profound sense of duty and exemplary      conduct becoming a United States Marine, you made the      ultimate sacrifice. Every day of my life I will thank God for      you, I will honor you, and I will remember you . . . Semper      Fi       On October 26, 1966, Corporal Lorenza Gayles was      posthumously awarded the Purple Heart. It was presented to      his parents by Major F.C. Fisher, U.S.M.C. Corporal Gayles is      buried in the Lynch Cemetery in Middlesboro.       Sincerest appreciation to those who contributed to this      article: Rennie's brother, Bobby Gayles of Middlesboro; Bill      Smith, U.S. Army (Ret.), of Middlesboro; sister Lelia Gayles-     Cammon, Tuscaloosa, Alabama; Alvin L. Simpson of Columbus,      Ohio, for your friendship, encouragement, service to our      nation and loving tribute to your friend; and a special      thanks to Sgt.
