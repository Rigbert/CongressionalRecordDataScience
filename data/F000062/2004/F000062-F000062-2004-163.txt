 President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of the greatest writers the world has ever known: William Shakespeare. As you may well know, this week marks the 440th birthday of the great author and playwright. As a foremost literary talent of his and every age thereafter, his works have stood the test of time and are still widely celebrated over four centuries later.  Scholars credit William Shakespeare with authoring 37 plays and 154 sonnets over the course of his life. These works continue to both move and entertain today, as they did the people of his time. His plays can be found performed daily the world round in their traditional fashion, and many of his works have been adapted to accommodate modern issues and themes. As a result, his genius and creative achievement have transcended time and touched people of all generations.  I am proud that my State of California shares a large population who take the time to celebrate the life and work of Shakespeare. California is home to some of the largest organizations dedicated to nourishing their communities through both artistic endeavors and educational programs celebrating the Bard's work. Combined, California Shakespeare festivals perform for more than 95,000 Californians annually.  It is my pleasure to congratulate the California Shakespeare Festival on celebrating their 30th anniversary this year. Beginning with a few Berkeley residents performing ``Hamlet'' to local community members, the California Shakespeare Festival has developed into a successful production company that runs four Shakespearian theaters. Through their Artistic Learning Initiative, the festival seeks to inspire and educate young artists of all backgrounds through the gift of Shakespeare's works.  Since 1983, when I was mayor of San Francisco, the San Francisco Shakespeare Festival has brought the works of Shakespeare to large and diverse audiences through their Free Shakespeare in the Park program. In cooperation with the Oakland-East Bay and Silicon Valley Shakespeare Festivals, the San Francisco Shakespeare Festival brings innovative and inspiring professional performances to over 50,000 each summer.  I also recognize the contributions of the American Friends of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust to bringing the legacy of William Shakespeare to Washington, DC, with their gift of eight sculptures to the Folger Shakespeare Library. Sculpted by artist Greg Wyatt, the eight pieces are half-size replicas of the Shakespearian-inspired artwork in the Great Garden in Stratford-upon-Avon.  I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating Shakespeare's birthday and the inspirational and lasting works he contributed to our world. William Shakespeare's poems and plays continue to inspire countless generations of young writers, further the world's love of the written word as well as performances, and reminds us all to ``be not afraid of greatness.''                          ____________________
