Mr. Chair, I rise today as a cosponsor of this important amendment and urge of all of my colleagues to support it. I thank the Gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for his tireless advocacy on addressing human rights issues, and I would like to recognize Cindy Buhl on his staff and Jamila Thompson in my office for their hard work on this issue.  The McGovern-Sestak-Bishop-Lewis amendment would allow public access to the names of graduates and instructors at the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation formerly known as the School of the Americas. This military institution, based at Ft. Benning in Georgia, is known throughout the region for its questionable teachings and record of its graduates.  This amendment is simply about transparency. By revealing the names of the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation attendees, we can shine the light of accountability and truth on an institution that is unnecessarily shrouded in secrecy. We can show our regional neighbors that we seek to be their partners in peace, and not coconspirators of aggression.  I urge all of my colleagues to support the McGovern-Sestak-Bishop-Lewis amendment. Mr. Chair, with this amendment we can show that the intentions of the United States reflect a more cooperative foreign policy and a renewed commitment to international human rights standards.                          ____________________
