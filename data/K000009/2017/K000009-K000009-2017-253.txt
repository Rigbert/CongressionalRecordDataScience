Speaker, with deepest regret and gratitude for his precious and sacrificial life, I wish to include in the Record a tribute to the earthly life of Cardinal Lubomyr Husar, a worldwide pillar of holiness, unity, and righteousness. Remembered for his unwavering commitment to defeat tyranny in Ukraine and beyond, we honor his legacy as an indomitable defender of global harmony and respect for life.  Cardinal Husar's tireless dedication to his faith helped revive the spirit of an aching people. In an era fraught with division and tensions, he fought to preserve Greek Orthodoxy in Ukraine, using its teachings to restore the identity and morale of the nation, and to inspire millions beyond.  As he worked to bridge the fissures of a divided world, Cardinal Husar courageously sought to remedy the upheaval of the last century. Cardinal Husar welcomed John Paul II back to a former Soviet republic for the first time in a thousand years and helped strengthen global interfaith cooperation. I was privileged to be present at that magnificent and grand occasion during which a mass was offered in open fields outside Kyiv, hundreds of chalices gleamed in the sun as the eastern and western Catholic traditions opened the event to people of all traditions.  The Catholic Church in Poland was the vault of national memory and identity during the 123 years the nation was temporarily erased from the European map. Similarly, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church led the archival documentation of Ukraine's national identity and aspiration during the decades Stalin tried to starve Ukraine into defeat. Stalin's efforts to erase the Ukrainian language, history and culture, failed because of the Church's preservation.  Cardinal Husar championed and supported the establishment of the Ukrainian Catholic University's development in Lviv. Astoundingly, it is the only Catholic institution of higher learning in the former Soviet space, a credit to Cardinal Husar's leadership. Even today, it remains one of the pillars of higher education in Ukraine, uncorrupted by the grim Soviet legacy.  An enlightened figure, his temperance and compassion instilled significant progress in the greater reconciliation efforts underway.  A national symbol, Cardinal Husar guided his homeland through an era of great uncertainty, as it struggled to shed the horrors of the past and regained independence with the historic opportunity to build forward toward an open and more democratic society, and vital crossroads between East and West. Driven by his own internal moral compass, his teachings helped to usher in a new era of freedom and unity. He exuded eternal hope for his newly emancipated people. For the Cardinal, freedom itself was more than liberty; ultimately, it provided him ``the opportunity to do good.''  The last time I had the privilege of speaking with Cardinal Husar, his vision was failing him. But he was completely lucid and urged me to always maintain hope for the future. When he exited the meeting, he proceeded up the stairwell of his residence with a lit candle in hand. That flame continues to burn bright in his memory.  Cardinal Husar's teachings have preserved a spirited and theological legacy instructing future generations for years to come. May his teachings continue to inspire and involve our work every day towards a unified global community. Against all darkness, I am confident the light of Lubomyr Husar will continue to shine and endure. May his soul guide and protect his beloved homeland.                          ____________________
