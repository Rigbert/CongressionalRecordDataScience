 President, I thank the distinguished minority whip, Mr. Lott, for pointing out for the Senate a few moments ago the importance of rule XVI. I also want to thank the junior Senator from South Carolina for understanding, as well, that is a rule that has occasionally been reversed and restored in the Senate, and I think it is important to most of us that it continue to be in effect.  I also thank the majority leader and Senator Vitter for the colloquy we just heard. I think it is entirely possible for us to conduct our business in a civil fashion. I think we have just experienced a good example of the Senate working together on a bipartisan basis to get back together and to begin to move forward and finish this bill as soon as possible. Certainly, I share the views of the majority leader that we need to wrap up this bill in the very near future.  I yield the floor.
