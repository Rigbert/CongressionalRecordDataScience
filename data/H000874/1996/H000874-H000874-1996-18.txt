Speaker, we do have to be real when we deal with financial questions, with investment questions, and what America is going to be like in the future.  President Clinton talked about a bridge to the future. Every one of my constituents believes that the bridge to the future is education. Almost every American believes that one of the reasons we have opportunity in America is because we have educational access for every American.  This year, however, when we passed the Labor-HHS-Education appropriation bill out of the House, we cut education very substantially. Democrats wanted to add education funds at the subcommittee makeup. I offered an amendment to add $2.1 billion so that we would not lose Head Start slots, we would not lose Chapter 1 slots, we would not lose Goals 2000 dollars for investment in education.  Today there was an article in the Post written by David Broder, one of Washington's most respected columnists and political observers. It is entitled, ``Empower Qualified Teachers.'' His point is that we are not spending sufficient sums on education.  I want to quickly add that I do not believe that money is the only answer or particularly the answer to solving the educational problems that confront our Nation. Nor, however, do I delude myself--nor should we delude the public--that not spending money, not paying teachers properly, not having Head Start slots, not having Chapter 1 slots,not doing Goals 2000, not having objectives that will empower our young people to be competitive in a world marketplace, that not doing those things will enhance education in America.  We came to the subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations and I offered the amendment to essentially keep education even. Even then it would fall behind the very sharply growing numbers of students in our school systems. There are more students in school in America today than ever before in history.  And what did we do in the House of Representatives when we passed the education bill? We sounded retreat. Terrel Bell, the Secretary of Education under Ronald Reagan, did a report on the status of education. The result of that was ``A Nation At Risk,'' in which the Reagan administration said that we were at risk of becoming a nation of mediocrity because our education system was not up to speed.  Very frankly, in the Subcommittee on Labor-HHS appropriations, by a straight party-line vote, the Republicans rejected increasing education. When the bill came to the House floor, which is the process, subcommittee, full committee, and House floor, David Obey, the ranking member of our committee, again offered my amendment. He said, ``My friends, on both sides of the aisle, let us not abandon our children,'' because they are our bridge to the future.  On an almost straight party-line vote, that amendment was again rejected, notwithstanding the fact that I had a chart that showed that education funding was going down in an era when student population was going up.  Mr. Speaker, that legislation then went to the Senate. And just yesterday, having, I presume, read the polls and figured out what the American public really wants, and talking not about their policies and principles of 1995 but their policies of 1996, Senate Republicans now suggested adding $2.3 billion to education. That is $200 million more than I suggested was necessary to keep education even, that David Obey suggested was necessary to keep kids from falling through the cracks.  I am pleased that the Senate has seen the light. I hope that the Republicans in the House have done their homework and that this amendment will be accepted when this bill again comes to the floor of the House of Representatives.                          ____________________
