President, when I pick up the newspaper, turn on the radio, or watch television, almost all of the media's attention is, understandably, focused on the war in Iraq. As a result, some important issues in other parts of the world are being overlooked or unreported. I want to call attention to some good news that has received very little attention: Congress has made some much needed progress on the very important issue of conflict diamonds.  The role of diamonds in fueling brutal conflicts in Africa and funding terrorism is well documented, so I will not take much time recounting this history. Suffice it to say, that it is a critical problem and deserves serious attention and resources from Congress, the Bush Administration, and the international community.  It is also well known that the diamond industry, key nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and a number of governments came together to create an international regime aimed at stopping the trade in conflict diamonds, called the Kimberley Process. In January 2002, the process was launched and now the individual countries involved need to pass implementing legislation.  It is important that the Congress pass legislation before the next Kimberley Process Plenary Meeting on April 28, 2003, to ensure that the United States continues to play a leadership role on this issue.  However, the timing of the bill should not be the only factor. The legislation needs to reflect not just the wishes of the administration but also the views of a bipartisan group of Senators, including Senators Durbin, DeWine, Feingold, Gregg, and Bingaman, who have been working on this issue for years. The bill must also incorporate input from a wide range of NGOs, from Oxfam to Catholic Relief Services, that have dealt first-hand with the devastating consequences of conflict diamonds.  S. 760, the Clean Diamonds Trade Act, does just that. I rise today to support this legislation. And assuming that a word in the section concerning the Kimberley Process Implementation Coordinating Committee is changed, I also support the House companion, H.R. 1584, which is virtually identical to S. 760.  I commend Senators Grassley and Baucus for producing a solid, bipartisan bill to implement the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS), an international system designed to ensure that rough diamonds entering the United States are legally mined and traded.  When we began drafting this bill several months ago, the administration's proposed legislation was little more than hortatory. It was filled with permissive authorities that would have required the administration to do virtually nothing. It essentially said: ``Thanks, but we'll take care of the problem by ourselves.''  Through a consultative, bipartisan process, Senators Grassley and Baucus worked with interested Senators, the NGO community, and the diamond industry to shape the administration's proposal into meaningful legislation that contains a number of important provisions.  For example, the bill contains a prohibition of the importation of rough diamonds; requires Government oversight of the U.S. Kimberley Process Authority--the industry body responsible for issuing certificates for U.S. rough diamond exports; and includes reporting requirements that can be used to gauge the effectiveness of the system and monitor attempts to circumvent it. In the administration's original proposal, these provisions either did not exist or were seriously watered-down.  While S. 760 is a good bill and is one that I am pleased to cosponsor, there is room for improvement.  There is nothing in this legislation that deals with polished stones. As a result, if an exporter were to make just one ``cut'' to a diamond it would be exempt from KPCS and the implementing legislation. I also think improvements can be made to the criminal penaltieslanguage, the provision on statistics collection, and a handful of other sections.  But we all know that no bill is perfect and no Senator gets everything he or she wants in a broad, bipartisan bill. I mention these shortcomings, not to criticize the efforts of the authors of the bill, but rather for two important reasons.  First, the shortcomings in the S. 760, as well as the KPCS itself, highlight the fact that Kimberley is an ongoing process and that additional regulations, legislation, and other measures will be necessary in the future. I am very pleased that Senators Grassley and Baucus have included a sense of Congress in S. 760 that says just that.  Second, because the legislation gives the administration a good deal of flexibility, it is imperative that the State Department, Treasury Department, and other agencies follow through and implement the KPCS in an effective and timely manner. I can assure you that those of us who are co-sponsors of this legislation will be working to ensure this happens.  As I have said with countless other pieces of legislation, you can have the best bill in the world, but it is not worth a whole lot if Congress and the administration do not put the resources behind it.  I applaud the authors of the bill for including a Section in the bill that authorizes the President to provide technical assistance to developing nations seeking to implement the KPCS. But, it is up to the Appropriations Committee to make sure this initiative is funded.  As ranking member of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, I included a provision in the fiscal year 2003 bill that appropriated $2 million for this purpose. However, I have been informed that it is unclear if the State Department plans on utilizing these funds for their intended purpose, and that the Department might transfer it to other programs.  This would be a big mistake. In order to effectively implement Kimberley, extremely poor nations, where diamonds are mined, will have to set up viable export-control and law enforcement systems. Many of these nations simply do not have enough resources to do this.  Because of the links between conflict diamonds and terrorism, as well as human rights and humanitarian concerns, it is important that the United States provide technical assistance in order to have the most effective system possible. If providing a small amount of funding helps strengthen the KPCS, we should do it.  Some in the administration might ask how one would go about implementing such a program.  Those who ask those questions need to look no further than two programs that the U.S. Government has implemented in the past.  The United States Agency for International Development supported a successful program in Sierra Leone to improve controls associated with the mining and export of diamonds. In addition, the United States provides technical assistance to nations to implement the World Trade Organization agreement. I am confident that these two programs can provide a model for the use of these funds.  Americans buy 65 to 70 percent of the world's diamonds, including rough diamonds, polished stones and jewelry containing diamonds. It is up to the United States to provide leadership on this very important issue. Without us, the world will not make the kind of progress it needs to on this and other human rights related matters.  This should not be hard for us to do. It is in our security interests. It is in our humanitarian interests. It is in our economic interests.  With the passage of the Clean Diamonds Trade Act, Congress will take an important step forward. There is much more work that needs to be done, but I am confident that it can be done.  In closing, I would like to thank some of those involved with this effort, including Everett Eissenstat and Carrie Clark of Senator Grassley's staff, Shara Aranoff of Senator Baucus' staff, Randy Soderquist of Senator Bingaman's staff, Laura Parker of Senator DeWine's staff, and last but certainly not least Cara Thanassi of Oxfam America. Without the help of these individuals, this bill would not have made it to first base. I thank them for their hard work.                          ____________________
