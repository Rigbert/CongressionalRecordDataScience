 President, on another matter, once the budget is approved, we will continue our work onthe bipartisan Iran bill. Then it is my hope to turn to another bipartisan measure, the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act--TPA.  This bill would enhance Congress's role in the trade process while ensuring Presidents of either party have the necessary tools to secure strong, enforceable trade agreements for American workers. Here is why that is important. Without this bipartisan legislation, American workers and farmers, including from my home State of Kentucky, will not be able to reap the rewards of selling more made-in-America goods to places such as Europe and the Pacific.  This is a bill we should all want to support. So it won't surprise anyone to hear this bill has substantial bipartisan support. It even passed the Committee on Finance on an overwhelming vote of 20 to 6--20 to 6.  But of course we have already heard of an attempt to stand in the way of this bipartisan effort to debate this legislation. We have already heard of yet another effort to make a partisan stand against a bipartisan accomplishment that would help grow opportunities for our constituents.  So yes, some may oppose allowing American workers to compete and win in new markets. Some may not be all that excited about selling more products stamped ``Made in America'' to places such as Europe and the Pacific. But the reality is the American people deserve more opportunities, not more special interest roadblocks.  That is why I plan, with the support of Members of both parties, to turn to the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act once we finish the Iran bill.                          ____________________
