 President, I am very pleased to rise today in support of the Senate's passage of the Intelligence Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2012. I understand that the House of Representatives intends to consider this legislation on the suspension calendar later this week, so it should be enacted prior to the end of this session.  This will be the third time in less than 15 months that the Congress will enact an intelligence authorization bill--including bills for fiscal years 2010, 2011, and 2012--after a 6 year hiatus in passing such legislation. What this means is that Congress, through the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, is restoring oversight over the intelligence community and fulfilling our responsibility to thoroughly examine intelligence policies and budgets.  Unlike the last two authorization bills, this bill was completed contemporaneously with, instead of after, the appropriations process that funds intelligence efforts. The classified annex to this legislation authorizes appropriations for intelligence activities and has helped guide the work of the appropriations committees as they considered intelligence spending. The days when the intelligence community can bypass the intelligence committees and deal solely with the appropriations committees are over.  Since receiving the President's budget request for the intelligence community in February, the Intelligence Committee has recognized that the massive increase in intelligence spending over the past decade has come to an end. Our original bill, reported to the Senate in August of this year, reduced intelligence spending below the President's request. Since then, we have worked closely with the House Intelligence Committee, the Senate Appropriations Committee, and the executive branch to reflect the spending reductions set in the Budget Control Act of 2011. The legislation we are approving today keeps funding for intelligence essentially flat from fiscal year 2011, representing the a meaningful reduction from the President's request.  As we look to 2013, many more difficult decisions will need to be made to make further reductions to intelligence spending. It is my belief that real reductions in intelligence spending can be accomplished without sacrificing capability, but this will require a rigorous review and the executive branch being more forthcoming than it has been to date about where it believes cuts are possible.  Of course, the bill also provides significant legislative provisions to give the intelligence community the authorities and flexibilities it needs to continue protecting our national security and providing policymakers the information they need to make foreign policy and security decisions; and other provisions for the effective and appropriate functioning of our intelligence apparatus.  I note that passage of the last intelligence authorization bill occurred shortly after the strike leading to the death of Usama bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Since then, the intelligence community has had continued success in tracking and removing terrorist threats to the United States. Senior leaders and commanders of al-Qaida, including all of its affiliate groups as well as militant organizations involved in the Afghan war, have been removed from the fight, and terrorist plots and plotting have been disrupted. Among them, a plot to kill the Saudi Ambassador to the United States was thwarted due to the skillful and cooperative efforts of the FBI, DEA, CIA, and others.  Intelligence has factored into significant policy decisions and U.S. actions, including with respect to interdicting the proliferation of weapons, setting economic sanctions, protecting ISAF forces in Afghanistan, blocking cyber attacks against our government and certain critical infrastructure companies, and contributing to the NATO effort in Libya.  It is my hope that the provisions in this bill will continue to aid the intelligence community as it conducts its missions; ensure better stewardship of taxpayer dollars; and support its thousands of civilians and military employees.  Among other things, this bill includes: A section that provides for burial allowances for intelligence employees killed in the line of duty, similar to those for members of the U.S. military; New procurement authorities that enable intelligence agencies to protect against supply chain risk to information technologies; a measure authorizing new accounts at the Department of Treasury that will enable defense intelligence agencies to become financially auditable; Provisions that strengthen congressional oversight of the transfer of detainees from Guantanamo Bay; a section that will improve the accuracy of intelligence community cost estimates; and Provisions that provide the Director of National Intelligence with needed personnel management authorities.  As I noted, the bill contains a 275-page classified schedule and annex that authorizes intelligence funding and implements the committee's oversight findings over the past year. That annex is available to all Senators in the intelligence committee's offices.  Mr. President, let me note my sincere appreciation for the close collaboration of Senator Chambliss, the vice chairman of the committee, throughout the legislative process. He and his staff--in particular Martha Scott Poindexter and Jacqueline Russell--have continued the bipartisan approach that the committee followed in the last Congress, and we have together agreed to every provision in the bill.  As can be imagined, it has taken enormous effort to produce a third bill in such a short time frame. I sincerely thank the efforts of the staff to review the President's requested funding levels and legislative provisions, to draft legislation, and to negotiate a final product. In particular, I thank Lorenzo Goco, the Deputy Staff Director who has overseen the legislative efforts, Michael Davidson, the general counsel of the Senate Intelligence Committee until this past Labor Day, and Christine Healey, who has carried the load of the legislative work throughout and who replaced Mr. Davidson as general counsel. I also extend my appreciation for the work of Eric Losick and Mike Buchwald, majority counsel on the Committee, and Jack Livingston and Kathleen Rice, the minority counsel.  Similarly, the Committee's budget staff has worked diligently and expertly in their preparation of the classified annex to this bill and in working with intelligence agencies to understand and guide their efforts. I thank the committee's budget director, Peggy Evans, and the budget staff through this period: Hayden Milberg, Randy Bookout, Andrew Kerr, John Dickas, Paul Matulic, Matt Pollard, Amy Hopkins, Jamal Ware, Iram Ali, Jeffrey Howard, Andy Grotto, Jim Smythers, Brian Miller, Eric Chapman, John Maguire, Tyler Stephens, Evan Gottesman, Brian Walsh, Ryan Tully, and Christian Cook.  I also appreciate the work and relationship with Chairman Rogers and Ranking Member Ruppersberger of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The version of the legislation approved today builds on the House legislation, and our two committees have consulted closely throughout this process. We held a joint open hearing on the tenth anniversary of the September 11, 2011, attacks and I look forward to continuing to work together next year to enact the fiscal year 2013 intelligence authorization bill.  Let me also note my appreciation for two other Senate committees. The Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense has closely followed our authorizations as it drafted its appropriations bill. This underscores the work done in our bill, and limits to a minimum the cases where the authorization and appropriations levels do not match.  We have also worked over the past week with the Senate Armed Services Committee to include language in the classified annex to this bill concerning the Military Intelligence Program and a military construction program authorized for the National SecurityAgency. The Armed Services Committee and the Intelligence Committee both exercise jurisdiction over military construction projects with intelligence funding; in this instance, the two committees have both included authorizations for the High Performance Computing Center II, and have jointly agreed to the language included in this annex.  Finally, Mr. President, I note that while there is no committee report or conference report associated with the text that we are approving today, the Intelligence Committee issued a report to accompany the bill it reported to the Senate in August. As the legislation has changed since House passage of its authorization bill and consideration today of this amendment, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a section-by-section analysis of the legislation so as to provide for the legislative history needed to explain the authors' intent and better clarify the effects of the provisions included.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       For purposes of the legislative history of the Intelligence      Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, the Managers      Amendment we will pass today is an amendment in the nature of      a substitute to H.R. 1892. In large measure, the legislative      text of H.R. 1892 and this Managers Amendment follows the      legislative text of S. 1458, reported from the Select      Committee on Intelligence on August 1, 2011, Report No. 112-     43. The Managers Amendment also includes a classified      Schedule of Authorizations and annex; this is a modified      version of the classified Schedule and annex that were passed      by the House of Representatives. They have been made      available to the Executive Branch and appropriate      congressional committees. The report language in the annex      should be understood to represent congressional intent where      reference is made to the Committee.              Section-by-Section Analysis and Explanation              Title I--Budget and Personnel Authorizations     Section 101. Authorization of appropriations       Section 101 lists the United States Government departments,      agencies, and other elements for which the Act authorizes      appropriations for intelligence and intelligence-related      activities for Fiscal Year 2012.     Section 102. Classified Schedule of Authorizations       Section 102(a) provides that the details of the amounts      authorized to be appropriated for intelligence and      intelligence-related activities and the applicable personnel      levels for Fiscal Year 2012 are contained in the classified      Schedule of Authorizations and that the classified Schedule      of Authorizations shall be made available to the Committees      on Appropriations of the Senate and House of Representatives      and to the President. Section 102(b) provides that the      President shall not publicly disclose the classified Schedule      except as provided in Section 601(a) of the Implementing      Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007; to the      extent necessary to implement the budget; or as otherwise      required by law. Section 102(c) authorizes the Director of      the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to expend funds      authorized in the Act for a purpose further described in the      classified annex.     Section 103. Personnel Ceiling Adjustments       Section 103 is intended to provide additional flexibility      to the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) in managing      the civilian personnel of the Intelligence Community. Section      103(a) provides that the DNI may authorize employment of      civilian personnel (expressed as full-time equivalent      positions) in Fiscal Year 2012 in excess of the number of      authorized full-time equivalent positions by an amount not      exceeding 3 percent of the total limit applicable to each IC      element under Section 102. The DNI may do so only if      necessary to the performance of important intelligence      functions.       Section 103(b) provides additional flexibility when the      heads of Intelligence Community elements determine that work      currently performed by contract personnel should be performed      by government employees. It does so by authorizing the DNI to      authorize employment of additional full-time equivalent      personnel in a number equal to the number of full-time      equivalent contract personnel currently performing that work.      Under this section, any exercise of this authority should be      implemented in accordance with a plan that includes adequate      support for personnel. It is intended that the exercise of      this authority should result in an actual reduction of the      number of contract personnel and not a shift of resources to      hire other contract personnel.       The DNI must report the decision to allow an Intelligence      Community element to exceed the personnel ceiling or to      convert contract personnel under Section 103(a) and (b) in      advance to the congressional intelligence committees.       During consideration of the Fiscal Year 2008 request, the      congressional intelligence committees learned that practices      within different elements of the Intelligence Community on      the counting of personnel with respect to legislatively-fixed      ceilings were inconsistent, and included not counting certain      personnel at all against personnel ceilings. The committees      requested that the Intelligence Community Chief Human Capital      Officer ensure that by the beginning of Fiscal Year 2010      there would be a uniform and accurate method of counting all      Intelligence Community employees under a system of personnel      levels expressed as full-time equivalents. The committees      also expressed their view that the DNI express the personnel      levels for civilian employees of the Intelligence Community      as full-time equivalent positions in the congressional budget      justifications for Fiscal Year 2010. The DNI has done so. In      addition, the DNI has issued a policy to ensure a uniform      method for counting Intelligence Community employees.      Subsection (c) confirms in statute the obligation of the DNI      to establish these guidelines.     Section 104. Intelligence Community Management Account       Section 104 authorizes appropriations for the Intelligence      Community Management Account (ICMA) of the DNI and sets the      authorized full-time equivalent personnel levels for the      elements within the ICMA for Fiscal Year 2012.       Subsection (a) authorizes appropriations of $576,393,000      for Fiscal Year 2012 for the activities of the ICMA.      Subsection (b) authorizes 777 full-time or full-time      equivalent personnel for elements within the ICMA for Fiscal      Year 2012 and provides that such personnel may be permanent      employees of the Office of the Director of National      Intelligence (ODNI) or detailed from other elements of the      United States Government.       Subsection (c) authorizes additional appropriations and      full-time equivalent personnel for the classified Community      Management Account as specified in the classified Schedule of      Authorizations and permits the funding for advanced research      and development to remain available through September 30,      2013. Title II--Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System     Section 201. Authorization of appropriations       Section 201 authorizes appropriations in the amount of      $514,000,000 for Fiscal Year 2012 for the Central      Intelligence Agency (CIA) Retirement and Disability Fund. For      Fiscal Year 2011, Congress authorized $292,000,000. While      that level was consistent with prior authorizations, it did      not fully fund, as prior authorizations had not fully funded,      the obligations of the Fund. The Fiscal Year 2012 increase is      based on the Administration's determination, which the      congressional intelligence committees support, that the      obligations of this retirement and disability system should      be fully funded.           Title III--General Intelligence Community Matters     Section 301. Increase in employee compensation and benefits          authorized by law       Section 301 provides that funds authorized to be      appropriated by this Act for salary, pay, retirement, and      other benefits for federal employees may be increased by such      additional or supplemental amounts as may be necessary for      increases in compensation or benefits authorized by law.     Section 302. Restriction on conduct of intelligence          activities       Section 302 provides that the authorization of      appropriations by the Act shall not be deemed to constitute      authority for the conduct of any intelligence activity that      is not otherwise authorized by the Constitution or laws of      the United States.     Section 303. Annual report on hiring of National Security          Education Program participants       Section 303 requires a report not later than 90 days after      the end of the fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014, by the head      of each element of the Intelligence Community on the number      of personnel hired by such element during such fiscal year      who were at any time recipients of a grant or scholarship      under the David L. Boren National Security Education Act of      1991 (50 USC 1901 et seq.). The report may be in classified      form.     Section 304. Enhancement of authority for flexible personnel          management among the elements of the intelligence          community       Section 304 adds a subsection to Section 102A of the      National Security Act of 1947 to promote the ability to      manage all the elements of the Intelligence Community as a      single cohesive community. The new Subsection 102A(v) enables      the DNI, with the concurrence of the head of the covered      department concerned and in coordination with the Director of      the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), to convert      competitive service positions within an Intelligence      Community element of the covered department to excepted      positions and to establish new positions in the excepted      service within an Intelligence Community element of a covered      department. Under Section 304, an incumbent occupying a      position on the date of enactment selected to be converted to      the excepted service shall have the right to refuse the      conversion. Once such individual no longer occupies the      position, the position may be converted.       Because of their unique intelligence, investigative and      national security missions, most Intelligence Community      elements are in the excepted civil service. However, civilian      employees in several smaller Intelligence Community elements      are still covered under competitive service rules. The      ability to convert those positions to the excepted service     will enable the Intelligence Community to maintain a system      throughout the Intelligence Community that is responsive to      the needs of the Intelligence Community both for secrecy and      the ability to quickly respond to personnel requirements. The      DNI has requested a similar authority in the past. Under      Section 304, the covered departments are the Department of      Energy, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department      of State, and the Department of the Treasury.       Although new positions in the excepted service may be      created within an element of the Intelligence Community      within the covered departments under this authority, the      personnel ceilings referred to in Section 102(a) still apply      to the number of personnel in an element. It is not intended      for this conversion authority to be used to increase the      number of full-time equivalent personnel in an intelligence      element above the applicable personnel ceilings.     Section 305. Preparation of nuclear proliferation assessment          statements       As set forth in the Atomic Energy Act, the United States      may enter into a Civilian Nuclear Agreement (or ``123      Agreement'') with another nation or multinational      organization. After negotiating the terms of the 123      Agreement, the Administration submits the terms to Congress      for review along with a Nuclear Proliferation Assessment      Statement (NPAS). Under current law, the NPAS is drafted by      the State Department, in consultation with the Director of      Central Intelligence; the Act has not been amended to reflect      the establishment of the Director of National Intelligence.      In multiple reports, the Government Accountability Office has      identified various problems with this process, including      insufficient time for consultation with the Intelligence      Community, a lack of adequate formal interagency guidance for      NPAS development, and ambiguity as to whether Intelligence      Community comments were fully incorporated into the final      NPAS. Section 305 is a modification of Section 305 of S. 1458      as reported from the Senate Intelligence Committee and is      intended to clarify the role of the DNI and the Intelligence      Community in the NPAS process.       Section 305 amends the National Security Act of 1947 to      require the DNI, in consultation with the heads of the      appropriate elements of the Intelligence Community and the      Secretary of State, to provide an addendum to each NPAS      accompanying a civilian nuclear cooperation agreement,      containing a comprehensive analysis of the country's export      control system with respect to nuclear-related matters. The      DNI is to provide the addendum to the President, the      congressional intelligence committees and the congressional      foreign relations committees.     Section 306. Cost estimates       Section 306 amends Section 506A of the National Security      Act of 1947 to require that independent cost estimates      include all costs associated with a major system acquisition      even when a service or capability to deliver end-to-end      functionality will be provided by another Intelligence      Community agency or element. This additional requirement in      the preparation of the independent cost estimate will assist      Congress and the Executive Branch in evaluating the full cost      of an acquisition, including the costs to process, exploit,      disseminate, and store the information such major systems      collect. The amendments made by Section 306 become effective      180 days after enactment.     Section 307. Updates of intelligence relating to terrorism          recidivism of detainees held at United States Naval          Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba       Section 307 provides for a regular unclassified summary of      intelligence relating to recidivism of detainees formerly      held at Guantanamo Bay to be made public by the DNI. Section      334 of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year      2010, Public Law 111-259, required the DNI, along with the      Director of the CIA and the Director of the Defense      Intelligence Agency, to make publicly available, on a one-     time basis, an unclassified summary that includes the      intelligence relating to former Guantanamo detainees. Under      Section 319 of the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2009,      Public Law 111-32, the President is required to submit      classified quarterly reports to Congress that include      classified information about detainees' recidivist      activities.       Section 307 amends the National Security Act of 1947 to      require the semiannual updating of the Section 334 report,      which is to include an unclassified summary of intelligence      relating to recidivism of detainees currently or formerly      held at Guantanamo Bay and an assessment of the likelihood      that such detainees will engage in terrorism or communicate      with persons in terrorist organizations. The initial update      shall be made publicly available not later than 10 days after      the date that the first report following enactment is      submitted to members and committees pursuant to Section 319      of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009. The summary      will be prepared by the DNI, in consultation with the      Director of the CIA and the Director of the Defense      Intelligence Agency, and will include the number of confirmed      or suspected recidivists.     Section 308. Notification of transfer of a detainee held at          United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba       Section 308 requires the President to submit to Congress,      in classified form, at least 30 days prior to the transfer or      release of an individual detained at Naval Station,      Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as of June 24, 2009, the following      information: (1) the name of the individual to be transferred      or released; (2) the country or freely associated state to      which the individual is to be transferred; (3) the terms of      any agreement with the country or state for the acceptance of      such individual, including the amount of any financial      assistance related to such agreement; and (4) the agencies or      departments of the United States responsible for ensuring the      agreement is carried out.       Section 308 is a modification of Section 306 of S. 1458,      which amended similar notification requirements found in      Public Law 111-83, 123 Stat. 2178, and Public Law 111-88, 123      Stat. 2963. Section 308 requires the notification be at least      30 days, rather than 15 days, prior to transfer and requires      information be provided concerning what agencies or      departments of the United States, if any, are responsible for      ensuring any agreement with the receiving country or state is      carried out. Nothing in this section is to be construed to      supersede or otherwise affect Section 1028 of the National      Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 or Section      8120 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2012.     Section 309. Enhanced procurement authority to manage supply          chain risk       Section 309 authorizes the heads of those elements of the      Intelligence Community outside the Department of Defense to      take certain procurement actions under certain circumstances      to reduce the risk that an adversary may sabotage,      maliciously introduce unwanted functions, or otherwise      subvert information systems so as to surveil, deny, disrupt      or otherwise degrade them. Section 309 is based on Section      806 of the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act      for Fiscal Year 2011 (Public Law 111-383).       Section 309(a) defines the following terms: covered agency,      covered item of supply, covered procurement, covered      procurement action, covered system, and supply chain risk.      The definitions of these terms are modifications of the      definitions of these terms as found in Section 309 of S.      1458, to include specific references to appropriate      provisions of existing law.       Under subsection (b), the head of a covered agency, in      consultation with the DNI, is authorized to carry out a      covered procurement action and limit the disclosure of      information concerning the basis for such action. Covered      procurement actions are subject to the conditions in      subsection (c), including appropriate consultation with      procurement officials within the covered agency and a      determination made in writing that the use of the authority      is necessary to protect national security. In addition, there      must be a determination that less intrusive measures are not      reasonably available. Where the head of the covered agency      plans to limit disclosure of information relating to the      basis for carrying out a covered procurement action, the risk      to national security due to disclosing such information must      outweigh the risk of not disclosing such information.       The head of the covered agency must give notice to the      congressional intelligence committees of a determination to      exercise this authority. Subsection (d) limits delegation of      the authority to take a covered procurement action to no      lower than the level of the service acquisition executive for      the agency concerned. Subsection (e) provides that the      authority under the section is in addition to any other      authority under any other provision of law. The authority      provided in Section 309 is not intended to alter or effect      the exercise of any other provision of law, including other      procurement authorities available to an intelligence agency      head to protect the national security.       The requirements of Section 309 take effect 180 days after      enactment and expire on the date that Section 806 of the Ike      Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year      2011 expires, which will occur in January 2014.     Section 310. Burial allowances       Section 310 authorizes the head of a department or agency      that contains an element of the Intelligence Community to pay      a burial allowance to the estate of a civilian officer or      employee of such department or agency who dies as the result      of hostile or terrorist activities or intelligence activities      having a substantial element of risk. The burial allowance is      to reimburse the estate for burial expenses, including      recovery, mortuary, funeral, or memorial service, cremation,      burial costs, and costs of transportation. The amount of the      burial allowance is not to be greater than the maximum      reimbursable amount available to the uniformed services under      Department of Defense Instruction 1344.08 or its successor,      now set at $8,800, plus actual transportation costs, and is      in addition to any other benefit permitted under any other      provision of law, including funds that may be expended as      specified in the General Provisions of the classified annex      accompanying this Act.       In addition, Section 310 requires the Director of the OPM,      in consultation with the DNI and the Secretaries of Labor and      Defense, to submit a report to Congress no later than 180      days after enactment on the feasibility of implementing      legislation to provide for burial allowances at a level that      adequately addresses the cost of burial expenses and provides      for equitable treatment when any officer or employee of the      federal government dies as the result of an injury sustained      in the performance of official duties.     Section 311. Modification of certain reporting requirements       The Congress frequently requests information from the      Intelligence Community in the     form of reports, the contents of which are specifically      defined by statute. The reports prepared pursuant to these      statutory requirements provide Congress with an invaluable      source of information about specific matters of concern.       Congressional reporting requirements, and particularly      recurring reporting requirements, however, can place a      significant burden on the resources of the Intelligence      Community. The congressional intelligence committees are      therefore reconsidering these reporting requirements on a      periodic basis to ensure that the reports that have been      requested are the best mechanism for the Congress to receive      the information it seeks. In some cases, annual reports can      be replaced with briefings or notifications that provide the      Congress with more timely information and offer the      Intelligence Community a direct line of communication to      respond to congressional concerns.       In response to a request from the DNI, the congressional      intelligence committees examined a set of recurring reporting      requirements nominated by the Intelligence Community. Because      the majority of recurring reports provide critical      information relevant to challenges facing the Intelligence      Community today, Section 311 eliminates or modifies only four      statutory reporting requirements, all from past intelligence      authorization acts or the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism      Prevention Act of 2004.     Section 312. Review of strategic and competitive analysis          conducted by the intelligence community       Section 312 requires the DNI to direct the Director's      Senior Advisory Group to conduct a comprehensive review of      the strategic and competitive analysis of international      terrorism and homegrown violent extremism conducted by      elements of the Intelligence Community during the 12 month      period following enactment. Within 15 months of enactment,      the Director shall submit to the congressional intelligence      committees a report on the results of the review and any      actions taken by the Director to implement the      recommendations, if any, of the Senior Advisory Group based      on such results.  TITLE IV--MATTERS RELATING TO ELEMENTS OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY      Subtitle A--Office of the Director of National Intelligence     Section 401. Intelligence community assistance to counter          drug trafficking organizations using public lands       Section 401 requires the DNI to consult with the heads of      the federal land management agencies on the appropriate      actions the Intelligence Community can take to assist such      agencies in responding to the threat from international drug      trafficking organizations or other drug traffickers that are      currently or have previously used public lands in the United      States to further their operations. The DNI is to submit a      report to the congressional intelligence and judiciary      committees within 180 days of enactment on the results of      this consultation.     Section 402. Application of certain financial reporting          requirements to the Office of the Director of National          Intelligence       Section 402 provides a limited grace period for the ODNI in      meeting the requirements of 31 USC 3515 until Fiscal Year      2013. The DNI, in requesting this legislative provision,      stated that the grace period will allow time for the      implementation of system improvements as well as process      changes in the financial management system currently      supporting the ODNI. Together these efforts are intended to      yield financial statements that meet the prescribed legal and      audit standards.       Although the ODNI, under 31 USC 3515, is required to      prepare and submit to the Congress and the Director of the      Office of Management and Budget an audited financial      statement for the preceding fiscal year by March 1st, Section      369 of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year      2010, enacted on October 7, 2010, directs the DNI ``to      develop a plan and schedule to achieve a full, unqualified      audit of each element of the intelligence community not later      than September 30, 2013.'' Section 402 will align the      statutory requirement for auditability with the plan for      achieving auditability set forth in the Fiscal Year 2010 Act.     Section 403. Public availability of information regarding the          Inspector General of the Intelligence Community       Section 403 requires the DNI to establish and maintain on      the publicly accessible ODNI website information relating to      the Inspector General for the Intelligence Community      including methods to contact the Inspector General. Section      403 is based on a similar requirement in Section 8L of the      Inspector General Act, as added by the Inspector General      Reform Act of 2008, 5 USC App., and is similar to Section      413, applicable to the CIA Inspector General. The      information about the Inspector General is to be obvious      and facilitate access to the Inspector General. Given that      most of the Inspector General's reports will be      classified, Section 403 does not require that Inspector      General reports and audits be posted on the publicly      accessible website.     Section 404. Clarification of Status of Chief Information          Officer in the Executive Schedule       Section 404 amends 5 USC 5315 to establish the salary level      of the Chief Information Officer of the Intelligence      Community at Level IV of the Executive Schedule, the level of      other chief information officers in the federal government      with comparable duties and responsibilities. The Chief      Information Officer of the Intelligence Community is a      position established in Section 103G of the National Security      Act, added by Section 303 of Public Law 108-487, the      Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005, and      amended by Section 404 of Public Law 111-259, the      Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010.     Section 405. Temporary appointment to fill vacancies within          Office of the Director of National Intelligence       Section 405 permits the President to make temporary      appointments to fill vacancies in offices within the ODNI      that require Senate confirmation (except the DNI, for whom by      Section 103A(a)(6) of the National Security Act of 1947 the      Principal Deputy DNI is next in line) with an individual who      serves in another element of the Intelligence Community. A      similar provision was requested by the DNI.       The Vacancies Act (5 USC 3345(a)(1)) provides that upon a      vacancy in a Senate-confirmed position (1) the first      assistant of the office may begin serving as the acting      officer immediately and automatically upon the occurrence of      the vacancy; (2) another officer who has already received      Senate confirmation may be directed by the President to serve      as the acting officer; and (3) certain other senior agency      officials may be designated by the President to serve in an      acting capacity. Given the relatively small size of the ODNI,      the fact that a significant number of the personnel within      the ODNI are on detail to the office from other elements of      the Intelligence Community, and the fact that positions in      the ODNI to which the Vacancy Act applies serve the entire      Intelligence Community (such as the Director of the National      Counterterrorism Center or the Inspector General for the      Intelligence Community), an individual employed within the      Intelligence Community but outside the ODNI may be best      suited to fill a key leadership position temporarily.       Section 405 addresses this issue by expanding the      President's choice for appointment under the third category      of the Vacancies Act to include senior officials from any      element of the Intelligence Community. Nothing in Section 401      modifies or precludes the utilization of sections 3345(a)(1)      or (2) of title 5 to fill vacancies.                Subtitle B--Central Intelligence Agency     Section 411. Acceptance of gifts       Section 411 is a provision that arose out of the CIA's      review of benefits available to the survivors of CIA      employees killed in the line of duty following the December      2009 attack at Khowst, Afghanistan. The CIA concluded that      the Director of the CIA did not have the authority under      Section 12 of the CIA Act to accept and use gifts for      purposes related to the welfare, education and recreation of      those survivors. Under current law, the Director of the CIA      may ``accept, hold, administer, and use gifts of money,      securities and other property whenever the Director      determines it would be in the interest of the United States .      . . for purposes relating to the general welfare, education,      or recreation of employees or dependents of employees of the      Agency or for similar purposes. . . .''       Section 411 amends Section 12 of the CIA Act to authorize      the Director (or the Director's designee) both to accept      gifts and to use them for the welfare of employees injured in      the line of duty without legal concern whether those actions      are for the general welfare of the CIA employee population as      a whole. It also provides that gifts may be used for the      assistance of the family of CIA officers who were injured or      who died from hostile or terrorist activities or in      connection with other intelligence activities having a      substantial element of risk. Gifts for injured employees and      their families or survivors are to be accepted by the CIA on      behalf of the CIA employees concerned, and not directly by      such employees or their family members. The Director is      authorized to assign the gifts accepted under the new      authority provided by this section to the CIA officers and      their surviving family members.       Section 411 provides that any exercise of authority under      Section 12, including the acceptance of gifts to provide for      the general welfare, education, or recreation of the CIA      employee population as a whole, shall be made according to      regulations developed by the Director of the CIA in      consultation with the Director of the Office of Government      Ethics, consistent with all relevant ethical constraints and      principles.     Section 412. Foreign language proficiency requirements for          Central Intelligence Agency officers       Section 412 makes amendments in Section 104A(g) of the      National Security Act of 1947 which imposes foreign language      requirements on certain personnel within the CIA. Section 412      is intended to tie the need for foreign language skills to      officers in occupations where foreign language ability is      most important, rather than to specific positions, within the      Directorate of Intelligence career service or the National      Clandestine Service career service. It is intended to      eliminate the need for the Director of the CIA to approve      waivers for the promotion, appointment, or transfer of      personnel such as attorneys or human resources officers for      whom the requirement is not intended to apply. Section 412      sets the language proficiency at the objective level of level      3 on the Interagency Language Roundtable Language     Skills Level or a commensurate proficiency level.       Section 412 requires the Director of the CIA to provide a      report within 45 days of enactment, and three subsequent      annual reports, to the congressional intelligence committees      on the number of personnel transferred to a Senior      Intelligence Service position in the Directorate of      Intelligence career service or the National Clandestine      career service who did not meet the foreign language      requirements of Section 104A(g). Section 412 also makes      technical corrections to delete outdated references to the      Directorate of Operations.     Section 413. Public availability of information regarding the          Inspector General of the Central Intelligence Agency       Section 413 requires the Director of the CIA to establish      and maintain on the publicly accessible CIA website      information relating to the CIA Inspector General including      methods to contact the Inspector General. Section 413 is      based on a similar requirement in the Inspector General      Reform Act, 5 USC App. 8L, and is similar to Section 403. The      information about the Inspector General is to be obvious and      facilitate access to the Inspector General. Given that most      of the Inspector General's reports will be classified,      Section 413 does not require that Inspector General reports      and audits be posted on the publicly accessible website.      Section 413 is based upon a request of the CIA Inspector      General.     Section 414. Creating an official record of the Osama bin          Laden operation       Section 414 makes findings concerning the raid of May 1,      2011, that killed terrorist leader Osama bin Laden in his      compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Section 414 includes a      statement of the sense of Congress that the events that      transpired before, during, and as a result of the raid be      memorialized to allow the United States to have an accurate      account of these events in the future. Section 414 requires      the Director of the CIA to provide to the congressional      intelligence committees the report being prepared by the      Center for the Study of Intelligence that documents the      history of and lessons learned from the raid not later than      90 days after its completion and to preserve any records,      including intelligence information and assessments, used to      generate this report.     Section 415. Recruitment of personnel in the Office of the          Inspector General       Section 415 requires the Inspector General of the OPM, in      consultation with the Inspector General of the CIA, to      conduct a study of the personnel authorities and available      personnel benefits of the Office of the Inspector General of      the CIA. The study shall include identification of any      barriers and disincentives to the recruitment or retention      of experienced investigators within the Office of the      Inspector General of the CIA. The study shall compare the      personnel authorities of the CIA Inspector General with      the personnel authorities of other federal Inspectors      General, including a comparison of the benefits available      to experienced investigators within the offices of other      federal Inspectors General with those available to      investigators within the Office of the CIA Inspector      General. The OPM Inspector General is to submit the report      to the congressional intelligence and homeland security      committees not later than 120 days after enactment.                  Subtitle C--National Security Agency     Section 421. Additional authorities for National Security          Agency security personnel       Section 421 amends Section 11 of the National Security      Agency Act of 1959 to authorize NSA security personnel to      transport apprehended individuals from NSA premises to the      custody of law enforcement officials. Under current law, when      NSA security personnel apprehend an individual, they must      wait with the individual until local law enforcement      personnel arrive to complete the transfer of custody. This      can require NSA personnel to wait, frequently for hours,      often with the apprehended individual in a security vehicle,      for the transfer to local law enforcement. According to the      DNI, from 2004 to 2009, on 448 occasions, the apprehension of      an individual engaged NSA personnel and transportation      resources for over 2 hours.       Section 421 provides a limited expansion of authority for      NSA security personnel to transport apprehended individuals      to the custody of local law enforcement within 30 miles of      NSA premises. This authority is to be used sparingly by NSA      security personnel under a well-established regime of      administrative controls and management oversight, and only      with prior consent from the accepting jurisdiction.                       Subtitle D--Other Elements     Section 431. Codification of Office of Intelligence and          Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security as an          element of the intelligence community       Section 431 amends Section 3(4)(K) of the National Security      Act of 1947 in order to include the Office of Intelligence      and Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security within      the term ``intelligence community'' for purposes of the Act.      This provides for a more specific reference to the Office of      Intelligence and Analysis, in addition to the intelligence      element of the Coast Guard, that is part of the Intelligence      Community, in the same manner as Congress has done in Section      3(4)(I) and (J) for the State and Treasury Department      elements of the Intelligence Community.     Section 432. Federal Bureau of Investigation participation in          the Department of Justice leave bank       Section 432 provides for participation of employees of the      FBI in the Department of Justice's Voluntary Leave Bank      Program. The Voluntary Leave Bank Program allows federal      employees to donate to and to receive donations from a leave      ``bank'' to cover absences necessitated by extraordinary      medical conditions. Current law does not allow participation      by FBI employees in the Department's program, although the      FBI is part of the Department. While 5 USC 6372(c) would      allow FBI to establish its own voluntary leave bank program,      the Director of the FBI has determined that it would be more      cost effective and efficient to allow FBI employees to      participate in the larger Department of Justice program and      has requested a legislative provision to accomplish this      objective for the overall benefit of the Bureau and its      personnel.       Under Section 432, the Director is to consider the      protection of sources and methods in allowing for      participation in the leave bank program. In providing for      leave bank opportunities to cover absences necessitated by      extraordinary medical conditions, it is intended that the      Director consider any impact on operations of the Bureau when      making a decision on whether to allow FBI employees to take      part in the program.     Section 433. Accounts and transfer authority for          appropriations and other amounts for intelligence          elements of the Department of Defense       Section 433 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to transfer      defense appropriations available for the activities of the      defense intelligence elements into an account or accounts      established for receipt of such funds. These accounts may      receive transfers and reimbursement from transactions,      authorized by law, between the defense intelligence elements      and other entities, and the DNI may also transfer funds into      these accounts. Appropriations transferred pursuant to this      section shall remain available for the same time period, and      for the same purposes, as the appropriations from which funds      were transferred. This section is intended to ensure improved      auditing of defense intelligence appropriations.     Section 434. Report on training standards of defense          intelligence workforce       Section 434 requires not later than 180 days after      enactment the DNI and the Under Secretary of Defense for      Intelligence to submit to the congressional intelligence and      armed services committees a report on the training standards      of the defense intelligence workforce. The report is to      include a description of existing training, education, and      professional development standards applied to the personnel      of defense intelligence components, and an assessment of the      ability to implement a certification program based on      achievement of required training, education, and professional      development standards.                         TITLE V--OTHER MATTERS     Section 501. Report on airspace restrictions for use of          unmanned aerial vehicles along the border of the United          States and Mexico       Section 501 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security not      later than 90 days after enactment to submit to the      congressional intelligence and homeland security committees a      report on whether restrictions on the use of airspace are      hampering the use of unmanned aerial vehicles by the      Department of Homeland Security along the international      border between the United States and Mexico.     Section 502. Sense of Congress regarding integration of          fusion centers       Section 502 states that it is the sense of Congress that      the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the      DNI, should continue to integrate and utilize fusion centers      to enlist all of the intelligence, law enforcement, and      homeland security capabilities of the United States in a      manner that is consistent with the Constitution to prevent      acts of terrorism against the United States.     Section 503. Strategy to counter improvised explosive devices       Section 503 requires the DNI and the Secretary of Defense      to establish a coordinated strategy utilizing all available      personnel and assets for intelligence collection and analysis      to identify and counter network activity and operations in      Pakistan and Afghanistan relating to the development and use      of improvised explosive devices. Not later than 120 days      after enactment, the DNI and the Secretary of Defense are to      submit a report containing the strategy to the congressional      intelligence and armed services committees and implement such      strategy.     Section 504. Sense of Congress regarding the priority of          railway transportation security       Section 504 states that it is the sense of Congress that      railway transportation security, including subway transit      security, should continue to be prioritized in the critical      infrastructure threat assessment developed by the Office of      Intelligence and Analysis of the Department of Homeland      Security and included in threat assessment budgets of the      Intelligence Community.     Section 505. Technical amendments to the National Security          Act of 1947       Section 505 updates certain references in sections 3(6),      506(b) and 506A of the National Security Act of 1947 from the      ``Director of Central Intelligence'' and the ``National      Foreign Intelligence Program'' to the ``Director     of National Intelligence'' and the ``National Intelligence      Program.''     Section 506. Technical amendments to Title 18, United States          Code       Section 506 updates references in 18 USC 351(a) to the      Director and Deputy Director of Central Intelligence and      provides that the amended section includes the DNI, the      Principal Deputy DNI, and the Director and Deputy Director of      the CIA among officials covered by the provision.     Section 507. Budgetary effects       Section 507 states that the budget effects of this Act, for      the purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act      of 2010, shall be determined by reference to the latest      statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation''      for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional      Record by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee,      provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the      vote on passage.
