Mr. Speaker, I am introducing a resolution today that recognizes that suicide is a national problem and encourages suicide prevention efforts. I am pleased that more than 20 of my colleagues are joining me in this effort by becoming original cosponsors of this bill.  It is my hope that congressional recognition will encourage people to talk about feelings of despair and suicide. An estimated 750,000 people attempt suicide each year. These attempts are traumatic not only for the individual but also for family and friends who surround him or her.  Suicide claims more than 31,000 lives annually, more than homicide. It is the ninth leading cause of all deaths in the United States and the third for young people aged 15 to 24. It is on the rise for young people in general and for African-American young men in particular.  We must talk about mental illness, and we must encourage treatment. We must tell our friends and our loved ones that it is OK to talk about feelings of despair, hopelessness, and suicide. For those who have the courage to get help, to seek treatment--we must support them. And we must talk about suicide so that we can try to understand it and prevent it.  Too much shame surrounds feelings of depression and suicide. We can change that--and we must--by reaching out to others in our community. This resolution recognizes suicide as a national problem and declares suicide prevention to be a national priority. It also encourages initiatives to prevent suicide and support people who have lost someone to suicide.  The Senate has already passed a similar resolution. It is my hope that the House of Representatives will soon consider this important issue.                          ____________________
