 President, if the Senator will yield, she is correct, but it only requires the Secretary to do it if he or she concludes that there is a safer way to reroute the shipment. If the conclusion made by the Secretary is that in a high-risk corridor the rerouting would not result in an increased safety margin for the shipment, then he or she need not reroute it. But it is correct, the presumption is, in a high-risk corridor we reroute if it is not a point of destination or origin but only if the determination by the Secretary is that the shipment, in fact, would be safer to be rerouted. It is on page 4 of the amendment. It is section 2, subparagraph E, ``Transportation and Storage of High Hazard Materials through High Threat Corridor'' areas. It says:       In General.--The standards for the Secretary to grant      exceptions under section     (d)(4) shall require a finding by the Secretary that--       (A) the shipment originates or the point of destination is      in the high threat corridor;       (B) there is no practical alternative route;       (C) there is an unanticipated, temporary emergency that      threatens the lives of persons or property in the high threat      corridor;       (D) there would be no harm to persons or property beyond      the owners or operator of the railroad in the event of a      successful terrorist attack on shipment; or       (E) rerouting would increase the likelihood of a terrorist      attack on the shipment.  The bottom line is that it should be left to the discretion of the Secretary to decide not to reroute rather than the privately owned railroad. I thank the Senator for her clarification.  I yield the floor.
