 President, I want to thank Senator Reid for requesting a leave of absence for me for the duration of this week. I am traveling home today to attend and speak at tomorrow's memorial service for Mr. Bernie Whitebear, of Seattle, Washington, who passed away at the age of 62 on Sunday, July 16, 2000.  Earlier in the week, I did have a statement for the Congressional Record about Bernie Whitebear and his many contributions to Washington state. He was a special man to my constituents. He was a special man to me. Bernie helped me understand Native American cultures from the inside as a participant not as someone sitting on the sidelines. On many occasions, Bernie exposed me to the sense of community and respect that he was always so proud of. Washington state will miss this great man and clearly, it is appropriate for me to be with my constituents tomorrow to celebrate Bernie Whitebear.  I thank my colleagues for their consideration and courtesies and I will have a longer statement next week to discuss Senate floor votes.                          ____________________
