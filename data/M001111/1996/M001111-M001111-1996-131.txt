 President, I rise today to express my opposition to the Republican budget resolution for fiscal year 1997. Quite simply, this budget resolution does not reflect the priorities and values held by most Americans--the belief that we need to ensure our quality of life, educate our children, and care for our elderly and disabled.  I regret that this vote will not be bipartisan, because I believe we have made great progress over the past year. Unfortunately, this Republican budget falls short. It fails to meet us halfway, and it proposes deep cuts in Medicare, education, Medicaid, and the environment while increasing defense spending.
