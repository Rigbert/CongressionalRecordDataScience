President, very briefly, this amendment, which affects the Northern Forests of the States of Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine especially, makes sure the rights and responsibilities of the landowners are emphasized. The primacy of our States, that means very much to each of us, is reinforced, the traditions of the region are protected, but we have the advantage of using new ways of achieving our goals in forestry and the use of our land and ways to do it that did not even exist a few years ago. It is a case where we have had citizens, landowners, foresters, and everybody else come together with a plan that actually works.  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman and ranking member and others who worked with us this afternoon to get this through. I yield the floor.
