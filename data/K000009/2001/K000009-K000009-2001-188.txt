Speaker, I wish to extend my sincere appreciation to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan) for allowing me to precede him here this evening. He is always very gracious and accommodating to other Members.  Mr. Speaker, this evening I begin what will be a series of 5-minute speeches to place in the Record information about a very important trip on our continent that was taken by religious leaders of Canada to Mexico in a fact-finding trip subsequent to the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA.  They traveled there in late March and early April, and in fact have produced probably one of the finest documents I have had the opportunity to read regarding what has happened in the last 7 years post-NAFTA. The delegation included representatives of the Presbyterian Church, the Roman Catholic Church, the Anglican Church, the United Church of Canada, the Canadian Religious Conference, and the Inter-Church Committee on Human Rights in Latin America. They traveled throughout Mexico to all different regions, and this evening I will only talk about a few of the areas that they visited.  The compelling report that they have produced tells all of us who are going to be faced very shortly with a vote on fast-track extension, to move NAFTA to expand its concepts to all of Latin America, to think twice about what we are doing and to go back and redress some of the horrendous conditions that the original NAFTA agreement has created in our own country and in the other two major nations on this continent, Canada and Mexico.  The group first visited the Sierra Tarahumara, which is in the central part of the country in the region of Chihuahua, and I will only read parts of their written report. They begin saying, ``In the once densely forested mountains of the Tarahumara Sierra, we met with the indigenous communities of San Alonso, who gave us a letter for our government, signed with their thumbprints that pleads for 'an end to the impoverishment of our people.' ''  They said, ``People here once lived from agriculture and from selling small amounts of timber, but changes to forestry controls under free trade have brought multinational corporations and clear-cutting. Soils for food crops are eroding,'' and it is important to say the soil layer in Mexico is very thin. For them, it is survival.  They said, ``Laws have been imposed that favor companies from other countries. The local Catholic Church referred to legislation that had preceded NAFTA's passage, and said these laws have enabled much wealth to be taken from the Sierra, leaving behind growing poverty.''  They said, ``We saw the impact of this in the ulcerated sightless corneas of a child, whose mother had nothing to feed him now, but a soup of ground corn. We sat with an indigenous woman who had brought her dying baby to a dispensary run by nuns, and heard that 48 percent of infants in the Sierra die before the age of 5 because of chronic malnutrition. Other than suicide, a new phenomenon in these indigenous communities, the nuns told us, many see only two alternatives: To cultivate marijuana or poppies for drug traffickers or to migrate north in search of work, abandoning ancestral land, breaking up families and splintering communities.''  They said, ``In the community of Baborigame, we heard how 48 percent of children die before the age of 5 from poverty-induced chronic malnutrition. We personally witnessed the desperation of mothers of children who had died. The Carmelite Sisters told us that the situation is worsening. Indigenous people who once were able to eat corn and beans now often can only afford to eat a soup of ground corn, and lately they also have witnessed a new cause of death previously unheard of in these historic indigenous communities, suicides due to sheer hopelessness.''  The report goes on to talk about policies associated with NAFTA have effectively privatized what were once community lands, or ejido lands, that provided rural and indigenous communities with guaranteed land in perpetuity. Unable to get a just price for their products and saddled with overwhelming and unpayable debts, Mexican farmers are increasingly being forced to sell those lands, leading to a growing concentration of land in few hands.  They say those buying up the land and who are renting from farmers unable to make a go of it, including multinationals like PepsiCo, have basically used the land now to produce potatoes for the fast food market in our three countries.  Mr. Speaker, I will continue in the future. I will enter this particular report in the Record.Report of the Ecumenical Church Leaders Delegation to Mexico--March 28-                             April 6, 2001                              introduction       From March 28 to April 6, 2001, five Canadian church      leaders travelled to Mexico as part of an ecumenical fact-     finding delegation organized by the Inter-Church Committee on      Human Rights in Latin America (ICCHRLA). The delegation was      made up of: Rev. Glen Davis, Moderator of the Presbyterian      Church of Canada; Mgr. Jean Gagnon, Auxiliary Bishop of      Quebec City; Archbishop Thomas Morgan, Anglican Diocese of      Saskatoon; the Very Rev. Robert Smith, former Moderator of      the United Church of Canada; Sr. Priscilla Solomon, Canadian      Religious Conference; Suzanne Rumsey and Kathy Price, Inter-     Church Committee on Human Rights in Latin America.       The delegation's mission was to explore the impact of the      North American Free Trade Agreement--along with free trade      policies and legislative changes that were implemented prior      to 1994 in order to make Mexico ``NAFTA-ready''--on human      rights. The delegation's time in Mexico focused on three      areas: visits with indigenous and non-indigenous communities      in the Sierra Tarahumara; visits with communities of small      farmers in Central Chihuahua; visits with workers and      migrants in the Special Border Zone of Ciudad Juarez.                         the sierra tarahumara       In the southern mountain region of the state of Chihuahua,      known as the Sierra Tarahumara, our delegation visited      indigenous communities where we heard how privatization of      state Forestry Services and the lifting of controls over      logging--policies implemented in the lead up to the signing      of the North American Free Trade Agreement--have coincided      with the arrival of transnational forestry companies and      intensive, largely unregulated logging. This has resulted in      the denuding of forests that once provided edible plants,      medicinal herbs and a livelihood to the Tepahuane, Raramuri      and Huichol indigenous peoples, along with growing      desertification, depletion of soils and shrinking of      agricultural harvests. Meanwhile, we were told that NAFTA has      enabled cheap wood imports to enter Mexico from countries      such as the United States, Chile, Brazil and even Russia (via      the U.S.), driving down the price that indigenous communities      can obtain for the timber resources on their land,      contributing to growing poverty as well as pressure to cut      down more and more trees in order to make a living.       ``We want the impoverishment of our people to end,'' states      a simple yet eloquent letter we were given, signed by 73      members of the indigenous community of San Alonso, who asked      us to pass it on to you. We have attached their letter to      ours and ask you to read its urgent plea for controls to stop      the degradation of their environment by the rapacious      operations of multinational corporations. Efforts by      communities to halt these practices have been largely      ignored, or worse still, met with threats and violence.       The Catholic Diocese of the Tarahumara told us in      unequivocal terms that NAFTA is to blame for the increased      clearcutting by multinational companies that are destroying      the region's forests. Indeed, the Diocese told us they have      brought a complaint to the Commission for Environmental      Cooperation in Montreal citing violations of Articles 14 and      15 of the NAFTA side agreement but to no avail. In ``Our Word      About the Destruction of the Forest'' the Diocese states:      ``Laws have been imposed that favour companies from other      countries . . . These laws have enabled much wealth to leave      the Sierra, leaving behind growing poverty . . . Exploitation      of the forest has brought no benefits to the majority of the      inhabitants of the Sierra . . . If we do not halt the      destruction, we are heading for death.''       In the community of Baborigame, we heard how 48 percent of      children die before the age of five from preventable diseases      that result from poverty-induced chronic malnutrition. We      personally witnessed the desperation of a mother whose baby      would have died, had the Carmelite sisters, who run a small      dispensary, not taken him to the nearest hospital, three      hours away. The Carmelite sisters also told us that the      situation is worsening; indigenous people who once ate corn      and beans, now often can only afford to eat a soup of ground      corn and lately they have witnessed a new cause of death,      previously unheard of in indigenous communities; suicides due      to sheer hopelessness.       In such a context, many indigenous inhabitants feel they      have little option but to choose between two terrible      alternatives: abandon their land and migrate north in search      of work (a process that is causing family, community and      cultural disintegration) or turn to cultivating drugs like      marijuana and poppies, illicit crops which unlike others,      fetch a price that enables them to feed their families. Drug      trafficking is present throughout the Sierra because there is      no work, we were told by the Diocese of Tarahumara. ``The      people need to survive in this impoverished mountain      region.'' We were outraged at the price these people are      paying for their survival.       We also heard from the respected, church-based Commission      for Solidarity and the Defence of Human Rights (COSYDDHAC)      how instead of providing solutions to the hard economic      realities and growing poverty that have forced some into drug      cultivation, the Mexican government has militarized the      region. COSYDDHAC has documented arbitrary detentions,      torture, disappearances and assassinations committed by the      police and military, who justify their actions in the name of      the ``war on drugs''. In a joint letter to the Mexican      government that was shared with us, Bishop Jose Luis Dibildox      and 28 priests, religious and lay workers stated: ``The      methods used by the army create a doubt in the minds of the      public as to what is the real aim of their actions, which in      some instances seem to be responding to other interests, such      as the militarization of Mexico, especially in indigenous      regions.''       In Baborigame, we witnessed the trauma and terror that      repression by state security forces is causing amongst      inhabitants of the community. We witnessed the pain of people      whose relatives were shot down in cold blood, victims who      included a local indigenous leader. We share the grave      concern of the Tarahumara Diocese that ``instead of seeking      ways to ease tensions, and bring about well-being and peace,      we see actions that will bring war and death.''                The Farming Region of Central Chihuahua       In rural communities in the state of Chihuahua, we      witnessed the terrible human impact on small farmers of      policies that have consciously neglected and excluded them.      Since the implementation of policies that were entrenched in      NAFTA, communities where families once made a living from      farming basic grains for local markets and their own      consumption have found it increasingly difficult to survive.      As a result, men of working age are forced to abandon their      farms and migrate north in search of temporary jobs. Many of      them work illegally in the United States, having been unable      to obtain a work visa. As a result, they are paid      exploitative wages and denied the rights and benefits      accorded to others.       The suffering caused by these realities was evident in our      conversations with inhabitants of the communities we visited.      ``We have become half men because we are no longer able to      provide for our families. We can no longer be husbands to our      wives, or fathers to our children,'' we were told by     small farmers who must leave their communities in search of      work for 4 to 5 months at a time. This means the women, as      they told us, ``are left to assume the roles of both women      and men'', taking on a triple work load of caring for their      homes and families, looking after their farms, and often      seeking paid work in order to feed their children.       The exodus from the countryside, as we were told by the      respected Democratic Campesino Organization, as well as many      of the farming families we met with, is a direct result of      economic policies that were enacted to make Mexico NAFTA-     ready. Unlike in the United States--and to a lesser extent in      Canada--where basic grains producers continue to be      subsidized for the costs of production, subisidies to corn      producers in Mexico were competely phased out in 1997, 12      years ahead of schedule, thus creating an unlevel playing      field. Moreover, since NAFTA came into effect in 1994,      tariffs have been lifted and cheap corn and beans from the      U.S. have flooded the Mexican market, making it impossible      for Mexico producers to compete. In addition, free market      policies that began prior to 1994 but which have been made      permanent in NAFTA, have resulted in the elimination of      credit for small farmers, leaving them at the mercy of local      loan sharks who charge usurious interest rates.       All of these policies have had a predictable effect, one      which was impossible to ignore in the faces of those we met      with: increasing poverty and increasing desperation as      families worry how they will get by from one day to the next.      As in the Sierra Tarahumara, we heard of families reduced to      a diet of cornmeal soup, and of the existence of preventable      diseases due to chronic malnutrition. It is this situation,      in which vast numbers are robbed of their very dignity, that      is forcing people to leave in search of other means to      survive, provoking family and community disintegration in the      process.       Policies associated with NAFTA have also effectively      privatized what were once communal or ejido lands, that      provided rural and indigenous communities with a guaranteed      land base in perpetuity. Unable to get a just price for their      products and saddled with overwhelming and unpayable debts,      Mexican farmers are increasingly being forced to sell those      lands, leading to growing concentration of land in few      hands. Those buying up the land or renting from farmers      unable to make a go of it,--including multinationals like      PepsiCo--have used vast extensions to produce potatoes for      the fast food markets of the three NAFTA countries. In an      arid state where we were told that ``water is gold,''      PepsiCo was able to obtain access to wells, which small      farmers had been denied, and its large scale irrigation      has reduced the already alarmingly low water table. This,      together with extensive use of chemical fertilizers and      pesticides has meant that arable land is being destroyed,      and with it, the means for rural Mexicans to be guaranteed      the basic human right to adequate nutrition and food      security.       It is clear to us that one of the factors that is fueling      this crisis in the countryside is that a significant      proportion of Mexico's gross domestic product is being used      to service its foreign debt. We wish to share with you what      we were told by the Democratic Campeesino Organization, a      position which we support: ``Developing countries like Mexico      need to have food security and policies that guarantee that      security, because if they don't, the 40 million people who      live in poverty and the 20 million people who live in extreme      poverty in Mexico will continue to migrate north.''                             Ciudad Juarez       In the border city of Ciudad Juarez--home to 397 maquila      factories employing 281,000 workers that assemble electronics      products and car parts for export to the United States and      Canada--we saw where many whose means of survival has been      eliminated under free trade in the Tarahumara Sierra, or the      failed farms of the plains of Chihuahua, end up. It is a      reality we would not wish on anyone. The political leaders of      this hemisphere have, on numerous occasions, told their      citizens it will take time for the benefits of free trade to      be realized and equitably shared. In Ciudad Juarez we came      face to face with what 30 years of free trade has wrought on      countless human lives. That is because the city has operated      as a free trade zone since the 1970s, when the first maquila      assembly factories were established under rules that provide      generous incentives for foreign investors, while workers are      paid what can only be called exploitative wages and denied      rights which Canadian workers take for granted. What we saw      in Cuidad Juarez is nothing less than economic slavery.       Until the recent recession in the United States,      unemployment in Cuidad Juarez stood at an astonishing 0      percent. Yet 58 percent of those fully employed workers and      their families live below the poverty line. Of that total 18      percent live in poverty and 40 percent live in extreme      poverty. In 1976, a maquila worker earned a salary in pesos      that was the equivalent of US$11 a day, yet the value of that      salary is now as little as just US$4.50 a day, due to      currency devaluations under free trade. As one maquila worker      put it, ``You have the choice to clothe yourself or to feed      yourself.''       What does a maquila salary buy? We visited several colonias      where maquila workers have no choice but to live and this was      how one member of our delegation described his reaction: ``I      stood in the dust and saw houses pulled together, framed with      packing pallets from the maquila, and covered with cardboard.      I saw the barrels that once carried chemicals to the maquilas      with their dwindling supply of tepid, unpotable water. And      you know what I discovered? I discovered that these people      are employed 10 to 16 hours a day producing cheap microwaves,      cheap TVs, cheap computers for Canada. And our government      says, ``NAFTA is a good deal for Canada!' Mr. Prime Minister,      you have not been to this shantytown. A day's work for a      salary equivalent to the cost of a jug of milk is not a good      deal for anyone! If my car is cheaper because of what I saw      here, that is unacceptable.''       In Juarez, we saw with our own eyes what a local priest had      told us, you can work for a Fortune 500 company and live in a      cardboard house. Indeed, we were appalled at the living      conditions of thousands upon thousands of people who exist      without decent housing, and without access to essential      social services like water, sanitation, health care, and      education.       Time and again, we heard from young workers about the      dehumanizing impact of the highly controlled environment of      the maquilas. Assembly lines are often sped up by supervisors      in order to meet high production quotas, approval must be      obtained for bathroom breaks, which are carefully timed and      future breaks denied if the time is exceeded. Workers told us      they are treated ``like a machine, a cog in the wheel.''      Exhausted young women workers, demoralized by salaries that      do not afford the means for anything more than basic      survival, added: ``The maquilas have robbed us of our dreams      for a better future.''       Workers also told us they are fearful about the long term      effects of being exposed to chemical solvents without      adequate protection, in denial of their right to a healthy      work environment. As we heard repeatedly: ``The only      right people have here is the right of a job. But in      reality that's nothing more than the right to be      exploited.''       None of the maquila workers we spoke to in Juarez had the      right to unionize freely to defend their rights. The      experience of workers who have tried to challenge such a      situation was brought home painfully to us by the testimony      we received from maquila worker, Pedro Lopez, from the state      of Tamaulipas. Mr. Lopez told us about his experience trying      to help organize an independence union at the Duro Bag      Company, a maquila where labour rights were routinely      violated. The first such initiative to occur under the new      administration of President Vicente Fox, the vote took place      on March 2, in what can only be described as conditions of      fear, intimidation and violence. Workers were locked inside      the factory and had to declare their vote verbally (rather      than a secret ballot) in the presence of heavily armed men      (who the day before had entered the plant with machine guns),      hired by the ``official'' union affiliated with Mexico's      former ruling PRI party. International and Mexican observers      were not allowed to enter. Needless to say, the independent      union lost the vote. The following day, Mr. Lopez had to be      hospitalized when his vehicle was forced off the road by two      others, the ``accident'' leaving a scar still visible on his      face.       The 3 metre high fence that runs along the border with the      United States--a sign that desperate people from other parts      of Mexico can come to Juarez to be a source of cheap labour      in the maquila factories but are not welcome any further      north--was always visible during our stay. Visible too was      the militarized U.S. border patrol, posted along the fence at      regular intervals. Borders between Canada, the United States      and Mexico under NAFTA have been opened to the free passage      of goods and capital but not to people.       It is deeply troubling to us that a wall has been erected      on the border between the United States and Mexico under      NAFTA, in contrast to the experience of Europe, where the      Berlin Wall has been dismantled and the European Union has      opened up its borders to increased movement of workers      between member countries. As we heard from social      organizations in Juarez, militarizing the border does not      stop those desperate for the means to adequately provide for      their families from trying to get across. It only makes the      crossing more dangerous, as those attempting to get into the      US take greater risks, such as picking routes that require      days walking in the desert or other hazards. A study by the      University of Houston recorded over 300 deaths during border      crossings in 2000.                                  ____ A Visit to Northern Mexico Shows Just How Badly Economic Democracy is  Needed--But Will the Summit of the Americas Address That Challenge?--                               April 2001       Mexican President Vicente Fox's arrival in Canada is sure      to occasion, on the part of apologists eager to have the      Summit of the Americas extend free market policies, rhetoric      that would be more suitable for the Second Coming. For they      regard it as gospel that it was the North American Free Trade      Agreement that brought democracy--and President Fox--to      Mexico.       Fox is, by all accounts, a gifted and concerned leader, but      I'd like to ask him and his NAFTA partners how they square      the supposed arrival of democracy with the fence--steel,      chain-linked, three metres high and guarded by armed Border      Patrols at regular intervals--that I saw along Mexico's      border with the United States.       It's a strange, capricious fence. Trucks roar through its      gates night and day, loaded     with goods. Money floods over it; investments heading south,      profits heading north. Canadians and Americans pass through,      with only a cursory glance from officials. For Mexicans--at      least, for the now 58 percent of Mexicans who live in      grinding poverty despite their country's ``rapid economic      growth''--it's a different story. The fence is there to keep      them out.       Earlier this month, I travelled to northern Mexico with      other Canadian church leaders to see what has happened to      those the fence was built to retain.       In the once densely-forested mountains of the Tarahumara      Sierra, we met with the indigenous community of San Alonso      who gave us a letter for our government, signed with their      thumbprints, that pleads for ``an end to the impoverishment      of our people''. People here once lived from agriculture and      from selling small amounts of timber. But changes to forestry      controls under free trade have brought multinational      companies and clear cutting. Soils for food crops are      eroding. ``Laws have been imposed that favour companies from      other countries,'' says the local Catholic Church, referring      to legislation that paved the way for NAFTA. ``These laws      have enabled much wealth to be taken from the Sierra, leaving      behind growing poverty.''       We saw the impact in the ulcerated, sightless corneas of a      child whose mother had nothing to feed him but a soup of      ground corn. We sat with an indigenous woman who had brought      her dying baby to a dispensary run by nuns, and heard that 48      percent of infants in the Sierra die before the age of five      because of chronic malnutrition. Other than suicide--a new      phenomenon in indigenous communities, the nuns told us--many      see only two alternatives: cultivate marijuana or poppies for      drug traffickers or migrate north in search of work,      abandoning ancestral land, breaking up families, and      splintering communities.       In the farmland of Chihuahua, families who used to make a      living growing corn and beans have also seen their livelihood      destroyed by so-called free trade. Promised that NAFTA would      greatly improve their lot, Mexican corn producers saw      subsidies eliminated by 1997--12 years ahead of schedule--     along with credit for small farmers. Meanwhile, the lifting      of tariffs has allowed a flood of cheap corn and beans from      the U.S., where farmers can access 5 percent loans and      subsidies at 46 percent of the cost of production. Unable to      compete, Mexican farming families are struggling to survive.      Once again, we heard how people are reduced to eating little      other than corn and we witnessed the agony of families torn      asunder, communities dispersed, as former farmers are forced      north to the squalor of the border or the perils of crossing      illegally into the United States, in search of the means to      sustain their children.       Our last stop was Juarez, on the border with Texas, a city      rapidly expanding with newcomers from the Sierra, from      abandoned farms, and other parts of Mexico that have only got      poorer under NAFTA. Many have been lured by the promise of a      job in one of some 400 maquila factories that assemble car      parts or electronics for Fortune 500 companies selling to      North American consumers. ``The maquila has stolen our      dreams of a better future'', exhausted women barely out of      their teens, told us, explaining the pressures of the      assembly line, impossibly high production quotas,      repetitive motion injuries and salaries of just US $4.50 a      day.       Others told us about employment conditions that beggar      description: forced to work unprotected in the presence of      dangerous chemicals, their right to organize unions thwarted      by managers who bring in thugs armed with automatic weapons.      Earning in a day the equivalent of a two-litre jug of milk,      workers are condemned to slums, without potable water or      sanitation, where many live in hovels made of discarded      pallets, covered with cardboard.       ``Good fences make good neighbors.'' That's what the poet      Robert Frost's neighbour told him one spring day when they      were out surveying the winter-ravaged stone wall that ran      between their properties. Frost wasn't so sure. He wrote,      ``Before I built a wall I'd ask to know what I was walling in      or walling out, and to whom I was like to give offense.''       The work that Messrs. Fox, Bush, Chretien and their      colleagues do this weekend will be an offense if it does not      address the unconscionable disparity between rich nations,      like Canada and the United States, and poor nations, like      Mexico. Policies such as those enshrined in NAFTA, which      guarantee the free play of market forces, are an offense      because they deny that which is the first democratic right--     the right not to starve to death. Then they compound the      offence by building barriers--steel, chain-linked, three      metres high--to wall the hungry out.       The day the fence is no longer necessary will be the day to      celebrate the arrival of democracy--true democracy--in the      hemisphere.                          ____________________
