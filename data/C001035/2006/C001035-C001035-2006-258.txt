President, one of the issues that will undoubtedly come up during the debate on the port security bill has to do with the scanning of containers. Some people have asked: Why don't we scan 100 percent of the 11 million containers coming into this country? And the answer is simply that it is not practical with the current technology. The bill that is before us authorizes three pilot projects in three foreign ports where we would take a look at the feasibility and practicality and the implications of 100 percent scanning.  There is 100 percent screening. There is a difference between screening a container, which means gathering information on each and every container and doing a sophisticated computer analysis to determine which are of higher risk, versus scanning each container with an x-ray-type machine or some other method or a physical inspection.  The problem of trying to scan 100 percent of all containers is best summed up by a letter that we recently received from the Supply Chain Security Coalition. This is a coalition of some of the largest and most knowledgeable stakeholders in the supply chain's system, including the Retail Industry Leaders Association.  The letter says:       One hundred percent scanning proposals and amendments      advocating such a proposal could potentially actually      decrease security by forcing containers to sit for extended      periods of time, putting them at greater risk of tampering,      and would divert resources away from the current risk      assessment approach. In addition--And this is the key point--     such a mandate has the potential to significantly impede the      flow of commerce and damage the U.S. and global economy.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of that letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the Retail Industry      Leaders Association, I am     writing to urge you to support strong and carefully crafted      port security legislation that builds on the current      multilayered, risk assessment approach that has effectively      protected our nation's seaports over the last several years.      I also urge you, in the strongest terms possible, to oppose      any legislation that would require all U.S. bound cargo      containers to be ``scanned'' for radiation and density, so      called 100% scanning legislation. While we strongly support      improving the security of our nation's seaports, 100%      scanning proposals have the potential to do more harm than      good.       The Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA) is the trade      association of the largest and fastest growing companies in      the retail industry. Its members include retailers, product      manufacturers, and service suppliers, which together account      for more than $1.5 trillion in annual sales. RILA members      operate more than 100,000 stores, manufacturing facilities      and distribution centers, have facilities in all 50 states,      and provide millions of jobs domestically and worldwide.       We understand that key committees in the Senate has come to      an agreement on a port security bill that may be taken up as      soon as tomorrow, September 8th, 2006, and that the      legislation is based on provisions from earlier bills drafted      in the Homeland Security & Government Affairs Committee, the      Commerce, Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the      Finance Committee. Each of those bills contain important      provisions that will help improve our nation's port security      laws by building upon and recognizing the effectiveness of      the well-established security measures our government      currently has in place. RILA supports legislation that builds      upon this proven approach, which is why we worked to help      pass port security legislation in the House, H.R. 4954, The      SAFE Ports Act. It is our hope that the Senate bill will      closely mirror the House legislation, which received      overwhelming bipartisan support.       However, I also strongly urge you to oppose any legislation      that would require that all U.S. bound cargo containers be      scanned for radiation and density, so called ``100%      scanning'' amendments. Such proposals may at first glance      appear to improve security, but in reality, they would impose      immense costs on our economy and foreign relations without      improving the security of our international trading systems.       First, a 100% scanning mandate is unrealistic since the      technology does not yet exist to do this efficiently and with      a high degree of accuracy. We are not aware of any credible      technology to actually analyze the millions of density images      that would be taken of outbound cargo containers, meaning      such images would have to be reviewed one by one by a port      official or Customs officer. Second, this mandate could      actually decrease security by forcing containers to sit for      extended periods of time, putting them at greater risk of      tampering.       In addition, forcing all containers to be scanned--     including the vast majority of those that pose no risk--would      divert scarce security resources away from the successful      risk assessment approach currently utilized by the      government. This approach uses sophisticated risk-analysis      tools to determine which containers pose a risk and ensures      those containers are handled appropriately. It is important      for Senators to remember that the Department of Homeland      Security currently uses a risk-based targeting approach to      inspect inbound cargo. All cargo manifests are submitted at      least 24 hours prior to loading on a vessel and the Automated      Targeting System (ATS) uses complex, rule-based formulas to      assign a numerical score and identify at-risk containers. CBP      then inspects 100% of all containers deemed high-risk.       Finally, a 100% scanning mandate has the potential to      significantly impede the flow of commerce and do damage to      the economy. According a June 2006 study conducted by the      RAND Corporation, 100% scanning would delay the movement      cargo containers by 5.5 hours per container. With 11 to 12      million containers entering the U.S. every year, it is      obvious that of 100% scanning mandate would bring global      commerce and the flow goods to a virtual standstill. This      would severely damage the U.S. economy, not only by denying      consumers access to thousands of products they need, but also      by preventing the delivery of material and other inputs that      U.S. manufactures need.       Rather than mandating 100% scanning, port security      legislation should authorize additional testing and      evaluation of scanning technology. Several of the relevant      port security bills address this issue by calling for pilot      projects and other evaluations to test the effectiveness and      operational capability to conduct increased container      scanning, including the ``GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security      Act'' passed by the Senate Homeland Security Committee and      the House SAFE Ports Act. These provisions represent the best      way to address this issue and answer important operational      and economic questions critical to understanding how to      effectively implement container scanning.       Retail companies are among the largest and most      knowledgeable stakeholders in the supply chain system and      administer the most extensive and efficient logistics      operations in the world. The industry has worked hand-in-hand      with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and      specifically with the Coast Guard and Customs and Border      Protection to ensure that our customers, employees, and the      nation's seaports remain safe and that the nation's economy      remains strong. We take a back seat to no industry in our      support for strong and carefully crafted port security      legislation, and we urge the Senate to move quickly to pass      such a bill as soon as possible.       Thank you for your consideration of our views. We look      forward to working with you on this critically important      issue. Should you have any questions, please contact Paul T.      Kelly, Senior Vice President for Government Affairs or Allen      Thompson, Vice President for Global Supply Chain Policy.           Sincerely,                                                    Sandy Kennedy,                                                        President.
