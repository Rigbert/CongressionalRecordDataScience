President, I rise to engage the distinguished subcommittee chairman, Senator Shelby, and the distinguished ranking member, Senator Lautenberg, in a brief colloquy in order to make clear the intent behind some language contained in the Senate Appropriations Committee's report accompanying S. 1143, the FY 2000 Transportation appropriations bill.  I want to first thank the distinguished managers of this bill for their assistance last year in securing approximately $1.2 million in FY 99 funding for advanced engineered wood composites for bridge construction to be conducted by the University of Maine's Advanced Wood Composite Center. As both Senator Shelby and Senator Lautenberg may recall, the University of Maine is the institution that pioneered this technology and is currently working with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) in this area of research and development.  On page 95 of this year's Senate Appropriations Committee Report accompanying S. 1143, it states in part ``The Committee is interested in research to develop advanced engineering and wood composites for bridge construction and has provided $1.2 million for that purpose within this program.''  I want to inquire of the distinguished managers of this bill if it is their intent that the University of Maine's Advanced Wood Composites Center is to receive the funding referenced by this part of the Committee's report, in order that the University can continue to support FHWA's research in this vital area.
