 We now leave for another month the Export-Import Bank, which is responsible for the creation and retaining of jobs in America.  We all talk about jobs in America, but the Speaker has said, again, that the failure to pass this bill is losing jobs right now. And yet my Republican friends, in tipping their hat to the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, say we are not going to consider that, as they did last month in July. I know we haven't gotten out of July yet, but we will go through August, and then we will go through September.  Mr. Fincher tells me he thinks that bill will be brought to the floor in some form or another in September, but it will have cost us jobs and competitiveness overseas with the 60 countries that have an export-import bank that are making sure that the purchases of their goods made in their countries are cheaper than the goods sold in our country. That costs American jobs.                              {time}  1315  We ought to reject this rule, and we ought to do what the Speaker of the House said we ought to do; treat one another with respect, and let the House work its will.  There are 240-plus, maybe 250, maybe 260, maybe 270 votes. You only need 218 to pass the Export-Import Bank on this floor.  I will yield to anybody who says: No, Mr. Hoyer, you are wrong; it doesn't have the majority vote.
