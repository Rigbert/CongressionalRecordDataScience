. manufacturers, and we are very hopeful this does move ahead so our country does not confront at the end of this year, as the European Union has suggested it might, take action if we have not corrected the deficiency which the WTO has found. I hope that we could move that bill before we leave here.  The leader mentioned several conference reports which will come up next week. Which are the most likely? Energy was mentioned. Energy was a possibility for this week. How confident is leadership that energy will come next week? This is a complicated bill, a very important bill; and I would ask you to comment, and I would ask you to facilitate the availability of this bill as soon as possible, and more than 24 hours before because it is a complicated bill. We need time to review it; and as the leader knows, we have not been included, from our perspective, in the conference proceedings so we do not know what is in this bill at this point in time.  First, how confident is the gentleman that the conference report will come next week; and, second, can we be assured that we will receive a copy of the report and the accompanying bill hopefully by Friday afternoon?  Mr. DeLAY. Madam Speaker, as the gentleman knows, we do not have to be in session for us to get our work done in conference committees or other committees. People are going to be working the rest of this week to finalize what will be submitted to formal proceedings of the conference committee on the energy bill, the comprehensive energy bill. The gentleman is correct in that it is a very complicated bill. Obviously we want to make sure that Members have enough time to review it so they can vote with some sort of understanding of what is in the bill. Obviously, I cannot predict when the final proceedings on the energy bill will be, but we will get to theMembers as soon as we have the paperwork so they can look at the bill and be informed as to how to vote on it.                              {time}  1415
