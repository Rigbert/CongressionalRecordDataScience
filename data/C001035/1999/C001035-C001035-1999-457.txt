President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until 1 p.m. on Monday, April 26. I further ask that on Monday, immediately following the prayer, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed to have expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved, and there then be a period of morning business until the hour of 3:30 p.m. with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.  I further ask unanimous consent that at 3:30 p.m. on Monday, the Senate resume the motion to proceed to S. 96, the Y2K legislation, and that there be 2 hours of debate equally divided in the usual form. I finally ask unanimous consent that the vote on invoking cloture on the motion to proceed occur at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, with the mandatory quorum waived.
