Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, in 1972, Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote the following in the case of United States v. Topco Associates, Inc.: ``Antitrust laws in general, and the Sherman Act in particular, are the Magna Carta of free enterprise. They are as important to the preservation of economic freedom and our free enterprise system as the Bill of Rights is to the protection of our fundamental personal freedoms. And the freedom guaranteed each and every business, no matter how small, is the freedom to compete, to assert with vigor, imagination, devotion, and ingenuity whatever economic muscle it can muster.''  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this legislation. The Wright amendment is anticompetitive, there is no doubt about it, and it has increased the cost of long-distance travel to people who live in the Dallas-Fort Worth area by as much as a third as compared to other markets with other airlines.  What this legislation does is continue vestiges of the Wright amendment and its anticompetition policy on until at least the year 2025. If we think the Wright amendment is bad, we should get rid of it once and for all, and remember, Congress imposed the Wright amendment back over 15 years ago.  Now, what this bill does is it codifies an agreement among private and local government parties that constitute per se violations of the antitrust laws. With limited exceptions, the Wright amendment expressly insulates Dallas-Fort Worth from interstate international air passenger competition from Dallas Love Field.  Now, let us stop and think about this because this bill would provide a congressional approval, requiring the demolition of existing gates at Love Field, some of which are privately owned and utilized by airlines to offer additional air passenger service to points across the United States.  The agreement also prohibits Southwest Airlines from offering service from the DFW Airport until 2025 and limits the ability of all airlines to offer service from Love Field and maintains a ban on most interstate flights from Love Field to 42 States. Now, that means if you live in the 42 States that this bill seeks to protect, you are going to pay more to come to Dallas-Ft. Worth, no two ways about it.  There was a memo leaked out of the Justice Department that says that thisagreement, which allows Southwest to stay out of DFW for 19 years, would be a hard core per se violation of the Sherman Act.  Now, proponents of this bill will claim that the antitrust laws are unaffected by it and do not be fooled. Why? According to 54 American Jurisprudence 2nd, Monopolies and Restraints of Trade, No. 243, the Hornbook on antitrust law, says: ``In determining whether subsequent Federal legislation has granted immunity from the antitrust laws, a court should reconcile the operation of both statutory schemes, where this is possible.''  A court looking to this legislation will be forced to ignore the antitrust laws because the legislation contains mandatory obligations that the parties engage in contact that violates the per se violations of the antitrust laws.  So this compromise is a compromise in name only, and the result is exactly the same, creating implied antitrust immunity by eliminating a cause of action for conduct that presents a clear violation of the antitrust laws.  Now, we are going to hear that the Wright amendment is a local issue, and they are right. It is a local issue for the Members of Congress who represent the 42 States whose residents are held captive by the anticompetitive output restriction/cartel that this legislation perpetuates.                              {time}  1900  We have got to have the courage to stand up for consumers, our constituents who vote for us, and adopt the pro-competitive goals of the Airline Deregulation Act by defeating this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
