 President, Senator Moynihan and I are introducing Legislation today to spell out more specifically the requirements for the office of Deputy Director for Demand Reduction at the Office of National Drug Control Policy. I know it is Senator Moynihan's view, and mine, that this office requires an incumbent of the highest qualifications in the demand reduction area. This is especially true at this time. We have seen 4 years of rising teenage drug use in this country. We have seen initiatives that move us perilously close to legalizing a dangerous drug. We have seen the cynical exploitation of the public's trust in order to do this. In response, we need credible, visible leadership of the highest caliber in the Nation's chief demand reduction office. These qualifications were what Congress had in mindwhen we created the Drug Czar's office and the position of Deputy Director for Demand Reduction. Today, we are introducing legislation that will spell out more clearly this intent.  Last year, Congress increased funding to restore the Drug Czar's office to effective staffing levels. This year we will be reviewing the reauthorization of the office. Congress remains deeply interested in ONDCP and I and others will be working to ensure that it is meeting the expectations that we have in it.  As we work during this Congress to ensure a drug-free future for our children, we must have an individual in charge of our national demand reduction efforts who can command the respect of parents, doctors, treatment and prevention specialist, and the public. I am pleased to join Senator Moynihan in this effort. Our legislation will ensure that we will see candidates for this important post who command universal respect. I welcome the support of our colleagues. I look forward to having someone of outstanding capabilities with whom we can work and in whom the public can have confidence.                                 ______                                       By
