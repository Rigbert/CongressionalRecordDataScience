President, I begin by thanking the nominees' home State Senators for working with us on this nomination and by commending the majority leader and our assistant majority leader for bringing this matter to successful conclusion today.  Callie Granade is the second nominee being considered from Alabama in the last several weeks and the second confirmed to fill an emergency vacancy. On November 6, the Senate confirmed Judge Karon Bowdre by a vote of 98 to 0 to a longstanding vacancy on the Northern District of Alabama District Court. Today the Senate will take final action to fill a longstanding vacancy on the Southern District of Alabama District Court.  This nomination was received on September 5 and reported favorably to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee just a few days before the Senate adjourned last December. It is being taken up in the first days of our return. These Alabama district court vacancies have persisted for years while Senators were unable to agree on acceptable nominees with the previous administration. Unlike the nomination of Ken Simon, which languished for more than 6 months in 2000 without a hearing, both Karon Bowdre and Callie Granade have been considered promptly. I congratulate the nominee and her family on her confirmation today.  Confirmation of Ms. Granade will be the seventh confirmation filling a vacancy designated as a judicial emergency since I became chairman last summer. Unfortunately, the White House has yet to work with home-State Senators to send nominees for an additional 15 judicial emergency vacancies and 31 federal trial court vacancies.  With today's confirmation, the Senate has confirmed three additional judges since returning late last month. The Senate will have confirmed 31 judges since the change in majority last summer.  Of course, I have yet to chair the Judiciary Committee for a full year; it has been barely 6 months. But the confirmations we have achieved in those 6 months are already comparable to the year-end totals for 1997, 1999 and 2000 and nearly twice as many as were confirmed under a Republican majority in the Senate in 1996.  The 1996 session was the second year of the last Republican chairmanship. In that 1996 session, only 17 judges were confirmed all year and none were confirmed to the Court of Appeals--none. I expect and intend to work hard on additional judicial nominations through this session and to exceed the number of judges confirmed during the 1996 session.  The Judiciary Committee held its first hearing of the session on our second day in session, January 24, for Judge Michael Melloy, a nominee to the 8th Circuit from Iowa, and district court nominees from Arizona, Iowa, Texas, Louisiana and the District of Columbia, a total of six judicial nominations.  I have set another hearing on the nomination of Judge Charles Pickering for the 5th Circuit for this Thursday, February 7, 2002.  I am working to hold another confirmation hearing for judicial nominations, as well, before the end of February, even though it is a short month with a week's recess.  I noted on January 25 in my statement to the Senate that we inherited a frayed process and are working hard to repair the damage of the last several years.  I have already laid out a constructive program of suggestions that would help in that effort and help return the confirmation process to one that is a cooperative, bipartisan effort. I have included suggestions for the White House, that it work with Democrats as well as Republicans, that it encourage rather than forestall the use of bipartisan selection commissions, and that it consider carefully the views of home-State Senators.  This past summer, by the time I became chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Federal court vacancies already topped 100 and were rising to 111. Since July, we have worked hard and the Senate has been diligent in considering and confirming 31 judges, thereby beginning the process of lowering the vacancies on our federal courts. Since I became chairman, 26 additional vacancies have arisen. Still, we have been able to outpace this high level of attrition and lower the vacancies to under 100.  During the last 6\1/2\ years when a Republican majority controlled the process, the vacancies rose from 65 to over 100, an increase of almost 60 percent.  By contrast, we are now working to keep these numbers moving in the right directions. Our majority leader, with the help of the assistant majority leader, is clearing the calendar of judicial nominations and the Senate has proceeded to vote on every one of them. This is one of the reforms thatsignals a return to normalcy for the Senate, which had gotten away from such practices over the past 6 years. Since the change in majority, judicial nominees have not been held on the calendar for months and months or held over without action or returned to the President without action.  I have observed that to make real progress will take the cooperation of the White House. The most progress can be made most quickly if the White House would begin working with home-State Senators to identify fair-minded, nonideological, consensus nominees to fill these court vacancies. One of the reasons that the committee was able to work as quickly as it has and the Senate has been able to confirm 31 judges in the last few months is because those nominations were strongly supported as consensus nominees.  I have heard of too many situations in too many States involving too many reasonable and moderate home-State Senators in which the White House has demonstrated no willingness to work with home-state Senators to fill judicial vacancies cooperatively. As we move forward, I urge the White House to show greater inclusiveness and flexibility and to help make this a truly bipartisan enterprise. Logjams exist in a number of settings.  To make real progress, repair the damage that has been done over previous years, and build bridges toward a more cooperative process, there is much that the White House could do to work more cooperatively with all home-State Senators, including Democratic Senators.  Of course, more than two-thirds of the Federal court vacancies continue to be on the district courts. The administration has been slow to make nominations to the vacancies on the Federal trial courts. In the last 5 months of last year, the Senate confirmed a higher percentage of the President's trial court nominees, 22 out of 36, than a Republican majority had confirmed in the first session of either of the last two Congresses with a Democratic President.  Last year the President did not make nominations to almost 80 percent of the current trial court vacancies. As we began this session, 55 out of 69 vacancies were without a nominee. In late January, the White House finally sent nominations for another 24 of those trial court vacancies.  After the committee receives the indication that the nominees have the support of their home-State Senators and after the committee has received ABA peer reviews, these recent nominations will then be eligible to be included in committee hearings. Because the White House shifted the time at which the ABA does its evaluation of nominees to the post-nomination period, these 24 nominees are unlikely to have completed files ready for evaluation until after the Easter recess. Even then, over two and one-half dozen of the Federal trial court vacancies, 31, may still be without eligible nominees.  We have accomplished more, and at a faster pace, than in years past. We have worked harder and faster than previously on judicial nominations, despite the unprecedented difficulties being faced by the Nation and the Senate.  I am encouraged that this confirmation today was not delayed by extended, unexplained, anonymous holds on the Senate Executive Calendar, the type of hold that characterized so much of the previous 6\1/2\ years. Majority Leader Daschle has moved swiftly on judicial nominees reported to the calendar.  I thank all Senators who have helped in our efforts and assisted in the hard work to review and consider the dozens of judicial nominations we have reported and confirmed. I thank, in particular, the Senators who serve on the Judiciary Committee. I thank them not only for their kind words, but for their helpful action since this summer.  As our action today demonstrates, again, we are moving ahead to fill judicial vacancies with nominees who have strong bipartisan support.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an editorial from the Washington Post.  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 27, 2002]                          Mr. Leahy and Judges       Sen. Patrick Leahy, Democratic chairman of the Senate      Judiciary Committee, gave a speech on the Senate floor Friday      that, on the surface, seemed like another round of partisan      warfare over judges. But embedded within the rhetoric was a      significant step toward bringing some comity back to the      judicial nominations process. Mr. Leahy promised ``steadiness      in the hearing process'' and ``regular hearings'' on judges      at a pace faster than the Senate has managed in recent years.      He promised also that these hearings would not be weighted      too heavily toward relatively uncontroversial district judges      but would give appeals court judges a fair shake too--     including specifically a number of court of appeals nominees      whom liberals oppose.       One can quibble about the names the senator left off his      list; he did not, for example, promise a hearing for D.C.      Circuit nominee John Roberts. But the overall message was      positive. If Mr. Leahy sticks to the plans he laid out, this      could be a fair and productive year for judicial nominations.       Mr. Leahy also asked that President Bush do more to      accommodate the concerns of Senate Democrats in making      nominations. It is a message that Mr. Bush should take to      heart. In two courts of appeals in particular, the 6th and      4th circuits, Republicans blocked President Clinton's      nominees for years, keeping seats open that Mr. Bush is now      keen to fill. Democratic senators from Michigan and North      Carolina want a say in who gets nominated and are blocking      Mr. Bush's nominees. Mr. Bush has the right to name whomever      he wants, but the Democratic grievance is legitimate, and the      process would benefit greatly if these logjams could be      broken in a fashion acceptable to both parties. It's hard to      imagine that nowhere in these two states are there potential      judicial candidates whose records and qualifications stand      above politics.
