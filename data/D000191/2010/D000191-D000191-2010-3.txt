  Mr. DeFAZIO. Yesterday, with one vote, the United States Senate increased the debt of the United States by $858 billion. Is this the best we can do to help those out of work, the best we can do to begin a sustained economic recovery, to enshrine the trickle-down, supply-side tax cuts of the Bush years that have failed so miserably over the last decade and some of the worst aspects of the so-called stimulus debt finance consumption of goods made in China with money borrowed from China?  Worse yet, $112 billion of this is going to come from Social Security, the first time Congress has ever broken down the firewall between the general fund of the United States and the sacrosanct Social Security trust fund.  No, we could do much, much better.                          ____________________
