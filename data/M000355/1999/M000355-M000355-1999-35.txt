 CRAIG. I am happy to yield.  Mr. McCONNELL. Most of the Republican Members of the Senate have been vigorous supporters of tort reform, changes in the legal system of this country. I ask my friend from Idaho, if the American Trial Lawyers Association gave $1 million to the Republican National Committee, would that turn the Republicans in the Senate into vigorous opponents of legal reform?
