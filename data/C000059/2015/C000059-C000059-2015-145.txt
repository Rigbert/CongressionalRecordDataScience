Chairman, I am happy to accept the gentleman's amendment.  The Department of the Interior tells me they are already in compliance with the executive order. There is no question that providing Indian tribes with access to their sacred sites is the right thing to do, so I would be more than happy to accept the gentleman's amendment.
