Speaker, reclaiming my time, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry).  Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, if I may close. I want to thank Congressmen Poliquin and Hudson, and the majority leader, Mr. McCarthy, for their kind comments. I just want to close with that.  Parker grew up in upstate New York but has done a fantastic job for the last 12 years working for the people of North Carolina's 10th District. She is a New Yorker but gets the South.  She is a Republican who has friends across the aisle. She is a Republican through and through and committed to our party, our ideology, and the work that we are trying to achieve. While she could be a partisan in her role here counting votes for Republicans, she never lost sight of those relationships across the aisle that could make this place work.  While I will miss her counsel on a daily basis, while I will miss her words of encouragement and also the tough words when you need them, when Members need them--and I have certainly needed them over the last decade--I am grateful for her service. I am grateful for what she has done for this institution, for me, and for the countless staff that she has mentored along the way. I wish her well.  I say to her two daughters watching that they have a fantastic example in their mother. While she may be tough with us at work, I know she cares about them and loves them dearly.  The life that Parker and Todd have built together is a great example of a loving family, while also both being professionals who have quite challenging careers.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the indulgence of my colleagues and the kind comments for Parker, and I encourage folks to wish her well in her new endeavors.                              {time}  1645
