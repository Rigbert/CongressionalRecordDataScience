Speaker, I rise today to honor my constituent and the National President of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, Jan Withers, who this December will complete a three and a half year term as President of MADD, the Nation's leading voice against drunk driving.  Ms. Withers joined MADD in 1992, after her 15-year-old daughter, Alisa Joy, was killed by an underage drinker who chose to drive after consuming numerous alcoholic beverages. She first volunteered by sharing her story and lobbying for tougher legislation to help stop this preventable violent crime. In Maryland and across the country, Withers actively campaigned to lower the legal limit of blood alcohol content for drivers from 0.10 BAC to 0.08 BAC, and had the privilege to be present in the Oval Office when President Clinton signed that change into law in 2000.  With all of the work she has done at the State and national level, her passion remains providing support for other victims and survivors of this violent crime. Before becoming National President in July 2011, Ms. Withers served as a victim's advocate for MADD Maryland, facilitating a support group for victims and participating in the MADD Maryland Operations Council. She joined the MADD National Board of Directors in 2005 and has served on numerous committees, including Communications and Branding, Public Policy, and Victim Services.  During her tenure as National President, Ms. Withers has traveled the country and walked the halls of Congress speaking to lawmakers about MADD's Campaign to Eliminate Drunk Driving, supporting the survivors of this violent crime, and preventing underage drinking. In large part because of her efforts, the recent highway reauthorization bill fully codified MADD's campaign by funding DUI crackdowns, creating an ignition interlock incentive grant program, and authorizing the Driver Alcohol Detection System for Safety--or DADSS program. We are all hopeful that these three initiatives will lead to a reduction and the eventual elimination of drunk driving in America.  Thanks to the tireless efforts of Ms. Withers, thousands of lives have been saved and countless victims of this crime assisted. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the service of MADD National President Jan Withers.                          ____________________
