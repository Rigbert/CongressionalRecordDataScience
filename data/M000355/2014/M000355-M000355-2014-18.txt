 President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Kentucky Communities Economic Opportunity Council, KCEOC, Community Action Partnership--an organization that for the past 50 years has been dedicated to the cause of destroying the roots of poverty in Southeastern Kentucky.  KCEOC was one of the first community action agency organizations in the country to be established to target the causes of poverty on the State and local level. Founded in 1964, it can now celebrate five decades serving its community.  Based out of Knox County, KY, KCEOC helps over 7,000 Kentuckians achieve financial stability every year through a number of antipoverty programs. This includes Head Start and Early Head Start, programs that aim to build children's educational foundation from an early age. KCEOC is also involved in job training and career planning, providing affordable housing, and food and clothing drives.  The KCEOC Community Action Partnership recognizes that a ``hand up'' is more effective than a ``hand out.'' They are dedicated to providing Kentuckians mired in poverty with the means and assistance necessary to break the chain of poverty that has afflicted too many Southeastern Kentuckians for generations.  Although there are many more programs instituted by KCEOC that covera diverse range of problems--including an IRS Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program, a Summer Food Service Program, and a KCEOC Aquatic Club--at their core they are all designed to impact the people of the community in a positive way. This is an objective that the organization continues to achieve, year after year.  When one Kentuckian who benefitted from KCEOC's services was asked what mattered to him the most, he replied:       Getting my education. I had never planned on getting my GED      or going to college. [The staff at KCEOC] really pushed me      and encouraged me.  I especially want to thank the leadership of KCEOC, including its president/CEO, Mr. Paul D. Dole, who was honored in 2013 as one of the region's top entrepreneurs in Southern and Eastern Kentucky at the 2013 Excellence in Entrepreneurship event, hosted by the Center for Rural Development in Somerset.  For their 50 years of serving the community of Southeastern Kentucky, I ask that my Senate colleagues join me in honoring KCEOC. May their next 50 years be as beneficial to the Commonwealth of Kentucky as their first.                          ____________________
