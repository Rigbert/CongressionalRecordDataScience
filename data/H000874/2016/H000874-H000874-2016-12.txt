Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California and return that wish for a Merry Christmas. This is not our last week. We are going to be here next week, so maybe we will save that for then.  I do look forward and the people look forward. This election has been a deeply troubling one for all sides in many respects. I think it is our responsibility to try to bring some degree of confidence to all of our constituents, whatever they believe, whoever they voted for, that we are going to move forward in a constructive, positive way to make America an even greater country than it is now.  I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________
