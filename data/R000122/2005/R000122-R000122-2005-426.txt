President, I join several of my colleagues in introducing the Better Healthcare Through Information Technology Act. This bill represents a strong step forward in modernizing our health care system and paving the way to greater efficiency and quality in the delivery of care.  Health care costs are becoming an enormous drain on employers, employees, and the Nation as a whole. More Americans are uninsured, and premiums for health insurance are increasing at an unsustainable rate of 20, 30, and even 40 percent per year. Health care reform is needed to address the huge concerns of the American people and our Nation's businesses. Indeed, the fact that companies like GM are losing competitiveness and laying off 25,000 workers, in part due to health costs, is a strong sign that our current health care system is flawed.  Solving these challenges will require new, bold policy initiatives to make health care coverage more affordable for employers, employees, and all Americans. Comprehensive efforts at change must be considered in our approach to health care reform. As a start, there are numerous improvements that can--and should--be made to fully pull the industry into the information age with the widespread adoption of information technology. It is unfortunate, but not surprising, that many of our Nation's other systems, such as our banking systems, are decades ahead in providing a seamless national network facilitating nearly instantaneous and universal access to information. It is high time for this body to act to modernize our health system as well, for its adoption of IT systems has the promise to improve quality while simultaneously reducing cost.  There are significant barriers to the adoption of IT by health care providers, including often-prohibitive costs of capital expenditures needed for hardware and software and a lack of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information. Systems are prohibitively expensive for many physician practices and there is no guarantee of interoperability with the system used at a local hospital, lab, or pharmacy.  The Better Healthcare Through Information Technology Act addresses many of these barriers. It codifies existing efforts by the government to spur the use of health IT. It creates a public-private collaborative to build consensus on a single set of standards. To ensure that these standards will then be embraced, our bill requires Federal procurement of information technology, and data collection by Federal agencies to comply with them.  A similar collaborative on a local scale already exists in Rhode Island. The Rhode Island Quality Institute links providers, hospitals, insurers, government, businesses, and the academic community in the pursuit of improving health care quality. I commend the Rhode Island Quality Institute for its statewide efforts to make Rhode Island a true health care improvement ``learning lab,'' and I believe that the bill we are introducing today will support these and similar efforts around the country.  To do this, our legislation recognizes and aims to address the financing challenges faced by providers. The bill establishes a number of competitive grants and facilitates State loan programs that are designed to get qualified health IT systems in the hands of doctors, hospitals, and clinics. Other provisions, including modifications to Federal anti-kickback and Stark laws and the establishment of a toll-free telephone number or Web site to assist physicians, will accelerate the implementation and integration of health IT.  The combination of uniform standards, help for physicians to purchase health IT systems, and improved exchange of electronic information through a national system will ultimately move us toward a conversion to Electronic Medical Records. Records will seamlessly follow the patient and improve evidence-based medicine by allowing aggregate data to be used in the determination of best treatment practices. Decision support systems will provide doctors with the most up-to-date evidence-based recommendations available.  Perhaps most importantly, though, the use of IT offers the hope of reducing the thousands of medical errors each year that add to both unnecessary pain and suffering and the cost of health care. Computerized Physician Order Entry, or CPOE, could alone bring enormous savings to the health care system by reducing medication errors in hospitals and clinics.  Systemic errors such as these account for many of the medical errors identified by the Institute of Medicine in their seminal study on this topic that estimated up to 98,000 avoidable deaths from medical errors each year. It will take government action and investment to bring about the technological sophistication and interoperability necessary to substantially reduce the incidence of these errors.  I want to thank Senators Enzi, Kennedy, Dodd, and others for their efforts on this bill. I look forward to continuing to work with each of them and the rest of my colleagues to bring our Nation's health system into the 21st century.                                 ______                                       By
