Mr. Speaker, I rise to introduce a bill to restore 100 percent deductibility for meals which seafood processing companies are compelled to provide to their employees at processing operations located in remote areas of Alaska. This legislation is necessary because the limitations on the deductibility of business meals and entertainment enacted in 1986 and 1993 have inadvertently reduced the deductibility of these employer provided meals to only 50 percent. The consequence has been that these companies, most of which are small businesses, are forced to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in additional taxes simply because they must provide meals to their employees at remote locales where there are no other meal options.  This legislation would conform the treatment of seafood processors under the Internal Revenue Code with the treatment of other employers--such as operators of commercial vessels and oil and gas rigs--who must provide meals to their employees because the employees do not have another practical alternative to obtaining their meals. Under current law, these employers, because they must provide meals to their employees, are permitted to deduct the full cost of such meals as an ordinary and necessary business expense. The bill I am introducing would provide the same treatment for seafood processors in Alaska.  The seafood processing industry in Alaska is primarily located in remote coastal areas of the State, almost all along the Aleutian chain of islands. Most of these facilities operate on a seasonal basis from spring through fall, and must fly their workers in for temporary periods. The processing plants are located near very small towns and native villages. In some cases the processing plant is the only human activity in the area. Because of this isolation and lack of infrastructure the firms which operate in the areas have no choice but to provide all meals consumed by their employees. In fact, these operations are so isolated that the employers must also provide all housing, recreation, transportation and medical services.  There would be only about 40 firms which fall into the category covered by our legislation. Most employ under 100 people, although some are larger operations with hundreds of workers. But in all cases it must be emphasized that the employer is the only source of food and shelter for the employees and that the plants are located in very remote areas. In many cases there are no other settlements, and, indeed, no other human activity for many miles around. A final significant impact of the industry on our Nation comes from its role as a source of export revenue. Over 50 percent of the export earnings generated by the seafood industry nationwide originates in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. After years of suffering from huge trade deficits it is encouraging to see that our region of the country is making a positive contribution to our balance of payments.  The changes to the tax laws in 1986 and 1993 which reduced the deductibility of business meal and entertainment expenses from 100 percent to 80 percent and then to 50 percent were justified as an appropriate limitation on a discretionary business expense with a significant personal consumption element. The decision was made that good public policy required changing the tax code so that the public was no longer helping defray the cost for business organizations to entertain clients and other business associates.  However, Congress recognized that where the employer must as a practical or legal matter provide meals to employees--that it, where the employees do not really have the option of providing meals for themselves--that such a mandatory cost of business should continue to be fully deductible to the business. Under current law, employers of crew members on certain commercial vessels and employers of certain oil and gas workers, who provide meals to their employees when those employees have no real alternative means of obtaining food are permitted to deduct the full cost of providing the meals. The same precise situation applies to seafood processors in Alaska and they should be governed by the same rule. Their workers cannot go to a restaurant, they cannot go home and they cannot bring meals with them to work since they live in bunkhouses and do not have access to grocery stores.  The companies which are covered by this amendment have paid the Federal treasury millions of dollars in taxes since 1986. These tax payments are both unintended and unfair. In attempting to correct the abuse of the three martini lunch Congress certainly did not intend to burden legitimate businesses which are providing meals to their employees in cases where those employees have no other source of food.                          ____________________
