 President, the resolution before the Senate honors the sacrifice of the members of our Armed Forces who have given their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is fitting that we honor their service and their sacrifice.  The resolution states that sacrifices of the fallen are in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force and Coast Guard. These selfless Americans have upheld the fine traditions of those who fought at Guadalcanal, Inchon, in Vietnam, Korea, Gettysburg, and Trenton.  We have lost 69 brave volunteers from Kentucky. They are not forgotten by their families, they are not forgotten by the U.S. Senate, and they are not forgotten by those who carry on the fight.
