President, I wanted to come and talk about the Democratic bill called the Consumer-First Energy Act. We go through the same things over and over. We have an energy bill that has no energy in it. I said this on the floor last December. We keep talking about energy, and every time we try to expand energy, try to expand the supply, it dies right down party lines.
