 The Senator is quite right. Our aid program to Lebanon is structured so that all assistance is channeled through grants or contracts to American non-governmental organizations or U.S. firms. The American educational institutions there should be the first to be supported. Education is at the heart of what we are trying to accomplish with our aid program. It instills the fundamental values that will guide the next generation of leaders. It will determine whether those leaders share our commitment to democracy and free market principles, and whether they learn how to solve their own problems or remain dependent on us. An investment in American education will pay greater dividends than anything else we can do in Lebanon.
