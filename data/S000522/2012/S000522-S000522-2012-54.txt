Mr. Speaker, Dr. Michael Ochs has announced his retirement from the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, also known as the Helsinki Commission, which I chair. So at this time I'd like to pay tribute to him for his 25 years of service to the Commission. Michael began his work as a member of the professional staff on October 1, 1987, a time when the changes to come in what was then the Soviet Union were unimaginable. Yet within a few years, the Soviet Union had disintegrated, succeeded by newly independent states facing difficult and sometimes complex transition periods.  Dr. Ochs joined the staff of the Commission after completing his doctoral work in Russian history, and began his career by monitoring human rights abuses in the Soviet Union. He participated in the first international human rights conference to be convened in the Soviet Union, a meeting eventually interrupted by the KGB.  Following the breakup of the Soviet Union, Michael was an early voice promoting democracy, human rights, and the rule of law in post-Soviet states, particularly in the Caucasus and Central Asia. In the early 1990s, he traveled regularly to the region, working with authorities, opposition representatives, journalists and human rights activists to promote democracy and human rights, as well as participating in early OSCE election observation missions. This early involvement in the newly independent states gave Michael a remarkable depth of understanding of the region. His extensive network of contacts has made him indispensable to the Commission as well as other U.S. government agencies. He is certainly one of our government's top experts on the Caucasus and Central Asia.  Michael's extraordinary expertise has served the Commission well over the years, and has also been recognized and called on by other U.S. government agencies. He has earned a reputation for his thoughtful and thorough analytical skills, which are respected not only within the U.S. government, but also within the region by both opposition and authorities alike. He also is known for his outstanding language skills, including near-native proficiency in Russian, as well as a command of Polish, Azeri and several other languages.  Michael's tenure at the Commission has seen color revolutions in Ukraine, Georgia, and Kyrgyzstan, tragic massacres and violence in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, and steps forward towards democracy throughout the region, and, sadly, many steps backward in the region. He has worked hard to advocate for activists, journalists, and others arrested for opposing authoritarian regimes--and, sometimes against the odds--has been successful in getting individuals released from prison.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to recognize and commend Dr. Michael Ochs for his faithful service to the Commission and in defense of human rights and freedom. As he will be retiring at the end of this month, this is also a sad good-bye for me--I have known Michael almost since he joined the Commission, have traveled abroad with him, benefited greatly from his expertise, enjoyed his company immensely, and will certainly miss him.                          ____________________
