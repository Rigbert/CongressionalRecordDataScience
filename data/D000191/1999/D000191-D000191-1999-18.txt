  Mr. DeFAZIO. ``Do no harm'' is a tenet that underlies the practice of medicine in America. But despite the system we have, the great system for training, licensure, the safeguards that are built in, occasionally someone incompetent, or in this case a group of people totally unqualified in the practice of medicine, does harm to an individual patient or a group of patients.  Today, the United States Congress wishes under the leadership of the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde) to irrevocably change end-of-life pain care in America. On the one hand the bill that will come up today says you can aggressively treat pain at the end of life even if it causes death, but the other section of the bill says if a death results in the aggressive management of pain, the Drug Enforcement Administration, that well-known bastion of medical lore, will determine the intent of the physician who provided that prescription after the fact. This is an extraordinary intrusion not only into States' rights but into the practice of medicine. Inserting the Drug Enforcement Administration into the patient-doctor relationship is outrageous and it will set back pain management for decades in this country.                          ____________________
