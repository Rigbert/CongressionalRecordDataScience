Senators should be seated at their desks for this historic vote. Following that vote, we will consider the nomination of Ben Bernanke to be Chairman of the Federal Reserve under a time agreement reached last week. Tomorrow evening we will proceed as a body to the House Chamber to hear the President's State of the Union Message, which is due to be delivered at 9 o'clock eastern standard time.                          ____________________
