 President, unfortunately, he has left the floor, but I just wanted to thank the distinguished Senator from Texas for his brilliant speech outlining the deficiencies of the bill, which will pass later today. I am extraordinarily grateful for his overly generous comments about my work on this issue. I assure him that the vote today is not the end. There is litigation ahead. We will have announcements about the litigation team in the near future. I share the hope of the Senator from Texas that the unfortunate parts of this bill, which he outlined so skillfully, will indeed be struck down in the courts. I can assure him that we are going to give it our best shot and that we will have an extraordinarily talented legal team spanning the illogical divide in this country to take this case forward and to give it our very best effort and to protect the first amendment, which he outlined so skillfully in his comments.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
