I thank my good friend for yielding. And I deeply appreciate both Chairman Sensenbrenner's and Chairman Chabot's courageous leadership on this human right issue.  Mr. Speaker, slowly, but inexorably, the movement to reinfranchise unborn children in law as respected and cherished members of the human family is growing.  The most recent issue of Newsweek, it is a cover story entitled, ``Should a Fetus Have Rights; How Science Is Changing the Debate,'' absolutely shatters the myth that unborn children are somehow less human and less alive than their born brothers and sisters.  Indeed, a second Newsweek story also in this week's edition, ``Treating the Tiniest Patients,'' notes that ``medicine has already granted unborn babies a unique form of personhood, as patients.''  Newsweek points out that, ``Once just grainy blobs on a TV monitor, new high-tech fetal ultrasound images allow prospective parents to see tiny fingers and toes, arms and legs, and a beating heart as early as 12 weeks. While these images make a parent's heart leap for joy, they also pack such an emotional punch that even the most hard-line abortions rights supporters may find themselves questioning their beliefs.''  Mr. Speaker, let us hope so. May the questioning begin. We have lived in denial concerning the violence of abortion for far too long. We have, by our actions, or more so by our inaction, enabled and empowered abortionists to dismember, decapitate and chemically poison more than 43 million innocent and precious babies since 1973.  Today, Mr. Speaker, we can stop some of this violence against children. Today we can take one of those weapons out of the hands of the abortionist. Today we can tell America that partially delivering a baby, only to stab that child in the skull so that his or her brains can be sucked out, is the nightmarish world of a Hannibal Lecter, not American medicine or jurisprudence.
