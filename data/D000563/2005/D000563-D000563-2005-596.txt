We faced 9/11, that terrible day in our history when 3,000 Americans lost their lives. I would like to ask the Senator from Louisiana, if I am not mistaken, didn't we say we were going to come in and help those families who may have been in the same circumstance, where their place of employment just exploded and disappeared? Also, I would ask the Senator from Louisiana, when we had an earthquake in California, in Northridge, didn't we step in and say we are going to provide housing vouchers to people displaced because of earthquakes?  I ask this of the Senator because I don't quite understand this double standard. Why, if the worst natural disaster in modern memory occurred a few weeks ago, are we in the midst of debating the most basic things people need in crisis: health care, housing, cash so they can buy the basic necessities of life? Why are we facing this double standard, when America's heart was broken by the scenes we saw day after day and night after night on the television screen, coming from your hometown, your neighbors and their suffering?
