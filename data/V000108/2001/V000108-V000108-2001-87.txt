Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to honor two dedicated citizens of Indiana's First Congressional District on the occasion of their retirement from the Inland Steel Company of East Chicago, Indiana. Jesus ``Jesse'' Salvador Vargas and Robert ``Bobby'' A. Hill, both longtime members of Local Union 1010 of the United Steelworkers of America, will be honored at a Retirement Party to be held on Friday, September 21, 2001 at American Legion Post 369 in East Chicago.  A native of Monterrey, Mexico, Jesse Vargas has been employed in the Transportation Department at Inland Steel since 1965. During that time, Mr. Vargas has been extremely active in Local Union 1010. He has held many appointed positions, including serving on both the Sports and Community Service committees. Mr. Vargas has also been elected Safety Man for the Transportation Department, and has been selected to represent Local 1010 at many United Steelworkers of America International Conventions. Throughout his career, he has shown his dedication to his Union Brothers and Sisters by traveling across the nation to assist them in strikes, lockouts, and organizing drives. Now retiring with his wife, Rubia, after a 36-year career, Mr. Vargas serves as an outstanding example of the dedicated Union craftsmen and laborers that built our nation.  Bobby Hill, an employee of Inland Steel and member of Local Union 1010 for 43 years, has provided exemplary service and leadership to both his employer and his union. Hailing from Haysi, Virginia, Mr. Hill grew up the youngest of nine children. Since 1958, he worked as a Switchman, Conductor, and Engineer at the Indiana Harbor Works. Mr. Hill has also served diligently in numerous elected positions at Local 1010, including Safety Steward for the Transportation Department, Guide, Trustee, and Head Trustee. As a member of the Community Service committee, Mr. Hill volunteered his services across the Calumet Region. Like Jesse Vargas, Mr. Hill traveled across the country to assist his brethren in strikes, lockouts, and organizing drives. Bobby Hill will be greatly missed by his colleagues at Inland Steel and Local 1010 as he retires with his wife, Mary Ann.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my colleagues join with me today in thanking these two men for their lifetime of service, and in wishing them well in their retirement. Bobby Hill and Jesse Vargas have given many hours of their precious time in service of their Union brethren. The sacrifices made by dedicated workers like Mr. Hill and Mr. Vargas have made American labor the safest, most efficient, and most quality-driven labor force in the world. I wish them both a long, healthy, and happy retirement.                          ____________________
