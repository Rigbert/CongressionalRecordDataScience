Speaker, on March 26, 2004, Bowie Lodge Number 2309 of the Benevolent and Protective Order of the Elks will welcome Amos A. McCallum of Saco, Maine, Grand Exalted Ruler of the Grand Lodge of Elks to Maryland at a luncheon to be held at the Bowie Lodge on March 26, 2004.  My long-time friend Judge Gerard F. Devlin will serve as the Master of Ceremonies and I regret that my duties here in this House will not permit me to attend and join with my many friends in the Bowie Elks in welcoming this distinguished guest to our State. Initiated in the Biddleford-Saco lodge in 1963, Grand Exalted Ruler McCallum rose through the chairs in his native Maine to eventually hold the high office he now occupies with such distinction.  Space would not permit me to list all of the many charitable philanthropic activities individual lodges and the Grand Lodge participate in, but suffice it to say that no fraternal organization does more for people than the Benevolent and Protective Order of the Elks.  I salute the Grand Exalted Ruler Amos A. McCallum and hope he enjoys typical Maryland hospitality in his visit to our State.                          ____________________
