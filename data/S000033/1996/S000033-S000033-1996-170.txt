 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by Kara von Behren, Sara Reeve, Anna Laszewski, and Alison Gingras, students from Peoples Academy in Vermont. They were speaking at myrecent town meeting on issues facing young people.       The environment needs a place in the modern high school      curriculum. Without knowledge of the problems that fact us,      we cannot reverse their ill effect.       We're going to start off with a demonstration. Could you      all stand up, please? Thanks. All right, we're going to start      off with a couple of questions, and if your answer is ``no,''      could you please sit back down.       Okay, our first question is: do you recycle at home?       Our second question is: do you compost at home?       Do you turn off the water when you brush your teeth?       Do you reuse your lunch bags or bring a cloth one?       Does your family buy recycled products?       All right, congratulations to any of you who are still      standing (one or two)--you actually have some part in      preserving our environment, and helping us to make this world      a better place.       As an American Literature class, we compiled a survey,      trying to find out how educated our high school was about the      environment. We surveyed students in grades 9 through 12, as      well as the faculty members. The questions ranged from,      ``what does EPA stand for?'' to ``how long are your      showers?'' to ``how do you feel about the future of our      world?'' We discovered that many students didn't know much      about environmental action programs--they didn't know the      budget cuts would completely eliminate them. Students and      teachers both felt that more time should be spent in the      classroom discussing environmental issues, and that a      definite part of the curriculum should be dedicated to it.      It's not an issue only for science classes; it can be brought      into every major course of study.       For example, we took a normal letter-writing assignment and      transformed it into an environmental letter-writing campaign.      We wrote letters to our Congressional delegation in      Washington about budget cuts and other environmental issues.      This is only one of the ways in which we've incorporated      environmental education into our classroom, without      completely altering the basic curriculum. And we have these      letters, and later on we'd like to give them to you,      Congressman.       Congressman Sander. That was a very creative and      interesting testimony. I think the essence of what you're      saying is that if people think in an environmentally      conscious way, we can have a profound impact on the      environment. In a broader sense, what would you describe as      the major environmental crisis our planet faces?       Answer. We've concentrated mostly on the budget cuts      planned in the environmental action programs such as the EPA.      The drastic cuts would completely eliminate clean water acts,      safe drinking water, the state revolving funds that allow      cities and counties to create protective water systems, such      as sewer treatment plants. . . . Our second presentation will      cover more of that.                          ____________________
