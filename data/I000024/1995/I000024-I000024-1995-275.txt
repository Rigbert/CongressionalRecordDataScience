We served together for 8 years in the House of Representatives, and she was there before that. And I am sure what was going on before. But we tried again and again to do it from a statutory perspective, and it did not work.  I am a little embarrassed to say that it was one of the Members of the House from the State of Oklahoma that challenged in the courts the Gramm-Rudman approach to balancing the budget, which was an excellent approach. It was ingenious. However, apparently it did cause the administration to infringe upon legislative powers and there was some constitutional problem with it.  But those same people who took that to court and were able to strike it down so that we did not have to comply with the targets are the ones who say we do not want a balanced budget amendment in the Constitution because that is our job to do it. I say yes. I agree in this case with those who object to it. It is our job to do it. But we have clearly demonstrated for 40 years that we are incapable of resisting the insatiable appetite to spend the money that we generate from future generations.
