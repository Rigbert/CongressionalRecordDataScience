 President, I would like to highlight several provisions I worked to secure in the water resources bill that will be a great benefit to Kentucky and to my constituents. Included in the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act is a provision I have worked on with Paducah Mayor Gayle Kaler, Paducah city manager Jeff Pederson, and Paducah city engineer Rick Murphy that will advance a critical and comprehensive flood wall infrastructure project to better protect residents and businesses in Paducah from flooding.  The bill also includes an important provision that directs the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to transfer certain inoperable lock and dam infrastructure along the Green and Barren Rivers in Kentucky to State and local entities. My Green and Barren Rivers provision will allow communities to remove certain aging infrastructure in an effort to enhance river-based recreation and tourism. This language also allows the Rochester Dam Regional Water Commission to take control of the Rochester Dam--a critical water source for citizens and employers in six counties--so the dam can be repaired and better maintained. In this effort, I would like to thank David Phemister and Mike Hensley with the Kentucky Nature Conservancy, as well as members and supporters of the Rochester Dam Regional Water Commission, including Butler County Judge Executive David Fields, Walt Beasley with the Ohio County Water District, Damon Talley, and Gary Larimore with the Kentucky Rural Water Association.                          ____________________
