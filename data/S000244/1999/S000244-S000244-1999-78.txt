Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, I share the concern of the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren) about the activities of the Committee on Appropriations relative to the NASA budget. And it was my hope that at least some of these funds can be added to the Committee on Appropriations mark between now and the time the VA-HUD bill comes to the floor.  Let me state, however, that passage of the VA-HUD bill is necessary even at the lower amount if we are to avoid having a government shutdown of NASA as well as HUD and VA departments at the end of September. That I think is the worst of all possible alternatives.  So we have to work together in a bipartisan basis to attempt to get a VA-HUD bill out of this House and over to the other body for its consideration as we continue working on giving NASA an appropriate appropriation.  I would like to point out to the gentlewoman from California, however, that the mark that came out of the Committee on Appropriations for fiscal year 2000 is $700 million higher than the outyear budget that was submitted in January of 1996 by the Clinton administration. In other words, the Clinton administration's projections for the NASA budget for fiscal year 2000 was $700 million lower than the Committee on Appropriations mark which has been so roundly criticized.  So I think that we ought to quit playing games with numbers, I hate to use these numbers to counter the numbers of the gentlewoman from California, and get on to the business of making sure that NASA has the funds to do its job.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
