 President, today we have the opportunity to finish a very long journey in the quest to build a dynamic, comprehensive energy policy for the United States of America. I can say with pride that this Congress, through many trials and tribulations has now performed admirably in its duty to the American people. This is a balanced energy bill that focuses as much on the future as it does the present. We have the opportunity with the passage of this legislation to safely produce more energy from more sources and with more infrastructure security then ever before.  Among the many people whose hard work has made the difference, I must first thank the chairmen and ranking members of all the appropriating committees that have been involved in this process.  Credit must also go to all members of my staff, who spent many hours sifting through the nuts and bolts of this bill. Kolan Davis, Mark Prater, Elizabeth Paris, Christy Mistr, Kurt Kovarik, John Good, and Nick Wyatt showed great dedication to the tasks before them.  As is usually the case, the cooperation of Senator Baucus and his staff was imperative. I particularly want to thank Russ Sullivan, Patrick Heck, Bill Dauster, Kathy Ruffalo-Farnsworth, Matt Jones, and Ryan Abraham.  I also want to mention George K. Yin, the chief of staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation and his staff, especially the fuel fraud and energy team of Tom Barthold, John Navratil, Deirdre James, Roger Colinvaux, Allen Littman, Gray Fontenot, and Gary Bornholdt as well as the always invaluable assistance of Mark Mathiesen, Jim Fransen and Mark McGunagle of Senate legislative counsel.  This conference agreement is infused with the spirit of bipartisan and bicameral cooperation. It is my commitment that spirit will be influential to the entire ongoing legislative process.
