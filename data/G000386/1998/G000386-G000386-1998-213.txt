 President, I rise today to introduce the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 1998. My Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts has jurisdiction over this matter, and I am very pleased that the ranking member of the subcommittee, Senator Durbin, has joined me in sponsoring this bill. It will require every Federal district court in the country to institute an alternative dispute resolution, or ADR, program. The bill will provide parties and district court judges with options other than the traditional, costly and adversarial process of litigation.  ADR programs have been gaining in popularity and respect for years now. For example, many contracts drafted today--between private parties, corporations, and even nations--include arbitration clauses. Most State and Federal bar associations, including the ABA, have established committees to focus on ADR. Also, comprehensive ADR programs are flourishing in many of the States.  ADR is also being used at the Federal level. In 1990, for example, President Bush signed into law a bill that I introduced called the Administrative Dispute Resolutions Act. The law promoted the increased use of ADR in Federal agency proceedings. In 1996, because ADR was working so well, we permanently re-authorized the law. And earlier this year, the executive branch recommitted themselves to using ADR as much as possible.  Since the late 1970s, our Federal district courts have also been successfully introducing ADR. In 1998, we authorized 20 district courts to begin implementing ADR programs. The results were very encouraging, so last year we made these programs permanent. It's time to take another step and make ADR available in all district courts.  Mr. President, ADR allows innovations and flexibility in the administration of justice. The complex legal problems that people have demand creative and flexible solutions on the part of the courts. There are numerous benefits to providing people with alternatives to traditional litigation. For example, a recent Northwestern University study of ADR programs in State courts indicated that mediation significantly reduced the duration of lawsuits and produced significant cost savings for litigants. That means fewer cases on the docket and decreased costs. The Federal courts should be taking every opportunity to reap the benefits that the state courts have been enjoying.  Mr. President, the fact of the matter is that ADR works. The future of justice in this country includes ADR. Perhaps one of the signs of this is that many of the best law, business, and graduate schools in the country are beginning to emphasize training in negotiation, mediation, and other kinds of dispute resolution.  Quite simply, this bill will increase the availability of ADR in our Federal courts. It mandates that every district court establish some form of professional ADR program. It provides the district, however, with the flexibility to decide what kind of ADR works best locally. The bill also allows a district with a current ADR program that's working well to continue the program.  This bill is the Senate companion to H.R. 3528, which was reported out of the Judiciary Committee today without any opposition. Our bill tracks the original House bill, except for some findings and a few technical changes to improve the legislation. These changes were included in the bill reported out of committee. The House bill received overwhelming, bipartisan support, passing 405-2.  The Department of Justice, along with the administration, the Administrative Office of the Courts, and the American Bar Association, including its business section, all support the legislation with these improvements. The consensus is clear: ADR has an important role to play in our Federal court system.  Mr. President, this bill is a step in the right direction for the administration of justice in our country. Increased availability of ADR will benefit all of us. It should be an option to people in every judicial district of the country. This bill assures that it will be.                                 ______                                       By
