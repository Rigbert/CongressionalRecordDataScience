 President, just a brief observation about the vote we just had. I would say to our colleague from Kentucky, Senator Paul, the issue of the American effort in Libya is a legitimate discussion for debate, I think a legitimate issue for debate. That is a debate we need to have, and I will be talking to the majority leader about the appropriate time to do that.  A number of Senators are talking among themselves on a bipartisan basis about what kind of resolution would be appropriate, and certainly the Senate speaking on this issue is something we need to do in the very near future.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
