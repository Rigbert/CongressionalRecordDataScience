President, I believe the Senator from North Dakota is next. Senators certainly on this side of the aisle have been very good in coming forward to talk about amendments, technical points they may want to have cleared. I appreciate that. I hope if anybody else does they would let us know as soon as possible because this is moving very quickly, and at some point it is going to be wrapped up.
