In 1992 we had a Republican President and a Democratic Senate; we confirmed 11 appellate court judges and 55 district court judges. Four years later you have a Democratic President and a Republican Senate and look at the vast difference: zero appellate court judges and only 17 district court judges, notwithstanding an enormous vacancy rate.  I think what it shows is that, if you want something to demonstrate partisanship, when the Democrats controlled the Senate with a Republican President, they still cooperated to give that Republican President a significant number of judges in the second session, in a Presidential election year, the time it normally slows down, as contrasted to the absolute opposite, the unprecedented opposite, of what happened when you have a Democratic President and a Republican Senate.
