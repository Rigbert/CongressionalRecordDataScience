Mr. Chairman, on behalf of the majority, I want to thank the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Cannon) for offering this very, very important amendment. It will ensure that the U.N. is not using its funds to inadvertently fund terrorism or fraudulent companies. It is a very good amendment, and we accept it and support it.
