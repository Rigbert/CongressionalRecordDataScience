  Recently the Obama administration has been talking a lot about income inequality and poverty. Yesterday I spoke about the issue, about the war on poverty, its successes and its failures. As I said yesterday, the United States has spent trillions of dollars in the last 50 years fighting the so-called war on poverty. I said yesterday that the results have been marginal, in some cases successful, reducing the poverty rate from 19 percent down to the 15 percent it is now. But a lot more needs to be done.  Now, in the fight against the war on poverty, this administration, like a lot of administrations, wants to spend more money on more programs. Some of that may be justified, but that does not seem to fix the problems. If you just hand this money out with no strings and no oversight, it gets diverted and misused. That is the purpose of my speaking today on the subject of public housing.  Wasted money does not help the poor. There are a lot of people who make a nice profit from the poverty of others. This administration has been helping a number of these profiteers while the poor suffer. I want to be clear as to some of these issues I am talking about--their genesis goes back to previous administrations as well. Through my oversight work, I have seen this happen over and over, that a few people profit from trying to help the poor, but the money does not go there. The Department of Housing and Urban Development hands out $4 billion in Federal money every year to local housing authorities. This money is supposed to help provide clean, affordable, safe housing for the poor. But, while no one is watching, much of the money gets spent on high salaries and perks for the people who run the housing authorities. These housing authorities have other sources of money. For most of them, up to 90 percent of their total funding comes from the $4 billion contributed by the Federal taxpayers.  Housing and Urban Development argues that because housing authorities are State and local government entities, there is no reason to scrutinize them from here in Washington, DC. As far as I am concerned, HUD is missing the point for 4 billion reasons. Those are dollar reasons. Taxpayer money should come with Federal oversight. We need to make sure that the Federal authorities who disburse it make sure they oversee that it is spent in the legal way--to help the people who need the help.  I have been conducting oversight of the wasteful spending at housing authorities for almost 4 years. I have been urging the Obama administration to look at what is happening and to take action. But there is little if any interest in the oversight of these Federal dollars by the folks writing the checks here in Washington, DC. They just want to send the checks and pat themselves on the back. They do not want to talk about what actually happens to the money once it is disbursed.  Federal funds end up feathering the nests of local housing bureaucrats instead of housing the poor. I will show you how that is done. Here are some of the most egregious examples of how ineffective the Department of Housing and Urban Development has been at policing local housing authorities.  Bradenton, FL, is an area of the country which was hit extremely hard during the foreclosure crisis, but employees at Bradenton Housing Authority only have to work 4 days a week. They get 2 weeks off at Christmas, bonuses in June and December, and the option to cash out up to a month of sick leave twice per year. They get free use of a car purchased by the housing authority. After 15 years of employment, they get to keep the car when they leave or take $10,000 instead; it is their choice.  There are generous fringe benefits, but many housing authorities also provide very lucrative salaries. These salaries far exceed the salaries of Federal employees right here in Washington, DC, who hand out the taxpayers' money to the housing authorities. The biggest salary jackpot winner I have encountered so far is the Atlanta Housing Authority. At least 22 employees there earn between $150,000 and $303,000 per year. The Atlanta Housing Authority benefits from a special HUD designation called ``moving to work.'' That program exempts designated housing authorities from certain requirements, including salary justification. This is not just an isolated example. The executive director of the Raleigh, NC, housing authority receives about $280,000 in salary and benefits, plus up to 30 vacation days. He also accumulates comp time for any hours he works over 7\1/2\ hours per day. He has used over 20 days of comp time per year since 2009. Add that to his regular vacation time, and he is out of the officenearly 3 months per year. Nine months of work for $280,000 is an annualized salary of $375,000 per year. Very few taxpayer-funded jobs pay anything close to that amount.  So what is the justification for such high salaries, particularly considering the fact that they are supposed to provide safe, affordable housing for low-income people? After years of ignoring the issue, HUD finally capped Federal funding for executive salaries at $155,500 per employee. Of course, this was only after various local media and I exposed deep-rooted problems and pushed the Department of Housing and Urban Development to act. But now housing authority executives have turned to creative accounting tricks to get around that limit of $155,500 per employee. Since some of their money comes from other sources, the housing authorities simply claim that any salary over the Federal limit comes from one of those other sources, whereas the money from those other sources ought to be used to help low-income people have affordable, clean, and safe housing.  Because of my oversight letters on this subject, HUD recently notified the housing authorities that they must document the original source of the funding used to pay salaries over the Federal limit. That is good news, but there are still larger problems. The Department is still not making this salary data public in a reasonable timeframe. I will give an example. This administration refused to release the 2010 set of data for almost a year. I hope we do not have to wait a year to get the most recent data.  Like many of our Federal agencies, some housing authorities spend large amounts of money on travel for conferences and training. Some of that may be legitimate, but I am raising questions about the extent to which it is done and the amount of money that is consumed. Staff and board members often attend the same conferences throughout the United States year after year. They often attend multiple conferences in a single year. In addition to travel costs, housing authorities must pay a conference fee for each attendee they send, often ranging from $400 at the low end to $1,000 per employee at the higher end.  That money could easily be used to improve conditions and make needed repairs in public housing facilities. Instead, it is frittered away on conferences. In other words, forget the low-income people they are supposed to be helping and spend the money someplace else.  The Tampa Housing Authority has spent more than $860,000 since 2009 for staff and board members to attend various conferences, seminars, and training programs--$860,000 that could have been used to provide affordable housing for low-income people. Tampa also has been sending 20 or more employees per year to conferences sponsored by the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials. That alone costs more than $177,000 per year.  The Atlanta Housing Authority spent more than $480,000 since 2009 for the employees to attend conferences and training sessions. In fact, the housing authority paid over $68,000 in conference fees to a software company after giving them a multimillion-dollar contract for a new computer system.  I wonder--I don't know, but I think it is legitimate to question--if the housing authority executive director thought to ask for a discount. Many of the housing authorities with questionable spending don't limit the abuses to salaries or travel.  The Tampa Housing Authority purchased a new $7 million administrative office that includes nearly $3 million in renovations and upgrades. That could have helped hundreds, if not thousands, of poor people needing the housing. They are also paying nearly $800,000 in salary and benefits for a public relations department while at the same time paying an employee another $170,369 as a PR consultant.  Other housing authorities are also spending exorbitant amounts for outside consultants. Some of these consultants are former employees of the local housing authority.  In 2013, the Pittsburgh Housing Authority retained 10 law firms for a total of $3.5 million over 3 years. One law firm has been representing the housing authority during inquiries by the Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of Inspector General and the city controller.  Think about that. It is bad enough that taxpayers' money meant to help the poor is wasted, but when the taxpayer also pays the lawyers to defend the very organization from scrutiny about whether the taxpayers' money was wasted is even more outrageous. Of course, that adds insult to injury.  In Philadelphia, outside lawyers blocked the inspector general's office from assessing spending data for months, and that cost the taxpayers millions of dollars.  The Pittsburgh Housing Authority also paid an outside consulting firm $1.25 million in the year 2012. The vice president at the consulting company billed the housing authority $404,000 for 2,400 hours of work. That is 48 hours a week for a year. It is more than double the $168,000 salary of the housing authority executive director.  Harris County, TX, is one of the most egregious examples of out-of-control spending. In 2013, the HUD inspector general questioned the mismanagement of over $27 million in Federal funding for Harris County. The IG provided the following examples of fraud and abuse: over $1.7 million in excessive payroll expenses; $190,000 for statues and monuments; $66,000 for employees' shirts embossed with logos; $27,000 for trophies, plaques, and awards; $14,500 for a helicopter, a chartered bus, and golf cart rentals for a grand opening; and $18,000 for letters written by Abraham Lincoln.  I continue to send my oversight letters to the Senate appropriators and the Senate banking committee. These are the letters I received permission to put in the Record at the end of my statement.  The Senate appropriators and the Senate banking committee members have jurisdiction over the Department of Housing and Urban Development. They have the authority to do something about these abuses. My colleagues need to know the extent of the problems, and that I am ready to work with the Members of this body to address these issues.  Employment at public housing authorities should be about public service. That is why we have a program serving the needs of low-income people. It is supposed to be providing clean, safe, affordable housing for those in need, not helping bureaucrats live high on the hog on the taxpayers' dime.  As I said in my opening, this problem didn't start with this administration. There is a culture here that had to start back a long time ago. But now, bringing these problems to the attention of this administration, I hope it will take them seriously. If this administration is truly serious about income inequality--and not only using it for political purposes--it would stop shoveling taxpayers' money out the door with practically no oversight, no controls, no limits, and the waste of money I have just expressed. If President Obama is truly serious about income inequality, he would take the money high-income public housing authorities waste and give it to the benefit of low-income patrons of public housing to provide what the law is meant to provide these people: safe, affordable, healthy housing.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 2013.     Hon. Shaun Donovan,     Secretary, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development,          Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary Donovan: The Department of Housing and Urban      Development (HUD) awarded high performer status to the Harris      County Housing Authority (HCHA) ``for eight consecutive      years'' between 2004 and 2011. In the 2009 Consolidated On-     Site Review, the HUD field office director, Dan Rodriguez,      even stated that, HCHA ``practices are some of the best      throughout our region.'' Following revelations of possible      mismanagement in 2012, Mr. Rodriguez then told the Houston      Chronicle, ``We didn't expect that anything was actually      going on here of concern.'' He further stated, ``We in the      field office here have always had the privilege of having one      of the highest-performing housing authorities in the      country.''       On June 19, 2013, the HUD Office of Inspector General (OIG)      released an audit report raising concerns about HCHA      mismanagement of over $27 million in federal funding. In      addition to over $7 million spent on an unauthorized disaster      assessment and over $8 million for the now-defunct Patriots      on the Lake development, the OIG provided numerous examples      of fraud and abuse of taxpayer dollars. These include:       Over $1.7 million in excessive payroll expenses;       $190,000 for statues and monuments;       $66,000 for employee shirts embossed with HCHA logos;       $54,000 for apartment rental for housing consultants;       $24,000 for a book writing project about disaster housing;       $27,000 for trophies, plaques and awards;       $14,500 for helicopter, chartered bus and golf cart rentals      for a grand opening;       $18,000 for letters written by Abraham Lincoln; and       Over $150,000 in missing electronic equipment including      computers and electronic tablets.       The OIG found that both HCHA management and the Board      failed to fulfill their oversight responsibilities.      Specifically, ``the Authority expended funds for many items      that were not reasonable or necessary and did not support the      Authority's mission.'' Moreover, ``they neglected their      management and oversight responsibilities; wasted Authority      funds, at times for personal gain; circumvented existing      internal controls; and manipulated accounting records. These      conditions occurred because the Authority's management and      Board failed to exercise their fiduciary responsibilities and      did not act in the best interest of the Authority.''       HUD also failed to ensure that millions in Disaster Housing      Assistance Program (DHAP) funding, awarded following      Hurricane Ike, were used properly or as intended. Instead,      HCHA awarded a lucrative consulting contract to the former      HCHA Board chairman Odysseus Lanier's firm just two months      after he resigned from the Board. The conflict-of-interest      waiting period is one year. Mr. Lanier's consulting firm      received ``$11.3 million from HCHA, according to agency      director Tom McCasland, most of it for work on some sort of      multi-state disaster response survey that nobody wanted.      Harris County tried to get $7 million in reimbursement for it      from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, but was denied,      according to the audit.'' Additionally, in 2008 the housing      authority purchased at least five high-end SUVs which were      subsequently donated to the Harris County Office of Emergency      Management and earmarked for five specific employees.       Purchasing $18,000 historic documents, spending $190,000 on      statues and monuments, and paying for chartered helicopter      flights is not a hallmark of ``one of the highest performing      housing authorities in the country.'' This is money that      should have been used to provide clean, safe, and affordable      housing for those in need. HUD must take greater steps to      safeguard taxpayer dollars, especially during this time of      budget cuts due to sequestration. Please provide the      following information:       1. What steps are being taken by HUD to recoup as much of      the $27 million in questionable spending outlined in the OIG      audit report?       Given the efforts that Mr. Rankin and other officials at      HCHA took to hide their questionable spending, have criminal      referrals been made to the Department of Justice? If so, for      what offenses? Who has been referred?       2. I have raised concerns about unreported conflicts-of-     interest at HCHA and other housing authorities that have cost      taxpayers millions. What steps are being taken by HUD to      tighten up conflict-of-interest reporting requirements and      increased oversight to reduce the questionable payments in      the future?       3. It is my understanding that HUD has conducted no      oversight of the billions in Disaster Housing Assistance      Program (DHAP) funding granted to HCHA and other housing      authorities along the Gulf Coast impacted by Hurricanes      Katrina, Rita and Ike. Please explain why this has not been      done and, given the recent financial problems at HCHA and      billions provided for Hurricane Sandy efforts, when we might      expect an audit to be conducted?       4. It is my understanding that neither the former HCHA      executive director, Guy Rankin IV, nor his new company,      International Housing Solutions, has been suspended or      disbarred from receiving federal funding through HUD. In      fact, Mr. Rankin may be trying to obtain or has already      received Hurricane Sandy funding even after allegedly wasting      millions in Hurricane Ike funding.       Please state whether HUD has suspended or disbarred Mr.      Rankin and/or International Housing Solutions, as well as      other bad housing authority actors, from receiving federal      funding.       Please also explain what steps HUD is taking to ensure that      Hurricane Sandy funding is used as Congress intended and not      lost to waste, fraud and abuse.       5. What specific changes have been and will be made to the      housing authority assessment program that will address the      many deficiencies in the current self-assessment program?      When will these changes be fully implemented?       6. Currently, the housing authorities' financial and      management audits are paid for by the housing authorities      themselves, which may result in conflicts of interest. What      alternatives to auditor contracting awards and payments are      being considered by in order to ensure that the auditors are      serving the taxpayers instead of housing authority      management?       Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this      matter. I would appreciate receiving your response to this      matter by July 31, 2013. Should you have any questions      regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact      Janet Drew of my staff.           Sincerely,                                          Charles E. Grassley,                                                   Ranking Member,     Committee on the Judiciary.                                  ____                                                      U.S. Senate,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                 Washington, DC, November 20, 2013     Hon. Shaun Donovan,     Secretary, Department of Housing and Urban Development,          Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary Donovan: I have been raising concerns about      questionable spending at public housing authorities (PHA)      across the United States. I have questioned excessive travel      spending at public housing authorities in the past, but the      Tampa Housing Authority (THA), a HUD high performer, appears      to have far surpassed those housing authorities in travel and      conference spending.       Recent investigative reports by Channel 10 News in Tampa      found that THA has spent in excess of $860,000 since 2009 for      staff and Board members to attend various conferences,      seminars and training programs. According to travel documents      provided by THA (see attached), staff and board members often      attend the same conferences throughout the United States,      some for the same organizations year after year, and often      attend multiple conferences in a single year. In addition to      travel costs, THA pays a conference fee for each attendee,      ranging between $400 and $1000. Every dollar that goes to      airfare, meals, lodging and conference fees, is another      dollar that cannot be used to help house homeless Tampa Bay      residents.       Additionally, these trips amount to thousands of man hours      spent away from the office and not serving the citizens of      Tampa. According to the travel documents, THA staff and board      members annually spend more than 500 work days outside the      office. While THA may argue the necessity for the conference      and training attendance, a vast majority of these trips      appear to be non-critical to housing authority business and      give the impression of being an excuse to take expensive      vacations paid for with taxpayer dollars.       Like other housing authorities I have been investigating,      THA has been spending limited federal funding for other      questionable expenses. The executive director, Jerome Ryans,      receives an annual salary of $214,000 plus a compensation      package which puts him well over the $155,500 salary cap.      Additional examples include: a new $7 million administrative      office with nearly $3 million in renovations and upgrades,      nearly $800,000 on salary and benefits for the public      relations department while paying $170,369 for a PR      consultant, $2.8 million in outside legal fees since 2009      while one outside lawyer is also married to a housing      authority employee.       In August, Executive Director Ryans complained that ``the      agency will also lose approximately 1 million dollars in      administrative fees that cover operational costs due to      sequestration.'' He also stated that ``it is our goal to      continually find ways or opportunities to reduce overall      departmental costs.'' I strongly suggest that Mr. Ryans and      HUD start by curtailing attendance at conferences and      training seminars, excessive salaries, consulting and legal      fees.       Please provide the following:       1. Please describe the steps being taken by HUD to rein in      excessive spending on travel, conferences and training at THA      and other housing authorities across the country and explain      why those steps have been ineffective in preventing the      abuses described above.       2. The complete annual compensation packages of all THA      employees, including salaries, bonuses and any other      compensation (health care, retirement, etc).       3. A copy of most recent employment contracts for the      executive director and all THA financial statements filed      with HUD, including any statements made about executive      director salary and all benefits.       4. Complete documentation of the remodeling expenditures      for the new headquarters building.       5. The total number of credit cards issued to THA,      including any provided to THA board members.       6. All legal bills and professional service and consulting      fees paid by the PHAs. Please also document all conflict of      interest waivers.       7. A list of all take-home vehicles provided by the housing      authorities and the names of the employees who drive them.       Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this      matter. I would appreciate your response by December 6, 2013.      Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to      contact Janet Drew of my staff.           Sincerely,                                              Charles E. Grassley,     Ranking Member.                                  ____                                                      U.S. Senate,                                    Committe on the Judiciary,                                  Washington, DC, January 8, 2014.     Hon. Shaun Donovan,     Secretary, Department of Housing and Urban Development,          Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary Donovan: The Dayton Daily News recently      reported questionable management decisions at the Dayton      (Ohio) Housing Authority, renamed Greater Dayton Premier      Management (GDPM). I want to ensure that HUD taxpayer dollars      are used for safe, affordable housing instead of questionable      compensation packages.       According to the article, the GDPM Board of Commissioners      recently fired the interim CEO, Al Prude. Mr. Prude was      removed by a Board resolution which stated that the housing      authority ``is going to a `new business model' that consists      of four agency directors acting as a team that will meet      twice a day to run the agency.'' Instead of hiring a new CEO      immediately, the housing authority is paying the four      department heads each an additional $1,000 per week to cover      the CEO duties. At that rate, the housing authority is      spending $16,000 per month or $192,000 per year for the      department directors to cover the CEO duties, with no time      frame for naming a replacement. The former CEO was paid just      over $123,000 per year which now looks like a bargain.       It also appears that prior to his removal, Mr. Prude      received two very lucrative pay raises on one day last year.      The first bumped his salary ``from $98,542 to $123,157 on      Aug. 30, 2012, along with a check for back pay through June      1, when he was appointed interim CEO.'' The second was an      increase ``from $81,000 to $98,542, retroactive to the date      of his hire on Jan. 31, 2011.'' He also received a lump-sum      payment for back pay back to his hire date. The raises were      signed by himself, the board chairman and the chief financial      officer.       Although the GDPM Board decided to terminate Mr. Prude, the      decision to pay the department heads to cover his duties      indefinitely appears to be even more expensive than the      previous CEO. Therefore, I am requesting the following      information for the period of 2008 to the present:       1. Please provide an explanation for why a housing      authority is allowed to pay an additional $16,000 per month      for four individuals to act as CEO. Please also document how      HUD intends to enforce the $155,000 salary limit when the      duties are split among several individuals.       2. The complete annual compensation packages of all GDPM      employees, including salaries, bonuses, retroactive pay,      separation pay and any other compensation (health care,      retirement, etc.).       3. Provide a list of all legal bills and professional      service and consulting fees paid by GDPM.       4. Please document any Conflict of Interest waivers filed      by the GDPM and Board of Commissioners with HUD.       5. What additional oversight is being conducted by HUD      regarding payments to outside consultants and law firms by      all housing authorities across the country to ensure that all      federal funds, including stimulus and disaster funds, are      protected against waste, fraud and abuse? Please be specific.       6. Provide all travel records for all employees at GDPM as      well as the GDPM Board members.       7. Please provide the names of all nonprofit affiliates      with ties to GDPM. Please include the names of all officers      and their salary/benefit packages.       Accordingly, please provide responses by no later than      January 24, 2014. If you have any questions regarding this      letter, please have your respective staff members contact      Janet Drew.           Sincerely,                                              Charles E. Grassley,     Ranking Member.                                  ____                                Congress of the United States,                                  Washington, DC, January 9, 2014.     Hon. Shaun Donovan,     Secretary, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development,          Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary Donovan: Recent reports in the Raleigh News      & Observer, which we have attached to this letter, have shone      a light on the situation surrounding the executive director      of the Raleigh, North Carolina Housing Authority (RHA) and      his extremely generous salary and fringe benefits.      Specifically, we are concerned that the RHA--a HUD ``high      performer''--allows its executive director, Steve Beam, to be      on paid vacation from the housing authority for nearly three      months a year to pursue his outside hobbies and interests.       According to the article, Mr. Beam is one of the most      highly paid housing authority executive directors in the      country. His compensation package, which includes ``salary,      bonuses, longevity payments and car allowance,'' totals      approximately $280,000 per year. This year, the RHA board      also increased his annual vacation time from 24 days to 30      days per year. In return for the high salary, Mr. Beam is      only required to work 7.5 hours per day.       In addition to the generous salary and vacation days he      receives through his contract, Mr. Beam also accumulates      comp-time for any hours he works over 7.5 hours. This benefit      is extremely unusual for such a highly paid manager and Mr.      Beam has used it to rack up over four months of paid vacation      from 2010 to the present. In fact, because of Mr. Beam's      unique 7.5 hour work day, over the course of one year he      accrues an additional two weeks of comp-time simply by      working a traditional eight hour day. All told, he used 22.5      comp days in 2009, 23.5 in 2010, 20 in 2011, 20.5 in 2012,      and only 14 through October 2013.       It appears however, that despite these extremely generous      benefits, Mr. Beam still uses government funded time to      indulge his interest in magic tricks, which he referred to as      his ``business/hobby'' in a statement to the News & Observer.      The newspaper spotlighted several examples of Mr. Beam's      using work time to pursue his hobby including posting to a      website called ``The Magic Cafee.'' Given that the RHA board      specifically gives Mr. Beam months of vacation unavailable to      other housing authority executives in order to pursue his      interest in magic, it is extremely concerning that Mr. Beam      was unable to confine his ``business/hobby'' to his multiple      months of vacation which suggests the RHA does not have      sufficient oversight controls over Mr. Beam's activities.       The RHA executive director and board believe that RHA      functions well while the executive director is away from the      office for nearly three months a year mainly because RHA has      a ``capable'' deputy executive director to pick up the slack.      As the RHA receives the vast majority of its funds from HUD,      it is important for HUD to hold Mr. Beam and the RHA board      accountable for their actions. To examine the extent of HUD's      oversight over Mr. Beam in the RHA, please answer the      following questions and provide the requested documents:       1. An explanation for why Mr. Beam is allowed to accumulate      up to three weeks of comp time while working less than the      standard 40 hour work week.       2. An explanation for how RHA is deemed a ``high      performer'' when the executive director is away from the      office for nearly three months per year.       3. The complete list of annual compensation packages of all      RHA employees, including salaries, bonuses, longevity pay,      car allowance and/or take-home vehicle, vacation and comp      time and any other compensation (health care, retirement,      etc).       4. Please review and document the executive director's use      of RHA office equipment to conduct non-RHA business.       5. Provide a list of all legal bills and professional      service and consulting fees paid by RHA.       6. Please provide copies of all employee financial      disclosure forms and document any Conflict of Interest      waivers filed by the RHA and RHA board with HUD.       7. Provide all travel records for all employees at RHA as      well as the RHA board members.       8. Please provide the names of all nonprofit affiliates      with ties to RHA. Please include the names of all officers      and their salary/benefit packages.       Accordingly, please provide responses by no later than      January 24, 2014. If you have any questions regarding this      letter, please have your respective staff members contact      Janet Drew with Senator Grassley or Kris Denzel with      Congressman Holding.           Sincerely,     Charles E. Grassley,       U.S. Senator.     George Holding,       U.S. Congressman.                                  ____                                                      U.S. Senate,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                 Washington, DC, January 16, 2014.     Hon. Shaun Donovan,     Secretary, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development,          Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary Donovan: A recent series of articles in the      Bradenton Herald describe very serious financial      mismanagement issues at the Bradenton (Florida) Housing      Authority (BHA). Specifically BHA--a HUD ``high performer''--     has provided lucrative employee compensation packages that      helped put the housing authority $400,000 in debt. HUD has      already removed both employees for attendance and vacation      time infractions, but there appear to be other financial and      management problems as well.       The BHA employee manual contains very questionable      provisions for take-home vehicles, lucrative bonus and leave      policies, and retirement benefits. According to an October 6,      2013 Bradenton Herald article, at least half of the ten      person staff have take-home vehicles. According to page 49 of      the BHA employee handbook, the take-home vehicles are      ``available for both business and personal use,'' and ``BHA      issues a fuel credit card for each vehicle user.''      Additionally, the employee is required to ``arrange for      routine vehicle servicing . . . through the Development      Director'' and the vehicle must be ``cleaned every other week      inside and out at a designated car wash.''       If employees with fifteen or more years of service like      their take-home vehicles, they have the option of keeping      them when they retire or voluntarily leave. According to the      employee handbook, the employee ``will be entitled to either      the vehicle that they are driving at the time of the      separation or $10,000.'' Moreover, the policy provides that      ``if said vehicle is leased, the Housing Authority will      immediately pay the lease in full.'' Interestingly, the      policy places no limit on the value of the vehicle or the      lease to be paid off.       Most BHA employees are given two bonuses every year, one in      June and one in December. According to the employee handbook,      employees who have been with BHA for at least a year are      eligible for a bonus of up to ten percent which is determined      by the executive director. The bonus is paid in June and even      employees who retire or voluntarily leave during the year      receive a prorated bonus. According to an October 20, 2013,      Bradenton Herald article, BHA instituted a new bonus policy      in February 2013, without Board approval, that gave every      employee a ten percent raise in March 2013. The second bonus,      a longevity award, is paid in December of each year (see      Table below). Even employees who voluntarily left BHA after      five or more years of employment are paid a prorated amount.------------------------------------------------------------------------    For service of at least:        But less than:      The Amount is:------------------------------------------------------------------------2 years.........................  3 years...........  $1003 years.........................  4 years...........  $2004 years.........................  5 years...........  $3005 years.........................  10 years..........  1 Weeks Pay10 years........................  15 years..........  Two Weeks Pay15 years........................  20 years..........  Three Weeks Pay20 years........................  ..................  4 Weeks Pay------------------------------------------------------------------------       The BHA has very liberal leave policies including 15 hours      of vacation and 15 hours of sick leave per month and bonus      vacation hours after five years of service. Although the      employee handbook allows for two days off for Christmas and      one for New Year's Day, BHA had been closing between December      20th and January 2nd for the Christmas and New Year's      holidays. Plus, an employee can, according to the employee      handbook, cash out between 40 and 160 sick leave hours twice      per year and may convert vacation hours to sick leave hours      in order to cash them out. In fact, the Bradenton Herald      estimates that the former executive could cash out ``between      $7127.50 and $28,510 at a time'' so he could have pocketed an      extra $14,225 to $57,020 per year.       Meanwhile, BHA board members failed due diligence and      oversight responsibilities. The board consistently passed      ``resolutions without seeing the language'' and the chairman      now wants to review employee policies only after the      executive director was fired. Another board member stated      ``HUD is the official agency.'' And, ``They didn't call me      and say, `Did you know your budget is in deficit.' ''       To examine the extent of HUD's oversight over BHA      management, please answer the following questions and provide      the requested documents from years 2008 to present:       1. A copy of the former BHA executive director's most      recent employment contract.       2. The total amount of salary and compensation paid to the      former executive director.       3. The complete annual compensation payments to all BHA      employees, including salaries, bonuses, longevity awards and      cashed out sick time any other compensation (health care,      retirement, take-home vehicle).       4. The total number and description of BHA take-home      vehicles. The number of BHA vehicles or $10,000 payments      given as a retirement/separation benefit, as well as whether      or not the housing authority paid off the vehicle lease.       5. The total number of fuel and other credit cards      authorized by BHA. Please include the names of each employee      provided with a fuel or other credit card, and the monthly      fuel charges paid by BHA.       6. In addition to every Friday, please document every week      day (both full and half) per year that the BHA has been      closed and for what reason.       7. A list of all legal bills and professional service and      consulting fees paid by BHA, including all vehicle service      bills.       8. Please provide all financial disclosure forms completed      by BHA employees and document any Conflict of Interest      waivers filed by the BHA and Board of Commissioners with HUD.       9. Provide all travel records for employees at BHA as well      as the BHA Board members.       Accordingly, please provide responses by no later than      January 31, 2014. If you have any questions regarding this      letter, please have your respective staff members contact      Janet Drew.           Sincerely,                                              Charles E. Grassley,                                                   Ranking Member.
