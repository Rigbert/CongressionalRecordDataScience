Speaker, I want to clarify the situation. We have historically, on this bill, on the previous question, had a vote. We have had a vote because we think the public is entitled to that. If the previous question were not passed, an amendment may be in order to preclude the cost of living adjustment for Members.  Long ago we decided, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hastert), the Speaker of the House, and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Gephardt), the minority leader, that that was the fair and proper thing to do. Everybody in the leadership on both sides has agreed that cost-of-living adjustments that go to everybody in the Federal service are justified.  This is not in that sense a pay raise. It is what most Federal Government employees receive, and we will receive less than, by about 1.2 percent, than Federal employees do.
