 President, I want to speak on a subject that I speak on often on the floor of the Senate, the Department of Defense's illegal progress payment policy. Since early this year, I have spoken on this subject many times. Most recently I spoke about the Department's commitment to bring the policy into compliance with law.  This commitment was made by the man who is now the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Mr. John Hamre. This commitment was made on July 22. I spoke about this 2 weeks ago, that he had a meeting with the leadership of the Armed Services Committee. At that meeting there was an agreement among all of us that certain accounting procedures would be brought into accordance with the law. Mr. Hamre gave us his word. He promised to bring the policy into compliance with the law on October 1 of this year. October 1 has come and gone and the illegal policy is still in operation. The Department of Defense is not complying with the law of the land.  Recent news reports suggest that Mr. Hamre is a man of deep spiritual beliefs. I know him to be that way. The roots of his faith go back to his Lutheran upbringing in the small South Dakota town of Willow Lake. His father was the town's church council president. His grandfather was the pastor. John himself went to Harvard Divinity School to prepare for the ministry.  So, Mr. President, it seems to me his faith runs deep, and I respect that. I remind John about some Scripture. The Bible teaches us to: always ``do as you promised.'' I will read a passage from Joshua 23:14: ``You know with all your heart and soul that not one of all the good promises the Lord your God gave you has failed. Every promise has been fulfilled; not one has failed.''  The Bible teaches us that God kept His word, and He expects the same from each of us. I hope that Mr. Hamre will keep his word that was made on July 22.  Now, I know it is not always possible to keep promises because sometimes things happen in the interim that bring about a change of events that might cause some change of the original stance. Sometimes there are unforeseen events that stand in the way. But there has to be an honest effort.  Mr. President, I'm trying hard to understand why the October 1 deadline is being ignored. There are three letters that helped explain Mr. Hamre's behavior.  First, there is a letter from the Armed Services Committee, signed by the chairman, Senator Thurmond, and the ranking minority member, Senator Levin. It is addressed to Secretary Cohen, and dated September 26, 1997.  Second, we have a letter from the inspector general, Ms. Eleanor Hill, to Mr. Hamre, dated September 30, 1997.  Third, there is Mr. Hamre's letter back to the Armed Services Committee, dated October 1, 1997.  I ask unanimous consent to have these letters printed in the Record so my colleagues have the benefit of the entire text.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                  Committee on Armed Services,                               Washington, DC, September 26, 1997.     Hon. William S. Cohen,     Secretary of Defense, The Pentagon, Washington, DC       Dear Secretary Cohen: Two months ago the Department      proposed a change to the Defense Federal Acquisition      Supplement (DFARS) to change its procedures for progress      payments under complex contracts using money from more than      one appropriation. Although there is no evidence that the      existing progress payment system has ever resulted in a      violation of the Antideficiency Act, we understand that the      Department does not believe that current procedures are      capable of meeting all applicable legal requirements.       The Council or Defense Industry Associations (CODSIA) has      indicated to us that the Department is considering the      possibility of implementing these new procedures effective      October 1, 1997--prior to final action on proposed DFARS      change. CODSIA estimates the changes to contractor accounting      and billing systems required by these new procedures could      cost the industry in excess of $1.3 billion a year.      Additional costs would be incurred by the taxpayers in      connection with the requirement for the Department to      manually process progress payment requests.       We ask that you review the proposed changes, consider all      public comments, and weigh the costs and benefits to the      taxpayers and the Department of Defense before these new      procedures are implemented by the Department. We would also      appreciate if you would let us know of any legislative      changes that may be needed to assist you in addressing this      issue in a rational and cost-effective manner.       Thank you for your attention to this matter.           Sincerely,     Carl Levin,       Ranking Minority Member.     Strom Thurmond,       Chairman.                                  ____                                            Department of Defense,                                            Inspector General,                                Arlington, VA, September 30, 1997.     Memorandum for Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)     Subject: Progress Payment Distribution       We do not concur with the recommendation that the Deputy      Secretary of Defense approve an open ended deferral in      implementing revised progress payment distribution practices.       Recently we were advised by the Office of the Director,      Defense Procurement, that an interim rule specifying the role      of contracting officers in the new procedures could not be      issued for at least 60 days. Likewise, we do not believe that      the Defense Finance and Accounting Service is ready to      proceed with the originally planned October 1, 1997      implementation. A deferral of the implementation date is      therefore necessary, which is dismaying in light of the      several years that the Department has had to address this      problem.       At a minimum, we believe that the Deputy Secretary should      establish a revised implementation date no later than January      1, 1998. Any reviews of cost implications or other relevant      factors should be executable well before that date.                                                     Eleanor Hill,     Inspector General.                                  ____                              The Deputy Secretary of Defense,                                  Washington, DC, October 1, 1997.     Hon. Strom Thurmond,     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter is in response to your      September 26, 1997, letter to Secretary Cohen regarding      changes in the manner in which the Department distributes      progress payments. Consistent with your request, the      Department will review the proposed changes, consider all      public comments, and weigh the costs and benefits to the      taxpayers and the Department of Defense before these new      procedures are implemented. If the analysis indicates that      legislative changes are needed to address this issue in a      more rational and cost effective manner, such changes will be      proposed.       Additionally, the Department has initiated a change to the      Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to      require that contractors provide the breakout of the progress      payment. The DFARS change cannot be effected until January      1998 because of the time required to complete statutory      administrative actions. Additional time is needed in order to      submit the proposed rule and its cost-benefit analysis to the      Congress, GAO, and OMB and for the required 60-day      congressional waiting period to elapse.       As a result of your request, and the need for additional      time to comply with statutory and administrative      requirements, I am delaying implementation of the planned      policy changes regarding the distribution of progress      payments. Those changes, which were scheduled to be      implemented on October 1, 1997, are being delayed until      January 1998, pending further review and evaluation of the      proposed changes.       A copy of this letter has been provided to Senator      Grassley.           Sincerely,                                                    John J. Hamre.
