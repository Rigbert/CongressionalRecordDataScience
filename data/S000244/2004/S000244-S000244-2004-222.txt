Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 1787, the Good Samaritan Volunteer Firefighter Assistance Act of 2004. I would like to thank the sponsor of the bill, the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Castle), for bringing attention to an important issue.  This straightforward, narrowly tailored legislation deserves our support, as do the volunteer firefighters who stand to benefit from its passage. The purpose of the bill is simple and clear: To encourage increased donation of surplus firefighting equipment to volunteer firefighting units by removing civil liability barriers that currently cause some corporation, individuals, and professional firefighting entities that destroy or mothball surplus or used equipment rather than to donate it.  The Committee on the Judiciary had a hearing on H.R. 1787 on July 20, 2004, at which Chief Philip Stittleburg of the National Volunteer Fire Council testified in favor of the bill. According to the testimony received by the committee, volunteer fire departments account for 75 percent of all the Nation's firefighters and represent a cost savings estimated to be as much as $37 billion annually, which taxpayers would otherwise have to spend if those services that volunteers provide had to be replaced with full-time paid professional firefighters.  Many of these volunteer departments are in rural areas, with fewer resources, and face a constant struggle to provide their members with adequate equipment to protect local communities. Volunteer fire departments have traditionally benefited from the donation of surplus or used equipment when professional fire departments or firefighting units of private enterprises upgrade or replace their own equipment. Surplus equipment may include hoses, oxygen masks, protective clothing or even fire trucks. However, today, some of this needed, usable, and safe equipment is being destroyed or put in storage by the better-equipped fire units instead of being donated to the volunteer departments.  Many times donations never occur because of the fear of legal liability exposure if such equipment were ever to fail, even through no fault of the donor. The legislation before us would remove both the fear and reality of such liability for potential donors of fire safety or fire rescue equipment to volunteer departments.  The bill before us is a good, common-sense idea, but not an entirely original one. Ten States have already passed versions of this legislation at the State level. Texas, most notably, passed a law 7 years ago granting liability relief to donors of firefighting equipment that have resulted in approximately $13 million worth of donations to over a thousand volunteer departments since 1997. However, volunteer firefighter advocates do not have the resources to wage legislative campaigns in the remaining 40 States.  At a time when the Federal Government is more involved than ever in funding local first responders, Congresshas the responsibility to do whatever it can to help volunteer firefighters get better equipment at zero taxpayer cost. What the bill does is simply provide that a person or entity who donates fire control or rescue equipment to a volunteer department will not be liable for civil damages for damage or loss proximately caused by the equipment after donation.  Despite some allegations by trial lawyers and other opponents, what the bill does not do is to protect the manufacturer of such equipment. It does not protect any donor whose actual mission constitutes gross negligence or intentional misconduct. Furthermore, the bill does not endanger the safety of firefighters. As Chief Stittleburg testified at the committee's hearing, fire chiefs are responsible for inspecting donated and purchased equipment alike, and no chief would allow their firefighters to answer an alarm using equipment that was not properly inspected and deemed fit for use.  Given a choice between no equipment and donated equipment that they inspect before using, volunteer fire departments are clearly in favor of the latter. And given a choice between believing trial lawyers versus volunteer firefighters about the need for use and safety of donated equipment, I will choose the latter.                              {time}  1130  Mr. Speaker, today we have an opportunity to provide some limited, commonsense relief to Good Samaritan donors of needed equipment to Members' own local fire departments and to the communities that rely upon volunteer firefighters. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1787.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
