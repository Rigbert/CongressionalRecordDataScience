 President, last month marked the end of a distinguished career for Laurel County clerk Dean Johnson. Dean recently retired after 37 years of public service to his community, our Commonwealth, and this country. Today I would like to take a moment to reflect on my friend's many contributions to Laurel County and to thank him for his dedication to Kentucky.  First drawn to public service at a young age through organizations like the Key Club and the Future Farmers of America, Dean spent his career focused on integrity and efficiency. After serving in the Armed Forces and for 4 years as the county's treasurer, Dean was elected Laurel County clerk in 1985. His leadership has brought substantial innovation and development to this eastern Kentucky community.  In my State, a county clerk is responsible for providing a broad range of services to Kentuckians, including everything from voter registration and election management to licensing and recordkeeping. During Dean's tenure, the Laurel County clerk's office introduced new infrastructure and implemented new procedures to better serve a growing population. Running an election has changed quite a bit in Laurel County since Dean entered office, but his dedication has helped promote access to the ballot box for more than 44,000 registered voters.  In addition to his work in Laurel County, Dean collaborated with his peers to share best practices in the Kentucky County Clerks' Association. Earning both their trust and respect, he served a term as the organization's president, helping deliver essential services across Kentucky. Like other county clerks, Dean supported his fellow veterans by repurposing license plates into birdhouses. The products are sold with proceeds benefiting our Commonwealth's veterans.  Over the years, I have enjoyed working with Dean on behalf of our constituents, and I am proud to salute this man of great accomplishment. In his retirement, Dean plans to do more of what he loves most: spending time with his daughter, Teresa, and his granddaughter, Rebecca. He will also continue to oversee his 175-acre cattle farm. As he begins this next chapter, I would like to wish him the very best, and I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in thanking Laurel County clerk Dean Johnson for his decades-long service of our State.  Mr. President, the Sentinel-Echo in London recently published a profile of Dean's accomplished career. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  [From the Sentinel-Echo, Dec. 26, 2018]                Johnson Reflects on 37 Years of Service                           (By Nita Johnson)       Society has changed drastically in the last 30 years--with      technology being one of the major advancements.       As Laurel County Clerk Dean Johnson fills his final days in      the position he has held for 33 years, he credits technology      as the most advantageous developments for his office      operations.       When Johnson took office as clerk in 1986, he came from a      four-year term as county treasurer. In both offices, most      paperwork was done on typewriters--a business machine that is      now nearly obsolete. But when the technology craze hit full      force, the first aspect of the clerk's office was to have      computerized vehicle tag registrations.       Another huge change came in the voter registration      processes--due to technological advancements and the growth      in population over the years.       ``When I came in, there were only 26 precincts,'' Johnson      said. ``We had those big voting machines that were the size      of a refrigerator.''       Within a couple of years, however, the use of Microvote was      created--the small blue ``suitcase'' style machine used to      cast votes.       ``We've moved to the self contained machines now because of      the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) because all the      machines have to be compliant with that,'' he said. ``The      other machines were hard for people to use if they were in a      wheelchair. With that, we had to relocate some of the      precincts because some didn't have handicapped access.''       Laurel County now boasts 45 precincts, all ADA compliant.       While Johnson said he hasn't seen a huge increase in voter      registration or turnout, he said the division from 26      precincts in the mid-1980s to the current 45 precincts does      reflect on the county's increased population.       ``The precincts divisions are done by the population in the      areas, not the number of registered voters in an area,'' he      explained. ``And the population is always determined by the      latest Census.''       He feels that the Laurel County Clerk's office has always      maintained a high level of integrity and efficiency dealing      with the public for motor vehicle registrations, transfers,      voter registration and election procedures, and maintaining      the massive load of deeds, mortgages, and other legal      documents that fall under the scope of that office. And      Laurel County has excelled in being some of the first      counties in the state to utilize technology to better serve      the public.       ``We were among the first counties in the state to create a      computerized absentee ballot form. I worked with a guy to      simulate the state forms,'' he said. ``Right now we have      44,000 registered voters in the county.''       The clerk's office was also one of the first offices in the      county to receive and use a FAX machine, he said, adding that      the Laurel County Public Library was one of the first to      offer the FAX service.       The growth in the county's population over the past 30      years has massively increased the work load for those who      serve in that office.       ``When I came here in 1986, it was the 160th year of Laurel      County being established,'' Johnson added. ``There were fewer      than 200 mortgage books. Now we have approximately 1,200.''       While the workload of the deputy clerks in the office has      increased to huge proportions over the past three decades,      Johnson said the application of technological advancements      has not caused a large increase in the employees needed in      his office.       ``When I started, there were 10 employees and now we have      18, so we haven't had a big increase in the employees because      of the computer systems,'' he explained. ``This office has      come from a gross intake of $8 million to $15.5 million and      we've never had a non-compliant comment in the 37 years I've      worked for the county.''       Being the Laurel County Clerk required Johnson to interact      with other clerks across the state over the years--some      associations for which he said will remain dear to his heart.       ``I built a rapport with other clerks and I was active in      the Kentucky County Clerks' Association,'' he said. ``I      served one term as president.''       He has many other accomplishments for which he is proud--     one of which is the efficiency of tabulating the votes on      election night. With that process, the election officers      returning their precincts totals are met at the back entrance      of the Laurel County Courthouse and their equipment unloaded      by persons approved by the local election commission members.      The officers then carry in the case containing the printouts      of the votes and sign in for their particular precinct, which      are processed in the lobby in the ground floor near the Broad      Street entrance. The printouts are then taken to the clerk's      office on the second floor where the employees of the clerk's      office then separate the documents and record the votes.      Although the polls close at 6 p.m., most precincts have      submitted their results and the final count is completed and      reported by 7:30 p.m.       ``I'm very proud of the efficiency we have on election      night,'' Johnson said. ``That goes to the employees in this      office and the state associations of elections for the      efficient way we process the votes and the accuracy we      have.''       As an example, Johnson reflected on the 2016 Gubernatorial      race in which Republican candidate James Comer lost to now      Governor Matt Bevin by a mere 83 votes.       ``We had to do a re-canvas,'' Johnson said. ``That      (statewide) re-canvas was completed on Thursday, with the      result coming out the same, of course. We aren't like Florida      and Georgia, that took weeks to do a re-canvas. In fact, in      national elections, Kentucky is nearly always the first to      report their results.''       Johnson has also served as chair of the Laurel County      Republican party, stepping down this year after four years in      that position. He also has been involved with KACo (Kentucky      Association of Counties) for 12 years, is a veteran, is a      Shriner and member of the local masonic lodges.       His interest in being a public servant came early in his      teens, being a President of his school's Key Club and FFA      (Future Farmers of America). He learned early on about      working hard, and said he always had a drawing toward      political issues.       ``As a kid I liked to be active in things and I always      liked being involved in politics,'' he said. ``There were two      people in politics that I always admired--Boyd Boggs who was      a county judge executive and later the sheriff, and Dwight      Eisenhower. Those two had given a lot and I wanted to be able      to help people. As the clerk, you are in the position to help      people and I've tried to do that, not just with questions      about elections or vehicle registered. Other people just come      in and ask about different things and I always tried to help      them the best I could. I leave here with a good feeling      because I think I've done that.''       His political interests also brought him another      accomplishment for which he is very proud.       ``I was the Laurel County campaign chair and we brought      George H.W. Bush to the Bush community,'' he said. ``I was      also the chair when George W. Bush and (former Governor)      Ernie Fletcher came here.''       In fact, the shelves that line a section of Johnson's      office have a picture of the late president, George H.W.      Bush, with Johnson when Bush visited the Bush Fire      Department. Johnson laughs when looking at the picture now,      saying, ``My hair was a different color then.''       Johnson is also proud of his home county and of the many      advancements that have come to the residents of this      community.       ``This county has been aggressive in growing and using its      natural resources,'' he said. ``We've had good leadership and      that continues on today. I hope we keep on and keep our best      and brightest here and supply them with jobs so they can make      a decent living and stay here.''       Johnson is also very dedicated in his church, Calvary      Baptist, where he has served as the adult Sunday School      teacher for several years. He stands true to his beliefs--     even when that belief is not the most popular or      ``progressive.''       But his greatest accomplishment--and joy--comes from his      daughter, Teresa, and his only grandchild, Rebecca. He looks      forward to spending more time with them and his son-in-law      while he continues to oversee the 175-acre farm where he      raises cattle.       ``I'm retiring as of December 31,'' he said. ``I'm going to      go home and relax.''                               ____________________
