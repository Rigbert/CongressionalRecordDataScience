Chairman, reclaiming my time, if I might say to the gentleman, he knows the problem with the Small Business Administration, why do we even have one? It is simply because so many people fall between the cracks because we as a country are more able to deal with large institutions. It is no different than smaller producers, for example. Most farmers who might raise something like asparagus or tomatoes, they do not know how to apply for competitive research grants. Oftentimes this is done in conjunction with our land grant universities who do work with many of our smaller producers; raspberry producers, for example, who have to worry with viruses on their crops. We have a lot of internal review that is done by the academic institutions working with these crops and with the individuals who grow them. Also, the USDA Cooperative Research Service works and makes sure that we are getting our money's worth.  So I think the gentleman is trying to do something worthy, but I think he has chosen the wrong vehicle to do it, and I oppose the amendment.
