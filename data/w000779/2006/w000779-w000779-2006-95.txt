President, I think we all know that during this part of the session the Senate is going to spend considerable time focusing on energy issues. That is certainly warranted because, if there is one thing that can be agreed on, getting a fresh energy policy is just about the most red, white, and blue step our country can take at this critical time.  During the course of this debate, one issue that is sure to come up is the issue of oil company profits. The oil companies have consistently said that they need these very large profits in order to have the funds to drill and explore for new energy sources. I certainly feel strongly about developing new energy sources and increasing production, but I have been concerned about the role of government. At a time when the oil companies are making record profits and charging record prices, Congress has still been making available record subsidies. To get some clarity on this issue, I believed it was important to get the Congressional Research Service, the independent authority, to look at these issues, to analyze the question of exactly where the oil companies are putting this gusher of revenue they have accumulated recently. The findings in the new report the Congressional Research Service has given to me are striking.  What the Congressional Research Service has found is that the return on equity of the major oil companies has gone up in the last few years six times; the amount of cash reserves of the major oil companies have has gone up, over the same time, about six times; but the amount of money the companies have devoted to exploration and capital investment has only doubled. So what that means, the bottom line, is that the major oil companies are only putting back in the ground a modest fraction of what they have been siphoning away from consumers at the pump across our country.  What I would like to do is break down this report and talk about where I believe Congress ought to go on a bipartisan basis in the years ahead.  On the issue of return on equity, I asked the Congressional Research Service to examine the years of 1999 to present. They found that, with respect to return on equity for the oil companies, it was about 4.5 percent in 1999 and it is nearly 30 percent as of last year. That is an increase of more than six times over the last 6 years. The Congressional Research Service also looked at the cash reserves of the largest oil companies over the last 6 years. They have found that this, as well, has gone up sixfold. So the companies are clearly sitting on gushers of cash from higher oil prices and higher gas prices that consumers are now paying across the country.  I believe it was then appropriate to have the Congressional Research Service analyze what the oil companies are doing with all of this money. Certainly the companies have made the argument that they are investing these profits in exploring for oil and developing new energy technology. That certainly is part of the story, but it is far from the whole picture.  According to the Congressional Research Service, the major oil companies have approximately doubled their exploration costs and their overall capital investment over the past 6 years, but that rate of increase is just a fraction of how much their cash reserves and their return on equity have grown over that period. In addition, Congressional Research Service experts indicate that much of the oil companies' capital investment has been for operating expenses, not for increasing production, and much of what they seem to have invested in exploration has gone for overseas exploration.  Again, you come back to what I think is the clear conclusion of this particular analysis: The American people are seeing the oil companies put back in the ground just a modest part of what the consumer is coughing up at gas pumps across the land.  One of the questions I hope we will ask over this next period of the Senate being in session is, Why are the oil companies not putting some of their burgeoning cash reserves into investment in other technologies, particularly new renewable energy technologies which could help the oil industry diversify and help reduce our Nation's dependence on foreign energy? We ought to examine that issue, and certainly what the Congressional Research Service has done for my office makes a different contribution with respect to this debate and one that I think warrants thorough examination.  The Congressional Research Service looked, for me, at the 10-K reports the oil companies file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That is the information which Exxon and BP and Shell and Chevron and ConocoPhillips, Valero and Sunoco and Total report to their investors and to Wall Street. But what is in those 10-Ks that are given over to the Securities and Exchange Commission is not the story the oil companies seem to be telling the American people. The oil companies have been running ads in newspapers, claiming that their profits are in line with those of other industries. For example, the American Petroleum Institute has been running a newspaper ad showing the oil and natural gas industry's earnings of 5.9 cents on a dollar of sales, which is just above the 5.6-percent average for all industries. But suffice it to say, how many of the industries listed in these oil company ads are getting the 30-percent rate of return on equity that the Congressional Research Service has found in the report that I make public today?  The oil industry wants the public to believe that the record profits they are making are in line with other businesses, but it seems to me the Congressional Research Service analysis of the oil companies' own reports to the Government tells a very different story. This is particularly important right now because I believe the American people deserve a true accounting of what has been going on behind the numbers at the gas pump and where their hard-earned money has been going for the past several years. The report I release today on oil company financial data shows the oil industry's profits are not only greater than the profits of other businesses, but they also show how the oil companies have not been straight with the American people.  I also think it is timely to have this information about oil company profits because of the debate in both the Senate and in the other body about oil royalty giveaways to the oil industry. At a time of record prices, when oil companies are making record profits that are above what other industries are earning, the question is, Should the oil companies continue to get record subsidies from the taxpayers?  In May, the House of Representatives held a historic vote to put an end to taxpayer-funded royalty giveaways to profitable oil companies. The House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis to put a stop to this waste of taxpayer funds. Just a few weeks before that House vote, I spent nearly 5 hours trying to get a vote here in the Senate on exactly this issue. But despite that extended discussion, I was unable to get an up-or-down vote on my proposal to stop ladling out tens of billions of dollars of unnecessary subsidies to the oil sector.  I believe the Senate ought to have an opportunity to debate and vote on the oil royalty issue, and it seems especially timely after the new report the Congressional Research Service has supplied to me. With the Government Accountability Office estimating that tens of billions of taxpayer dollars could be lost as a result of the oil royalty program, this issue is too important to duck.  Over the next few weeks, as the Senate debates energy, I am hopeful that the Senate will think carefully about the findings of the independent Congressional Research Service. The Congressional Research Service analysis indicates to me that the oil industry in their advertisements and other promotions is not being straight with the American people. The Congressional Research Service has given us a good sense of where the oil sector is actually putting their money, and at a time when their rate of return on equity--30 percent--is certainly very strong and we look at where their cash reserves are--and they are sitting on piles of money--we are not seeing those dollars put back into exploration and development here in our country so we can have a new red, white, and blue energy policy that makes us independent from sources of foreign oil.  Let's work to have a debate in the Senate based on the facts. The Congressional Research Service has now given us illuminating information about what the facts are. Let's make better use of taxpayer dollars than to give away tens of billions of dollars in royalties in a program that began when oil was $19 a barrel and now frequently is well over $70 a barrel. This is a time for the Senate to come together on a bipartisan basis to look at these issues carefully. The Congressional Research Service report provides an opportunity to get the facts out--the real facts--about what is going on in this critical sector of our economy.  I ask unanimous consent that the report of the Congressional Research Service be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               Congressional Research Service,                                     Washington, DC, July 5, 2006.                               memorandum     To: Hon. Ron Wyden.     Subject: Oil Company Financial Data.     From: Robert Pirog, Specialist in Energy Economics and          Policy, Resources, Science, and Industry Division.       This memorandum is written in response to your request for      financial data for selected oil companies for the period 1999      to 2005. The companies for which you requested data are      ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, Valero, Chevron, ConocoPhillips,      Sunoco, and Total SA. The analysis is complicated by reason      of mergers and acquisitions among the selected firms,      differences in U.S. and international accounting standards,      currency exchange rates, differences in the size of the      selected companies, and differences in the extent to which      the selected companies participate in all aspects of the oil      business. The likely effects of these factors will be noted      in the appropriate sections of this memorandum.     Profit rates       Profit rates are usually expressed as net income as a      percentage of a relevant base; usually revenue, shareholder      equity, or assets. Each profit rate provides a different      measure of the success of the firm. Profit relative to      revenue shows how well the firm translates revenue into net      income. Profit relative to shareholder equity shows how      effective the firm is in utilizing the capital invested in      the firm by its owners, the shareholders. Profit relative to      assets shows how effective the firm is in utilizing its total      asset base to generate net income.       Table 1 shows the average return on revenue and the return      on equity for the eight selected oil companies. The averages      are simple averages; they do not assign weights to account      for the different sizes of the firms in the group.      ExxonMobil, the largest company in the group, has total      revenues over ten times as large as Sunoco, the smallest      company in the group. However, a weighted average would still      not account for the fact that the sample of eight companies      is only a fraction of the industry. For example, the Oil and      Gas Journal includes over 130 companies in its oil and gas      firms' earning report.           TABLE 1.

Over the seven year period, the average return on revenue      was 5.24 percent, while the average return on equity was      18.32 percent. Both profit measures increased when the recent      increases in the price of oil began in 2003. Two of the      companies in the data set, Valero and Sunoco, are refiners      and marketers with no crude oil production. These two firms      were not, therefore, positioned to benefit directly from      increases in the price of crude oil.     Cash reserves       Companies might accumulate cash reserves in anticipation of      a major merger or acquisition, before a share re-purchase, or      before a capital investment expenditure. In the case of the      selected oil companies, these reasons might be augmented by      the rapid expansion of sales revenues associated with the      increases in the prices of crude oil and products from 2003      through 2005. Large investment projects take time to plan and      execute, and it may be that the rapidly increasing revenues      these firms realized could not be efficiently allocated in      the available time.       Both upstream (exploration and production) and downstream      (refining and marketing) investments in the oil industry tend      to cost billions of dollars and take years to plan, complete,      and realize returns from. Investment decisions are based on      company estimates of the long-term, expected, price of oil.      It may not be that the current market price of oil is      equivalent to the companies' long-term expected price of oil.      If the long-term planning price of oil is significantly lower      than the current market price, it might appear that the      companies have not increased investment in capacity to a      degree commensurate with increased market prices.

Note: Shell, Valero, and ConocoPhillips data could  not be obtained for 1999. Shell data could not be obtained for 2000.       Table 2 shows that the cash reserves of the selected oil      companies have more than doubled from 2001 to 2005, the      period of complete data. In 2005, three companies,      ExxonMobil, Shell, and Chevron accounted for over 87 percent      of the total cash reserves.     Exploration and capital investment       Exploration expenses are undertaken to locate and develop      new commercially viable deposits of crude oil and natural      gas. Two of the eight companies in the data set, Valero and      Sunoco, have no exploration expenses since they operate only      in the downstream portion of the industry. Since oil fields      deplete over time and production tends to decline, oil      producers must carry out a successful exploration program to      keep their reserve and production positions constant.      However, it cannot be determined from financial data which      exploration expenses are ``net'' in the sense of increasing      production and reserves, and which are ``gross'', including      depletion replacement. As a result, increasing exploration      expenses are not necessarily tied to increased production      capability or reserves. Most of the firms also report dry      hole expenses in exploration. Dry holes do not add to either      production capacity or reserves.       Capital investment expenditures were drawn from the      companies cash flow statements. These values represent actual      outlays made during the year. As a result, the values for      capital investment reported in Table 3 represent gross      investment, rather than investment net of depreciation. In      the current economic environment, it is likely that all      investments, new, as, well as those that replace depreciated      assets, must pass a profitability test to be undertaken. As a      result, gross investment is likely to represent well the      companies investment decisions.TABLE 3.

Note: Shell and ConocoPhillips exploration data was  not available for 1999. ConocoPhillips capital investment data was not  available for 1999.     Conclusion       The oil industry operates in a volatile, short run market      in which many decisions have long term implications. The      upstream portion of the market is increasingly controlled by      national oil companies, not private firms. The market is also      affected by political forces.       The private oil companies have the responsibility of making      decisions in the best interests of their shareholders.      However, because their products are important to the      functioning of national economies, their decisions are also      of interest to the public. This dual responsibility must be      balanced by the companies.
