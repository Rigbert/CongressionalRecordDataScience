 You used the word homos in the military. You have insulted thousands of men and women who have put their lives on the line. I think they are owed----  Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, I would also say that if my friend in support of this amendment, if my friend from Oregon was involved in the nuclear freeze movement, I want to congratulate him. There are millions of Americans who wonder about the wisdom of spending millions and millions more dollars building more and more nuclear weapons at the same time as the Republicans are cutting back on Medicare, Medicaid, and student loans.  Furthermore, I find it incomprehensible that at a time when the vast majority of the people in this country are terribly concerned about what is going on in the environment, terribly concerned about the environmental implications of nuclear energy, that the American people do not know what is in their waterways, and that various military installations might be exempted from Federal regulatory practices.  So I very much applaud this amendment.
