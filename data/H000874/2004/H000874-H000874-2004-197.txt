Speaker, with respect to the appropriation bills, two are listed for next week, Interior and Homeland Security. Does the gentleman think it is possible that we will get to the Defense bill next week, or not?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield, I cannot foresee that we could get to the Department of Defense appropriations bill next week with all of the bills that we are trying to get to the floor, but I do anticipate the Department of Defense appropriations bill being one of the first bills we would do the following week.
