 President, one other thing. One thing we do agree on--in trying to end this exchange with something we do agree on--I think both the Democrats and Republicans agree the size of the Marines and Army is insufficient. I think there is bipartisan support in the Congress to increase the size of both the Army and the Marines. I think that is something we can agree on. Hopefully, that will be achieved in the coming years.                          ____________________
