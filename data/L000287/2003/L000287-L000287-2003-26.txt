Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of the resolution. As many of you know, I am a man of peace. During the 1960s, many of us involved in the Civil Rights movement were threatened with arrest for sitting in at lunch counters, standing in at segregated theaters, or marching for the right to vote; and sometimes we were arrested and jailed. We were charged with disturbing the peace or disorderly conduct, and we were very peaceful and we were orderly.  I never thought that as a Member of Congress I would be threatened with arrest by sitting in the library of the Committee on Ways and Means. As a Member of Congress and as a memberof the Committee on Ways and Means, I thought, I really believed that it was a safe place to meet and to discuss the business of the committee.  It is unreal, it is unthinkable that another Member of Congress would threaten to have another arrested for carrying out his or her congressional duties. In another period of time, a few short years ago, some of us stood up to Bull Conner in Birmingham, Alabama, and we stood up to Sheriff Clark in Selma, Alabama. And I must say to the chairman of this committee, we will not be intimidated. We will not be immobilized. We live in a democracy and not a police state.  What happened today in the Committee on Ways and Means should cause a sense of righteous indignation among all of us. As Democrats, as Members of this House, the People's House, we will not get lost in a sea of despair. We will continue to stand up and fight for what is right and for what is fair.  Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, may I request the time remaining on each side?
