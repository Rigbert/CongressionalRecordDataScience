The Clerk read as follows:       Amendment offered by Mr. Smith of New Jersey: In title XXI      (relating to authorization of appropriations for Department      of State and certain international affairs functions and      activities) insert at the end the following new chapter.                     CHAPTER 2--GENERAL LIMITATIONS     SEC. 2121. PROHIBITION ON FUNDING FOR ABORTION.       (a) In General.--       (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law or of this      Act, none of the funds authorized to be appropriated by this      Act for population assistance activities are authorized to be      available for any private, nongovernmental, or multilateral      organization that, directly or through a subcontractor or      subgrantee, performs abortions in any foreign country, except      where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus      were carried to term or in cases of forcible rape or incest.       (2) Paragraph (1) may not be construed to apply to the      treatment of injuries or illnesses caused by legal or illegal      abortions or to assistance provided directly to the      government of a country.       (b) Limitation on Lobbying Activities.--(1) Notwithstanding      any other provision of law or of this Act, none of the funds      authorized to be appropriated by this Act for population      assistance activities are authorized to be available for any      private, nongovernmental, or multilateral organization that      [[Page H5491]] violates the laws of any foreign country      concerning the circumstances under which abortion is      permitted, regulated, or prohibited, or that engages in any      activity or effort to alter the laws or governmental policies      of any foreign country concerning the circumstances under      which abortion is permitted, regulated, or prohibited.       (2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to activities in      opposition to coercive abortion or involuntary      sterilizations.     SEC. 2122, PROHIBITION ON FUNDING FOR COERCIVE POPULATION                    CONTROL METHODS.       Notwithstanding any other provision of law or of this Act,      none of the funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act      are authorized to be available for the United National      Population Fund (UNFPA), unless the President certifies to      the appropriate congressional committees that--       (a) the United Nations Population Fund has terminated all      activities in the People's Republic of China; or       (b) during the 12 months preceding such certification there      have been no abortions as the result of coercion associated      with the family planning policies of the national government      or other government entities within the People's Republic of      China. As used in this section the term ``coercion'' includes      physical duress or abuse, destruction or confiscation of      property, loss of means of livelihood, or severe      psychological pressure.       In section 2102(b)(2)(F), delete subsections (iii), (iv),      and (v).
