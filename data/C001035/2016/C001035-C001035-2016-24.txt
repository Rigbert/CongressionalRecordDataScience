President, today I wish to recognize the 100th anniversary of the founding of the York Fire Department in the town of York, ME. It is an honor to congratulate the dedicated firefighters, past and present, for their skill and courage in protecting their community.  The York Fire Department was established in the aftermath of a disastrous fire at a seaside resort hotel on January 26, 1916. At that time, the only fire protection in the town was headquartered at York Beach, some 3 miles away. Although the York Beach firefighters responded valiantly, the distance, winter conditions, and inadequate equipment prevented them from saving the large wooden structure.  A town with two distinct and distant residential and commercial districts clearly needed two fire departments, so immediately after the resort fire, the York Village and Corner Ever-Ready Volunteer Fire Company was organized, with Bert Newick as the first chief. Enthusiasm for this new endeavor was so high that one writer observed that ``it seemed as though three-quarters of the town's eligible young men were becoming volunteer firefighters.''  Enthusiasm remains just as high today. York Fire Department firefighters are true volunteers, receiving no compensation for their rigorous training and dangerous duties. In addition to advanced training in firefighting and hazardous materials response, the majority of York's volunteers have EMT or paramedic certification. The department has only three paid positions to ensure that the fire station is staffed around the clock.  The people of York are grateful for these efforts and have supported funding for many improvements to equipment and facilities through the years. Individual citizens have stepped forward to provide such vital equipment as the department's first two-way radios in 1954 and its first fire/rescue boat in 2004.  A special project of the York Fire Department Auxiliary, the Southern Maine Advanced Rehab Team, consists of people who want to help out but are unable to serve as firefighters. Their SMART truck provides drinking water, coffee, food, communications, and portable radio battery charging at fire scenes, as well as misting fans to cool the firefighters. These volunteers are invaluable at any fire scene and often respond to fires in neighboring towns.  Firefighters from throughout Maine will join in the centennial observance this September when the Maine State Federation of Firefighters holds its 53rd annual convention in York. The convention will coincide with the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks and will commemorate all firefighters who have lost their lives while saving the lives of others. Among those memorialized will be Lt. Wayne Fuller who was killed while responding to a fire in 1974, the only York firefighter to fall in the line of duty.  America's firefighters play a vital role in the security of our Nation and the safety of our people. Whether it is in response to a terrorist attack, a natural disaster, or a fire, Americans rely on our firefighters, and our firefighters always answer the call. The firefighters of York, ME, are a shining example of that commitment, and I join the people of their town in saluting them for a century of service.                          ____________________
