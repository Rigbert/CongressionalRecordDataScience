President, I am here to remember the life of Janine Johnson--formerly with the Senate's Office of Legislative Counsel--who sadly passed away last month while still in the prime of her young life of 37 years.  Janine served in the Senate for 13 years. Some of her major responsibilities included drafting child nutrition and agriculture legislation for me, and for many other Senators.  After beginning her work for the Senate, she had a hand in crafting every major child nutrition law while I was chairman of the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, when Senator Lugar took over as chairman after me, and for Chairman Tom Harkin.  She will be sorely missed as the Senate prepares to complete the child nutrition reauthorization this year.  She was a careful, creative, and precise drafter of some of America's most important nutrition laws, which stand now in silent testament to her life.  She was as cheerful and careful at 2:00 p.m. working out complicated drafts, as she was at 2:00 a.m. working on even more complicated drafts. My senior nutrition counsel for many years, Ed Barron, drove her home more than once after the metro closed at midnight.  I know how hard this tragic loss weighs on her friends and colleagues at the Senate Legislative Counsel's Office.  She was admired by her peers, her friends, and her Senate clients.  It was clear from an early age that Janine would be a star. She graduated first in her class from Winchester High School in Massachusetts.  In 1986, she graduated with high honors from Harvard Law School. She clerked for the Honorable Cecil Poole on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  Following her clerkship, she came to the Senate Office of Legislative Counsel.  According to Janine's friends here in the Senate, she loved life outside the Senate as much as her work within it. Janine loved theater, music, and swing dancing.  Of Janine it can truly be said, that there has ``passed away a glory from the Earth.''  The poet Wordsworth continues--     ``Though nothing can bring back the hour     Of splendor in the grass, of glory in the flower;     We will grieve not, rather find     Strength in what remains behind.''  Janine has touched many of our lives and honored the Senate with her dedicated and outstanding service.                          ____________________
