Mr. Chairman, I reluctantly rise in opposition to the amendment, and let me say that I have a deep respect for the gentleman from Alabama [Mr. Bachus] and I think he does a service in bringing this issue to the floor.  I chair the subcommittee that oversees the State Department and we have held a hearing in which I have asked a number of questions that go right to the heart of this issue of these excess properties. I do believe that the Department of State should be more aggressive in the disposition of those properties that are either excessive or no longer needed.  This provision is not necessary, however, because of the actions taken in the conference report for Commerce, Justice, and State Department appropriations for fiscal year 1997, in which the Department was directed to professionalize their asset management.
