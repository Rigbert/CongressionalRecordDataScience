Speaker, the United States has been built by great citizens who unselfishly dedicate their time to community service and volunteerism. The Lake Area United Way and its volunteers have worked diligently to assist those in need throughout Indiana's First Congressional District. The Lake Area United Way has organized a black tie fundraising gala in which all proceeds go to benefit its umbrella organizations. This affair will take place at the Raddison Star Plaza in Merrillville, IN on March 22, 1997.  This outstanding benefit would not take place without devoted individuals to make the event possible.

The mission of the Lake Area United Way is to bring together the resources of our community to assist people in helping themselves and one another. The Lake Area United Way is an organization that strives for continuous improvement in the quality of relationships with one another, volunteers, and all individuals and businesses in the community. The Lake Area United Way strives to achieve this goal by treating all people in a courteous and professional manner in order to instill confidence and trust in their organization. Their hallmark is the delivery of timely, high-quality service by being accessible and responsive to ensure satisfaction. At the same time, the organization works hard to effectively communicate the appropriate information in order to achieve the individual and organizational goals. The Lake Area United Way also strives to identify and resolve problems in a timely and satisfactory manner, while disseminating information about the funded services that help people, as well as the places where help is available.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other colleagues to join me in commending these distinguished volunteers and staff members of the Lake Area United Way for their continuing effort to improve the quality of life for Indiana's First Congressional District. In closing, I would like to extend my congratulations to the Lake Area United Way, as well as best wishes for a successful gala on March 22.                          ____________________
