It is an opportunity for the Republican House to argue for its budget.  I voted against the final version of the Senate budget, but I think we should go to conference and try to work out an agreement.

Let's do what the American people expect us to do; that is, to negotiate a conference report that then would be brought back to both Houses for consideration. That is what I urge my colleagues to do.
