 President, I rise today to honor the Spencer County FFA Dairy Judging Team for winning the 2008 National FFA Dairy Cattle Judging Contest. This team is comprised of four outstanding young ladies: Whitney Owen, Cassandra Peterson, Kelli Smitha, and Michella White.  After countless hours spent preparing for the Kentucky FFA Dairy Judging Contest, they were awarded top honors at the State competition last August. The team then had the privilege of representing the Commonwealth at the 2008 National FFA Dairy Cattle Judging Contest in Indianapolis, IN, where they were again victorious.  Founded in 1928 as the Future Farmers of America, the group that is today known as the National FFA Organization brings together students, teachers, and members of the agribusiness community to promote agricultural education. In Kentucky, the National FFA Organization has over 15,000 members spread across 145 chapters. And over 24,000 Kentucky middle- and high-school students are enrolled in agricultural education programs.  Agriculture is obviously an important sector of the economy for my State, and I am proud of the many young people and adults who work with the National FFA Organization in Kentucky to ensure that the Bluegrass State remains at the forefront of agricultural education and innovation for years to come. Members are always recognizable during their visits to our Nation's Capitol by their distinctive blue jackets.  By securing a first-place finish at the national competition, the Spencer County FFA Dairy Judging Team now has the opportunity to represent America this summer at the International Dairy Judging Contest in Scotland. FFA is known for producing many of our Nation's future leaders, and I won't be surprised to see that trend continuebased on the success Whitney, Cassandra, Kelli, and Michella have already achieved. I know my fellow Senators join me in wishing them the best of luck in their future endeavors.                          ____________________
