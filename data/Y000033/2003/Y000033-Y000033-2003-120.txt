Madam Speaker, I would like to enter the following letter into the Record.                                                   March 24, 2003.     Hon. Richard W. Pombo,     Chairman, Committee on Resources, Longworth House Office          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Pombo: Thank you for your letter with regard      to H.R. 961, the Upper Mississippi River Basin Protection Act      which provides for sediment and nutrient monitoring of the      watershed.       I recognize your desire to bring this bill before the House      in an expeditious manner and will not exercise my Committee's      right to a sequential referral of the legislation. By      agreeing to waive its consideration of the bill, however, the      Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure does not waive      its jurisdiction over H.R. 961. In addition, the      Transportation and Infrastructure Committee reserves its      authority to seek conferees on provisions of the bill that      are within its jurisdiction during any House-Senate      conference that may be convened on this legislation. I thank      you for your commitment in advance to support any request by      the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for conferees      on H.R. 961.       Your cooperation in this matter is very much appreciated.           Sincerely,                                                        Don Young,                                                         Chairman.
