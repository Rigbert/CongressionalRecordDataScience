President, I understand the thrust of what the distinguished Senator from Kansas wishes to do. I am inclined to agree with him.  I am worried that his amendment may be creating not just one, but two antitrust exemptions in the bill. I do not want, nor do I expect that he would want to create unnecessarily large loopholes in our antitrust laws.  I will support his amendment so we can go on to conference with it, because what he is trying to accomplish is something I think the majority of us here in this Senate would want to accomplish. I suggest that the distinguished Senator, between the time this bill leaves the Senate and goes to conference, may want to work with the distinguished Senator from Utah and myself to make sure that we do not create an antitrust exemption that goes beyond what the distinguished Senator wishes to accomplish.  I am not suggesting such an expertise in antitrust law that I could tell him precisely how we might do that, but there are a couple red flags here. My recommendation is that we pass the amendment, but then that the three of us, and any other Senators who may be interested, may want to look at it closely to make sure that it is drafted, one, to accomplish exactly what all of us want to accomplish, but, two, not to raise an antitrust problem in another area.  With that, Mr. President, I am perfectly willing to yield back the remainder of my time, if there is any time on this side.
