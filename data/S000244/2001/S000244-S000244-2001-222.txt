Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts).  Mr. Pitts. Mr. Speaker, we need to clarify something here. This issue is not about what the other side called a group of cells or insoulment or a leap of faith; it is about human life at its very beginning.  This amendment is not a cloning ban. It has a 10-year moratorium in it; but, in fact, for the first time this amendment would specifically make cloning legal, and it would require that human clones be killed after they are made, which is even more unethical.  Now, some have suggested that cloned embryos are not really embryos at all. That is ridiculous. We might as well say that Dolly, who began as a cloned sheep embryo, is not really asheep, even though now she is 5 years old.  Even President Clinton's Bioethics Advisory Commission was clear. The commission began its discussion fully recognizing that any effort in humans to transfer somatic cell nucleus into an enucleated egg, in other words, cloning, involves the creation of an embryo. Eighty-eight percent of the American people want cloning banned, not merely because they believe it is bad science, but because they think it is morally wrong.  Let us stop playing games with words. Reject the Greenwood amendment. Support Weldon-Stupak.  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record a letter from the National Right to Life Committee, Inc., and a copy of a letter written by Mr. Douglas Johnson:                                            National Right to Life                                              Committee, Inc.,                                    Washington, DC, July 30, 2001.   Federal panels and Researchers Agree: Human Cloning Creates Human                                 Embryos       Dear Member of Congress: At a press conference today,      Congressman Greenwood and Congressman Deutsch asserted that      the Greenwood-Deutsch substitute amendment to the Weldon-     Stupak bill (H.R. 2505) would allow ``therapeutic cloning,''      but they asserted that this process would not involve the      creation of any human embryos.       This ``argument,'' if it can be called that, shows a      breathtaking lack of candor. For years, federal bio-ethics      review bodies have acknowledged that the process of somatic      cell nuclear transfer would indeed produce human embryos. For      example, President Clinton's handpicked National Bioethics      Advisory Commission acknowledged in its 1997 report Cloning      Human Beings, ``any effort in humans to transfer a somatic      cell nucleus into an enucleated egg involves the creation of      an embryo, with the apparent potential to be implanted in      utero and developed to term.'' [emphasis added]       Earlier this month, Michael West, the head of the major      biotech firm Advanced Cell Technology (ACT) of Worcester,      Massachusetts, told journalists that the firm intends to      start cloning ``soon.'' As recently as the December 27, 2000      issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association,      three members of the ACT team, including Dr. West, along with      bioethicist Ronald Green of Dartmouth University and two      other bioethicists, co-authored a major paper on human      cloning that freely acknowledged that the method creates      human embryos. They wrote, ``. . . because therapeutic      cloning requires the creation and disaggregation ex utero of      blastocyst stage embryos, this technique raises complex      ethical questions,'' [emphasis added]       The attached factsheet includes numerous such admissions      from diverse researchers and public bodies. Thus, it is past      time for Mr. Greenwood and Mr. Deutsch to drop their      disinformation campaign and engage in an honest debate over      whether human embryo farms should be allowed in this country.      If you oppose the establishment of human embryo farms, vote      no on the Greenwood-Deutsch substitute.           Sincerely,                                                  Douglas Johnson,     Legislative Director.                                  ____Scientists Say ``Therapeutic Cloning'' Creates a Human Embryo--July 26,                                   2001       President Clinton's National Bioethics Advisory Commission,      in its 1997 report Cloning Human Beings, explicitly stated:       ``The Commission began its discussions fully recognizing      that any effort in humans to transfer a somatic cell nucleus      into an enucleated egg involves the creation of an embryo,      with the apparent potential to be implanted in utero and      developed to term.''       The National Institutes of Health Human Embryo Research      Panel also assumed in its September 27, 1994 Final Report,      that cloning results in embryos. In listing research      proposals that ``should not be funded for the foreseeable      future'' because of ``serious ethical concerns,'' the NIH      panel included cloning:       ``Such research includes: . . .  Studies designed to      transplant embryonic or adult nuclei into an enucleated egg,      including nuclear cloning, in order to duplicate a genome or      to increase the number of embryos with the same genotype,      with transfer.''       A group of scientists, ethicists, and biotechnology      executives advocating ``therapeutic cloning'' and use of      human embryos for research--Arthur Caplan of the University      of Pennsylvania, Lee Silver of Princeton University, Ronald      Green of Dartmouth University, and Michael West, Robert      Lanza, and Jose Cibelli of Advanced Cell Technology--     confirmed in the December 27, 2000 issue of the Journal of      the American Medical Association that a human embryo is      created and destroyed through ``therapeutic cloning'':       ``CRNT [cell replacement through nuclear transfer, another      term for ``therapeutic cloning''] requires the deliberate      creation and disaggregation of a human embryo.''       ``. . .  because therapeutic cloning requires the creation      and disaggregation ex utero of blastocyst stage embryos, this      technique raises complex ethical questions.''       On September 7, 2000, the European Parliament adopted a      resolution on human cloning. The Parliament's press release      defined and commented on ``therapeutic cloning'':       ``. . .  `Therapeutic cloning,' which involves the creation      of human embryos purely for research purposes, poses an      ethical dilemma and crosses a boundary in research norms.''       Lee M. Silver, professor of molecular biology and      evolutionary biology at Princeton University, argues in his      1997 book, Remarking Eden: Cloning and Beyond in a Brave New      World:       ``Yet there is nothing synthetic about the cells used in      cloning. . . . The newly created embryo can only develop      inside the womb of a woman in the same way that all embryos      and fetuses develop. Cloned children will be full-fledged      human beings, indistinguishable in biological terms from all      other members of the species.''       The President and CEO of the biotechnology firm that      recently announced its intentions to clone human embryos for      research purposes, Michael D. West, Ph.D. of Advanced Cell      Technology, testified before a Senate Appropriations      Subcommittee on December 2, 1998:       ``In this . . .  procedure, body cells from a patient would      be fused with an egg cell that has had its nucleus (including      the nuclear DNA) removed. This would theoretically allow the      production of a blastocyst-staged embryo genetically      identical to the patient . . . .''       Dr. Ian Wilmut of PPL Technologies, leader of the team that      cloned Dolly the sheep, describes in the Spring 1998 issue of      Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics how embryos are used      in the process now referred to as ``therapeutic cloning'':       ``One potential use for this technique would be to take      cells--skin cells, for example--from a human patient who had      a genetic disease. . . . You take this and get them back to      the beginning of their life by nuclear transfer into an      oocyte to produce a new embryo. From that new embryo, you      would be able to obtain relatively simple, undifferentiated      cells, which would retain the ability to colonize the tissues      of the patient.''       As documented in the American Medical News, February 23,      1998, University of Colorado human embryologist Jonathan Van      Blerkom expressed disbelief that some deny that human cloning      produces an embryo, commenting: ``If it's not an embryo, what      is it?''  Mr. Speaker, I commend to the House the following article written by Mr. Douglas Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee.                   The Amazing Vanishing Embryo Trick       It was revealed last week that Advanced Cell Technology      (ACT) of Worcester, Massachusetts, a prominent privately      owned biotechnology firm, has a plan to mass-produce human      embryos. The firm also has a plan to render those same      embryos nonexistent.       ACT is attempting to develop a technique to produce      ``cloned human entities,'' who would then be killed in order      to harvest their stem cells, as first reported by Washington      Post science writer Rick Weiss (July 13).       As Associated Press biotechnology writer Paul Elias      explained in a July 13 report, ``Many scientists consider the      [anticipated] results of Advanced Cell's technique to be      human embryos, since theoretically, they could be implanted      into a womb and grown into a fetus. [ACT chief executive      Michael] West himself has used the term `embryo.'''       But it looks like West and his colleagues will not be      saying ``embryo'' in the future. ACT's executives are smart      people who anticipated that many outsiders would see their      embryo-farm project as an ethnical nightmare. So ACT      assembled a special task force of scientists and      ``ethicists'' to develop linguistic stealth devices, with      which they hope to slip under the public's moral radar.       As Weiss reported it, ``Before starting, the company      created an independent ethics board with nationally      recognized scientists and ethicists. . . . The group has      debated at length whether there needs to be a new term      developed for the embryo-like entity created by cloning. Some      believe that since it is not produced by fertilization and is      not going to be allowed to develop into a fetus, it would be      useful to call the cells something less inflammatory than an      embryo.''       ``Embryo'' is merely a technical term for a human being at      the earliest stages of development. Until now, even the most      rabid defenders of abortion on demand had not objected to the      term ``embryo'' as being `'inflammatory.'' But apparently      ACT's experts have concluded that before the corporation      actually begins to mass-produce human embryos in order to      kill them, it would be prudent to erect a shield of biobabble      euphemisms.       Thus, ``These are not embryos,'' the chair of the ACT      ethics advisory board, Dartmouth University religion      professor Ronald Green, told the AP. ``They are not the      result of fertilization and there is no intent to implant      these in women and grow them.''       Further details on the ACT linguistic-engineering project      were provided in an essay by Weiss in the July 15 Washington      Post. It disclosed that one member of the ethics panel,      Harvard professor Ann Kieffling, favors dubbing the cloned      embryo as an ``ovasome,'' which is a blending of words for      ``egg'' and ``body.'' But Michael West currently likes      ``nuclear transfer-derived blastocyst.''       Green revealed his own favorite in the New York Times for      July 13. ``I'm tending personally to steer toward the term      `activated egg,' '' he told reporter Sheryl Gay Stolberg.       In my mind's eye, I imagine Green at ACT corporate      headquarters, somewhere in the marketing department, stroking      his beard and peering through a one-way window into a room in      which a scientifically selected focus group of non-     bioethicist citizens have been assembled to test-market      ``ovasome,'' ``activated egg,'' ``nuclear transfer-derived      blastocyst,'' and other freshly minted euphemisms.       But setting that image aside, Green's statement to the AP      has me seriously confused. He said that the anticipated      cloned entities are ``not embryos'' because (1) ``they are      not the result of fertilization,'' and (2) ``there is no      intent to implant these in women.''       Let's consider the ``intent'' criteria first. Green seems      to suggest that a living and developing embryonic being, who      is genetically a member of the species homo sapiens, can      somehow be transformed into something else on the basis of      the ``intent'' of those who conceived him or her. This seems      more akin to magical thinking than to science.       If ``intent'' is what determines the clone's intrinsic      nature, then what if a human clone is created by someone who      actually does have ``intent'' to implant him or her in a      womb? In that case, would Green consider that particular      clone to be a ``embryo'' from the beginning? If so, an ACT      scientist hypothetically could create two cloned individuals      at the same time, with intent to destroy one and intent to      implant the other, but only the latter would be a ``human      embryo'' in Green's eyes.       Or--since ``intent'' may be uncertain, or could change--     does the magical transformation into an ``embryo'' occur if      and when the embryonic entity actually is implanted in a      womb?       It seems, however, that Green may not regard the clone to      be a human embryo even after implantation in a womb, because      the in-utero clone--although he or she would appear to the      layman to be an unborn human child--would still bear the      burden of not being ``the result of fertilization.'' Perhaps      Green would prefer to refer to such an unborn-baby-like      entity as an ``extrapolated activated egg.''       But what if that clone is actually carried to term and      born? Would Green then consider him or her to be a ``human      being''? Could be, but I fear that the professor's logic      might lead him to perceive a need for a new term for any      baby-like entities and grown-up-people-like entities who were      not ``the result of fertilization.''       How about calling them ``activites'' (pronounced ``AC-tiv-     ites'')? That would link ``activated egg'' with ``vita,''      which is Latin for ``life,'' and it even smuggles in the ACT      corporate acronym, I think I'm getting the hang of this.       Green is a liberal-minded fellow, so I'll bet he would      allow such activated human-like entities to vote, obtain      Ph.D.s, and maybe even be awarded tenure. But perhaps they      would be required to sign their letters ``Ph.D. (act.),'' so      that they would not be confused with other tenured entities,      such as Professor Green, who are fully fertilized.
