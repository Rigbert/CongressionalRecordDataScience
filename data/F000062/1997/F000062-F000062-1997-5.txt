 President, a California company has embarked on an effort that I believe demonstrates how entrepreneurship and public service can go hand in hand.  The Recovery Network is a new nationwide cable television program dedicated to helping people recover from the devastating disease of addiction. This Santa Monica-based network is the first of its kind and the only broadcast network in the world devoted entirely to substance abuse recovery and prevention.  It is estimated that more than 130 million Americans suffer from or are affected by alcoholism, drug abuse, eating disorders, depression, gambling and other addictions. The Recovery Network offers a lifeline of help to millions of those in need offering group recovery sessions, information on 12-step recovery programs, a 24-hour 800-number help line, discussion shows designed for children of alcoholics and parents with drug abuse problems, and information shows on the pharmacological effects of alcohol and other addictive substances. Recovery Network serves not only those in need of help, but also the friends, families, teachers, and professionals seeking guidance and tools to effect change.  Another important part of the Recovery Network is the localized programming effort. ``Neighborhood Recovery'' enables local community groups to offer their services through cable programming. Organizations like Californians for Drug-Free Youth, and the Miami Coalition for a Safe and Drug-Free Community can reach out to people in their specific area offering information on local meetings and other resources.  I believe this type of public service programming is exactly what Congress envisioned when it passed the Cable Communications Act in 1984, ``* * * to provide the widest possible diversity of information sources and service to the public'' and ``* * * assure that cable systems are responsive to the needs and interest of the local community.''  Community cable became a permanent fixture on the American landscape in 1948. Its purpose was to service remote communities with a master antenna providing a clear television broadcast signal. Three years later, 70 cable systems services 14,000 homes nationally. Since then, cable television has become a vital full-service link to citizens in every city and town in the United States, serving more than 67 million households nationwide.  People suffering from alcohol and drug addiction have found the Recovery Network there to help when they were most in need:  One young couple from Ohio who was traveling and struggling to maintain their sobriety early in recovery happened upon the Recovery Network on their hotel television. They said ``* * * we turned you on unknowingly, and it was like an AA meeting right in our hotel room. It really helped us refocus on what is important, and that is AA and staying sober.''  An Indiana viewer wrote ``I just want to say thank you for the programs and the light at the end of the tunnel that they showed me.''  A Michigan man wrote ``Thank you for making such a big difference in my life.''  A California woman wrote ``When I can't make a meeting, I know you're there for me.''  Recovery Network has become a leader in delivering effective programming which provides solutions to these problems in the privacy of the home and in offering positive lifestyle choices as an alternative.  The Recovery Network is supported by every major drug abuse prevention and recovery organization in the Nation, including the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, the National Drug Prevention League, National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors and the National Parents Resource Institute for Drug Education.  Mr. President, I am proud that the Recovery Network is a product of the State of California and I wish them much success in their endeavor.                          ____________________
