 President, on another matter, we will vote on the nominations of three more talented individuals today whom the President has asked to serve as Federal district judges: Karen Scholer for the Northern District of Texas, Tilman Self for the Middle District of Georgia, and Terry Doughty for the Western District of Louisiana. These are three excellent nominees, and I encourage all of our colleagues to vote in support of each of them.                          ____________________
