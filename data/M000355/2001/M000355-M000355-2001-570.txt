(Paragraph 5(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules.)       3. Written notices of committee meetings will normally be      sent by the committee's staff director to all members of the      committee at least a week in advance. In addition, the      committee staff will telephone reminders of committee      meetings to all members of the committee or to the      appropriate staff assistants in their offices.       4. A copy of the committee's intended agenda enumerating      separate items of legislative business and committee business      will normally be sent to all members of the committee by the      staff director at least 1 day in advance of all meetings.      This does not preclude any member of the committee from      raising appropriate non-agenda topics.       5. Any witness who is to appear before the committee in any      hearing shall file with the clerk of the committee at least 3      business days before the date of his or her appearance, a      written statement of his or her proposed testimony and an      executive summary thereof, in such form as the chairman may      direct, unless the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member      waive such requirement for good cause.

Pursuant to paragraph 7(a)(1) of rule XXVI of the      Standing Rules, one-third of the members of the committee      shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business,      including action on amendments to measures prior to voting to      report the measure to the Senate.       3. Pursuant to paragraph 7(a)(2) of rule XXVI of the      Standing Rules, 2 members of the committee shall constitute a      quorum for the purpose of taking testimony under oath and 1      member of the committee shall constitute a quorum for the      purpose of taking testimony not under oath; provided,      however, that in either instance, once a quorum is      established, any one member can continue to take such      testimony.       4. Under no circumstances may proxies be considered for the      establishment of a quorum.                           TITLE III--VOTING       1. Voting in the committee on any issue will normally be by      voice vote.       2. If a third of the members present so demand, a record      vote will be taken on any question by roll call.       3. The results of roll call votes taken in any meeting upon      any measure, or any amendment thereto, shall be stated in the      committee report on that measure unless previously announced      by the committee, and such report or announcement shall      include a tabulation of the votes cast in favor of and the      votes cast in opposition to each such measure and amendment      by each member of the committee. (Paragraph 7(b) and (c) of      rule XXVI of the Standing Rules.)       4. Proxy voting shall be allowed on all measures and      matters before the committee. However, the vote of the      committee to report a measure or matter shall require the      concurrence of a majority of the members of the committee who      are physically present at the time of the vote. Proxies will      be allowed in such cases solely for the purpose of recording      a member's position on the question and then only in those      instances when the absentee committee member has been      informed of the question and has affirmatively requested that      he be recorded. (Paragraph 7(a)(3) of rule XXVI of the      Standing Rules.)        TITLE IV--DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY TO COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN       1. The Chairman is authorized to sign himself or by      delegation all necessary vouchers and routine papers for      which the committee's approval is required and to decide in      the committee's behalf all routine business.       2. The Chairman is authorized to engage commercial      reporters for the preparation of transcripts of committee      meetings and hearings.       3.
