 President, we all have an opportunity today to show support for our men and women in uniform in faraway places such as Iraq.  The bill before us is the Armed Services Tax Fairness Act. It is a bipartisan product. The bill represents the Senate's position pretty much as it was last year when this bill was brought up in the Senate. The revenue loss of the military tax relief package is offset with a crackdown on tax-motivated expatriates. I ask my colleagues to please show their support for our troops and support the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act.  I yield the floor.
