Speaker, as we celebrate the birth of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and reflect on his life and work, we are reminded of the challenges that democracy poses to us and the delicacy of liberty. Dr. King's life and, unfortunately, his vicious murder, remind us that we must continually work and, if necessary, fight to secure and protect our freedoms. Dr. King, in his courage to act, his willingness to meet challenges, and hisability to achieve, embodied all that is good and true in that battle for liberty.  The spirit of Dr. King lives on in many of the citizens in communities throughout our nation. It lives on in the people whose actions reflect the spirit of dedication and achievement that will help move our country into the future. In particular, several distinguished individuals from Indiana's First Congressional District will be recognized during the 20th Annual Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Breakfast on Monday, January 18, 1999, at the Gary Genesis Center in Gary, Indiana. In the past year, these individuals have, in their own ways, acted with courage, met challenges, and used their abilities to reach goals and enhance their communities.  Former Gary City Councilman Roosevelt Haywood will be honored with the 1999 ``Marcher's Award'' for his contributions to the struggle for equality of civil rights. As a leader of the Fair Share Organization, he worked diligently in his fight for the civil rights of all minorities. In addition, Mr. Clifford Minton will receive the prestigious 1999 Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. ``Drum Major Award'' for his outstanding contributions to fighting segregation. Clifford was one of the founders of the Frontiers International Civic Club and is the former Director of the Urban League of Northwest Indiana. Both Roosevelt Haywood and Clifford Minton should be applauded for their civil rights efforts in Northwest Indiana.  I would also like to recognize several Gary Tolleston Junior High School students: Tynese Anderson; Kenneth Bonner; Breone Dupre; LaKisha Girder; LeYona Greer; Katina Haaland-Ramer; Floyd Hobson; Leah Johnson; Ayashia Muhammad; Brooklyn Rogers; Brannon Smith; Mason Smith; Whitney Sullivan; Sheena Tinner; Phyllis Walker; and Courtney Williams. These students are members of the Tolleston Junior High School Spell Bowl Team, which won its fifth consecutive State Spell Bowl Championship. The team's success is also a credit to the outstanding ability and leadership of its teachers. In particular, Margaret Hymes and Janice Williams should be commended for the devotion they have demonstrated as coaches for the Tolleston Junior High Spell Bowl Team. Additionally, Tolleston Principal Lucille Upshaw and Dr. Mary Guinn, Gary Superintendent of Schools, should be recognized for their support. The accomplishments of these outstanding individuals are a reflection of their hard work and dedication to scholarship. Their scholastic effort and rigorous approach to learning have made them the best in the state. They have also brought pride to themselves, their families, their schools and their communities.  Additionally, I would like to take this opportunity to commend Miss Andrea Ledbetter of Gary, Indiana. She has been selected for the People to People Student Ambassador Program as part of the delegation going to New Zealand. The roots of the Student Ambassador Program reach back to 1956, when U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower founded People to People. He believed that individuals reaching out in friendship to citizens of other countries could contribute significantly to world peace. This is an excellent opportunity for Andrea to experience unparalleled opportunities for personal growth through an enriching program of educational and cultural interaction in another country.  Though very different in nature, the achievements of all these individuals reflect many of the same attributes that Dr. King possessed, as well as the values he advocated. Like Dr. King, these individuals saw challenges and rose to the occasion. They set goals and worked to achieve them. Mr. Speaker, I urge you and my other colleagues to join me in commending their initiative, determination and dedication.                          ____________________
