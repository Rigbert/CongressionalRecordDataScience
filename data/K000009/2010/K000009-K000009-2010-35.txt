We've learned that the Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice are looking into Goldman Sachs, but there is more you should know.  Today, it was revealed that this privileged firm also wholly owned a mortgage servicing company back from 2007. So it claims it had no knowledge of the housing meltdown, but in fact, it owned a loan servicing company.  Back in 2007, Goldman Sachs scooped up Litton Loan Servicing in Houston, Texas. Litton specialized in collecting money from borrowers in California and Florida. Goldman now services around 320,000 loans worth around $50 billion according to the Financial Times.  Litton does not seem to be quite on the up-and-up. In fact, it was just recently forced to settle a class-action lawsuit in Los Angeles for over half a million dollars, and the Financial Times reports that the Better BusinessBureau has listed almost 800 complaints on Litton. Worse, Litton has only put up about 29 percent of their loans into permanent modifications, leaving the rest of the consumers who tried to get one trying to find money to make up the difference they immediately owe Litton, and oh, of course, then they will owe the accrued late fees.  Goldman Sachs says little about this, of course. This is business as usual for them, but bad business as usual it appears.  However, the customers of Litton are not the only ones receiving poor services from Goldman Sachs. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission created by Congress is getting similar treatment. Despite saying that they will cooperate fully, Goldman Sachs is not cooperating fully with the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. In fact, a subpoena had to be issued last week to get documents from Goldman Sachs.  The New York Times quotes the chairman of the commission, Mr. Phil Angelides of California, as saying the following: ``Goldman Sachs has not, in our view, been cooperative with our requests for information or forthcoming with respect to documents, information, or interviews.''  Should that surprise any of us? It certainly shows that Goldman Sachs does not respect the law, nor the Congress, nor the executive branch, nor the American citizens, whose hard-earned dollars have poured into Goldman leading it to record profits, huge bonuses, and no results for ordinary people.  Worse, it makes one wonder what Goldman Sachs has to hide. Otherwise, why send irrelevant information to the commission and withhold other information? Yet Goldman continues to drag its feet in responding, and the commission had to subpoena.  Goldman Sachs could and should do better. They could lead Wall Street in corporate citizenship. We now know that Goldman Sachs could easily reduce the principal on every loan at Litton, write off all the late fees, and give 320,000 citizens some relief from the housing crisis that Goldman, along with the rest of Wall Street's biggest investment banks--or I should say speculators--had in creating.  How much do you want to bet that they won't? Anyone want to hedge a bet with a credit default swap or a synthetic collateralized debt obligation? I bet Goldman would be willing to sell you one, but you know, what they're really doing is they're trying to send their lobbyists to try to meet with members of the commission that Mr. Angelides heads.  The New York Times reports that, ``Lobbyists representing Goldman in Washington tried to arrange one-on-one meetings with a handful of those commissioners, including Mr. Angelides, but he declined to meet with them.''  Congratulations, Mr. Angelides. Guess what, they do the same thing to the Members of Congress. They wait for us in the hallways. They get on the elevators with us if we refuse to meet with them. They pay their lobbyists here lots of money.  So you keep doing what you're doing, Mr. Angelides. You keep digging. I'm glad you declined to meet with them.  And you know, according to the people who spoke with the New York Times, many of them said they spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the commission's inner workings. So I'm glad to see that there are some Americans out there who are trying to get to the truth, trying to get to the heart of the matter, trying to get justice for the American people in the housing market where the deck is so strongly stacked against ordinary citizens who should hold one piece of paper they call their mortgage, and yet the note for that is locked up somewhere upstream, held on Wall Street or one of its subsidiaries. And most Americans who are getting thrown out of their houses across this country and being forcibly removed don't even have enough legal advice to know that they should be asking the judge to produce the original note in those proceedings, not a Xeroxed copy.  The American people: get yourself legal assistance back home from your fair housing agencies, your counseling agencies. You have a right to your own mortgage, and no one should take it away from you if you have a leg to stand on. And the judge should be on your side if you ask for that original note.                      [From FT.com, June 16, 2010]                U.S Consumers Rage Against Goldman Unit               (By Suzanne Kapner and Francesco Guerrera)       As ever-darker clouds have gathered over Goldman Sachs in      recent months, its executives have relied on a consistent      line of defence.       As regulators, congressional investigators and activist      shareholders have accused Wall Street's most successful      investment bank of putting its interests ahead of those of      its clients, Goldman's response has been: we deal with      sophisticated investors who ought to know how to look after      themselves, not powerless individuals.       ``We don't have banking branches . . . we provide very few      mortgages and don't issue credit cards or loans to      consumers,'' is how Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman's chief      executive, summarised the bank's modus operandi in a recent      appearance before a U.S. Senate subcommittee.       Yet, in one small corner of its domain, Goldman interacts      directly with ordinary Americans. Through its wholly owned      subsidiary Litton Loan Servicing, which is facing a wave of      complaints from consumers, Goldman collects payments on      320,000 loans, mainly in California and Florida, with an      unpaid principal balance of $50bn.       When Goldman acquired Litton in December 2007 for $430m,      the deal attracted little attention. Compared with Goldman's      $45bn in annual revenue, Litton is tiny. Goldman says Litton      services half of 1 per cent of U.S. mortgages.       The high-risk mortgages serviced by Litton were like the      many loans Goldman--and its rivals--packaged into complex      securities that plunged in value once the housing bubble      burst, leading to huge losses among investors.       Goldman's knowledge of the perilous state of the U.S.      property market, and its alleged reluctance to share it with      investors, is at the centre of civil fraud charges filed by      the Securities and Exchange Commission--which the bank      denies--and were the focus of an 11-hour grilling of Goldman      executives by Senate investigators in April.       Founded in 1988 by Larry Litton Sr in Houston after the      Texas real estate bust, Litton developed expertise in      collecting payments on high-risk mortgages that were near      default. The company was purchased in 1996 by Credit-Based      Asset Servicing and Securitization (C-Bass), which bought      troubled loans from banks and used Litton to restructure      them.       Because of its focus on distressed borrowers, Litton was      one of the first companies to experiment with reducing      interest payments for customers who had fallen behind to keep      them from losing their homes. Such ``loan modifications''      have become common practice.       Litton's focus on modifying loans, coupled with its      relationship with C-Bass, gave it an edge over rival      servicers.       Because C-Bass bought bonds that were backed by pools of      mortgages, Litton had the right to modify those loans once      they soured.       According to Moody's Investors Service, Litton has retained      the right to modify loans in 95 percent of the securities      backed by loans it services. In contrast, other servicers      have been blocked and even sued by investors, who claim loan      modifications violate the original contract terms.       ``Litton has been more aggressive than some of the other      servicers,'' said Alan White, an assistant professor at the      Valparaiso University School of Law. ``It's part of their      culture.''       That approach has at times incurred the wrath of consumers.      Concerned about rising complaints against the company, the      Houston chapter of the Better Business Bureau conducted an      investigation in 2005. ``They were arrogant,'' said Dan      Parsons, president of the Houston chapter. ``It was all about      how much money they could make.''       The bureau voted to revoke the company's membership but      Litton resigned before it could act.       Larry Litton Jr, current chief executive of the servicer,      told the Financial Times the resignation was prompted by a      failure of the bureau to fully grasp its business strategy.       He added that Litton had long been an advocate of      restructuring consumer debt.       ``We do it because it's a good financial decision for      investors, but also because it's a good outcome for      consumers,'' Mr Litton said.       When C-Bass ran into financial trouble in 2007, Goldman      snapped up Litton. Goldman said it has extensive procedures      in place to ensure that information from Litton is not used      inappropriately.       A person familiar with the situation said Mr Litton did not      report directly to Mr Blankfein or Goldman's senior      management, but interacted with lower-level mortgage      executives.       After buying Litton, Goldman took pains to operate the      company separately from its trading and advisory business and      does not use Goldman branding on Litton's marketing      materials. Such distance is in keeping with Goldman's desire      to be seen as a Wall Street firm that deals with high finance      only.       Many Litton customers did not realise the mortgage servicer      was owned by Goldman. Marla Vasquez, a disgruntled customer      in     California, said she learnt about the SEC investigation from      a radio broadcast. ``It surprised me Goldman owns a company      like this,'' she said.                                  ____                      [From FT.com, June 16, 2010]                   Subprime Consumers Hit at Goldman                          (By Suzanne Kapner)       Goldman Sachs is facing a wave of complaints from consumers      over the business practices of its mortgage servicing unit, a      subsidiary that collects payments on hundreds of thousands of      loans worth tens of billions of dollars.       Goldman bought Litton Loan Servicing--a Houston, Texas,      specialist in collecting money from high-risk borrowers--in      December 2007, a year after the bank decided to reduce its      exposure to the U.S. housing market.       The deal gave Goldman a new way to earn fees from subprime      borrowers and provided it with a street-level view of      conditions in the U.S. housing market as the financial crisis      deepened.       It also put the Wall Street bank in the unusual position of      facing hundreds of complaints from mainstream consumers, who      allege that Litton unfairly charged them money. Without      admitting wrongdoing, Litton agreed last year to pay $532,000      to settle a class-action lawsuit in Los Angeles, accusing it      of charging late fees during a 60-day grace period on loans      it acquired from other servicers.       ``Litton saw a great opportunity to make a lot of money by      collecting servicing fees on troubled loans,'' said Dan      Parsons, president of the Houston chapter of the Better      Business Bureau, a non-profit group that promotes responsible      business practices. ``But when Litton takes over a loan, the      borrower tends to be worse off.''       Larry Litton Jr, chief executive of the Goldman unit,      declined to comment on specific complaints and said any fees      resulted from normal procedures. He added that it was      ``inevitable'' Litton would face complaints as it deals      mainly with distressed borrowers. ``Do I wish complaint      levels were lower?'' he said. ``Absolutely, we take      complaints very seriously.''       The Better Business Bureau lists nearly 800 complaints in      the U.S. against Litton during the past three years, more      than have been filed against most similar-sized servicers. In      Houston, only three companies--Comcast, Telecheck and      Continental Airlines--received more complaints Mr Parsons      said.       Consumer Affairs, a website that tracks consumer problems,      said it had received 390 complaints against Litton in the      past year, a 60 percent rise over the prior 12 months, and      more than triple the number logged against some similar-sized      competitors. Many complaints against Litton come from      consumers who say they entered into ``trial'' mortgage      modification programmes that reduced their payments, only to      find out later that they had been denied a permanent      modification and owed more money than they would have if they      had not entered the programme.       Litton's loan modification application states borrowers are      liable for past due amounts, including unpaid interest, if      they are denied a permanent modification. Late fees are      supposed to be waived if permanent modifications are granted.      According to government data through April, Litton's rate for      converting loans from trial to permanent modifications was 29      percent, compared with rates of more than 80 percent for some      competitors.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, June 7, 2010]           Financial Panel Issues a Subpoena to Goldman Sachs                (By Sewell Chan and Gretchen Morgenson)       Washington.--The commission investigating the causes of the      financial crisis said on Monday that it had subpoenaed      Goldman Sachs and harshly accused the investment bank of      trying to delay and disrupt its inquiry.       ``Goldman Sachs has not, in our view, been cooperative with      our requests for information, or forthcoming with respect to      documents, information or interviews,'' Phil Angelides, the      chairman of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, told      reporters on a conference call.       The deputy chairman, Bill Thomas, accused Goldman of      stonewalling, and said, ``They may have more to cover up than      either we thought or than they told us.''       But even as Goldman appeared to be uncooperative, it tried      over the last month to set up personal meetings with members      of the commission, two people briefed on the discussions      said.       Lobbyists representing Goldman in Washington tried to      arrange one-on-one meetings with a handful of commissioners,      including Mr. Angelides, but he declined to meet with them,      according to the people, who spoke on the condition of      anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the      commission's inner workings.       Mr. Angelides and Mr. Thomas both said that Goldman had      inundated the panel with data--about five terabytes,      equivalent to several billion printed pages--and dragged its      feet on answering detailed questions about derivatives,      securitization and other business activities.       In particular, the commission sought records on      collateralized debt obligations based on mortgage-backed      securities, and the names of Goldman's customers in      transactions of derivatives. In a chronology it provided, the      commission also indicated that it was interested in Goldman's      dealings with the American International Group, the insurance      giant that collapsed in 2008, and in the bank's so-called      Abacus transactions, which are at the heart of a civil fraud      suit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.       The commission's unusual public criticism--it has issued 12      subpoenas, none accompanied by stinging accusations of      obstruction--underscored the anger in Washington at the      outsize profits and influence of Goldman, which had emerged      nearly unscathed from the financial crisis. It also reflected      the fallout from Goldman's unyielding strategy of standing      its ground in the face of inquiries and attacks.       A spokesman for Goldman, Michael DuVally, said, ``We have      been and continue to be committed to providing the F.C.I.C.      with the information they have requested.''       The lashing by the commission further complicated Goldman's      public image. In April, the bank was accused of securities      fraud in a civil suit filed by the S.E.C., which contended      that it created and sold a mortgage investment that was      secretly devised to fail.       That investment and others like it were the subject of a      Senate investigation that also exposed Goldman to withering      criticism. And federal prosecutors in Manhattan have begun      looking into the mortgage practices of banks, including      Goldman.       The commission, created by Congress, is required to deliver      a report by December, but with only $8 million and some 50      employees to draw on, it has at times seemed outmatched by      the targets of its inquiries.       ``I suspect they're spending more on their lawyers than our      whole budget,'' Mr. Thomas conceded.       Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman's chairman and chief executive,      testified at the commission's first public hearing in      January, with the top bankers Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase,      John J. Mack of Morgan Stanley and Brian T. Moynihan of Bank      of America.       After the hearing, the commission sent written questions      for Mr. Blankfein and made requests for records in April and      May.       Mr. Thomas, a California Republican who served 28 years in      the House, said the requests to Goldman were ``not      inordinate'' compared with similar queries sent to a half-     dozen other banks. All of the other institutions complied, he      said.       In contrast, Mr. Thomas said, Goldman gave a ``basically      incomplete'' response, even as it deluged the commission with      so much irrelevant information that it amounted to      ``mischief-making'' that was both ``deliberate and      disruptive.''       Mr. Angelides, a former California treasurer and candidate      for governor, said, ``We did not ask them to pull up a dump      truck to our offices and dump a bunch of rubbish.'' He added,      ``This has been a very deliberate effort over time to run out      the clock.''       The two men also seemed to acknowledge that the sheer      volume of data was beyond the commission's capacity to      analyze. ``We should not be forced to play Where's Waldo? on      behalf of the American people,'' Mr. Angelides said. ``This      is not right.''       Mr. Thomas, turning to the proverb about looking for a      needle in a haystack, said, ``We expect them to provide us      with the needle.''       The two men said that after the subpoena was issued on      Friday, Goldman had moved to schedule interviews with several      executives, including Mr. Blankfein; David A. Viniar, the      chief financial officer; Gary D. Cohn, the president and      chief operating officer; and Craig W. Broderick, the chief      risk officer.       The 10-member commission was slow to get started. It      recently replaced its executive director, B. Thomas Greene,      with Wendy M. Edelberg, an economist on loan from the Federal      Reserve, who had been the research director. Mr. Greene, a      former chief assistant attorney general for California,      remains on the commission's staff as senior counsel.                          ____________________
