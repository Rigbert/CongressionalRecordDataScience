Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate the City of Niles, Michigan for the dedication of its downtown ``streetscape'' project. Over the past two years countless individuals tirelessly worked to bring this project to this remarkable pinnacle. With the addition of new streetlights, new planters, new patterned filled sidewalks, new drinking fountains, new benches, and new trash receptacles, the folks of Niles now have a tremendous downtown to be proud of. I had the great privilege of recently visiting the new streetscape and it is terrific.  The finishing of the ``streetscape'' couldn't have come at a more appropriate or meaningful time as families and friends come together to celebrate the holidays. Volunteers have diligently worked stringing garlands along fences, threading strands of lights into the trees, and placing ribbons and wreaths on the new historic streetlights, all in an effort to make the downtown ready for its holiday celebration.  Southwest Michigan and especially the folks of Niles truly have a magnificent historic downtown to cherish for years to come. On behalf of the Sixth District of Michigan I would like to especially pay tribute and give thanks to everyone who volunteered and worked on preserving and beatifying this great city.                          ____________________
