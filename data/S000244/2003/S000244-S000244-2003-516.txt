Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3140, ``The Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act of 2003,'' which provides contact lens wearers with important new rights. This bill ensures that unscrupulous eye doctors will no longer be able hold consumers' contact lens prescriptions hostage, forcing them to purchase lenses solely from their doctor's office. In addition, this legislation will make shopping for lenses simpler and cheaper.  Currently, eye doctors are only required to give patients their prescriptions for eyeglasses. Eyeglass wearers have had this right since 1978, when the Federal Trade Commission issued a regulation granting eyeglass wearers the right to automatically receive a copy of their prescription following an exam. Contact lenses were understandably not included in this regulation because, at the time, most contacts were hard lenses, which were custom-made to fit each patient. Today, most contact lenses are mass produced, soft lenses that do not require manipulation by eye doctors. As a result of this improvement, today's contact lens wearers should have the same right as eyeglass wearers to obtain their prescription, at no additional charge. That is why I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act.  Approximately 36 million Americans wear contact lenses. Each year, these Americans spend an estimated $3.5 billion on contact lenses. Providing consumers with an automatic right to their prescriptions will allow them to shop around for contact lenses based on price, service, and convenience. It is estimated that H.R. 3140 could save consumers approximately $350 million annually, thanks in large part to increased competition. Competition among contact lens companies will result in lower prices, a greater choice of lens providers, and more convenient ways to fill contact lens prescriptions.  H.R. 3140 is bipartisan legislation supported by both optometrists and retailers. I have been working on this issue for a number of years, and am pleased to ``see'' it pass the House in a bipartisan manner. I encourage the Senate to take up this bill and help contact lens wearers receive this right.                          ____________________
