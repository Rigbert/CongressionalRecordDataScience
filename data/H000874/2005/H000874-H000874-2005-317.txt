 Mr. DeLAY. I appreciate the gentleman yielding.  The bill that passed out of committee, by the way, would do nothing for New Orleans, nor would it do anything for the disaster relief in Alabama or Mississippi either.  What the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank) is referring to is a negotiation that has been ongoing to create, out of this building fund, at the GSEs an opportunity to change the bill and allow housing to be built in these devastated areas. That is the process around here. It is democracy when Members are negotiating a change to the bill; and in changing that bill in the way that has been suggested andsupported, obviously, by the gentlemen from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank) other Members ought to have the opportunity to look at this bill and negotiate a bill that would receive the same sort of ratio here on the floor, rather than having a contentious battle on the floor and writing the bill on the floor.  We try our best to write bills in committee, but when the bill changes from committee to the floor, negotiations are created, and we are in the process of those negotiations, and that is the way this process works. The gentleman from Massachusetts has been here a lot longer than me, and he understands that.
