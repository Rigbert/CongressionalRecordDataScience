President, this past Sunday marked the beginning of National Crime Victims' Rights Week. We set this week aside each year to focus attention on the needs and rights of crime victims. I am pleased to take this opportunity to introduce legislation with my good friend from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, and our cosponsors, Senators Feingold, Murray, Johnson, Schumer and Harkin. Our bill, the Crime Victims Assistance Act of 2001, represents the next step in our continuing efforts to afford dignity and recognition to victims of crime.  My involvement with crime victims began more than three decades ago when I served as State's Attorney in Chittenden County, VT, and witnessed first-hand the devastation of crime. I have worked ever since to ensure that the criminal justice system is one that respects the rights and dignity of victims of crime, rather than one that presents additional ordeals for those already victimized.  I am proud that Congress has been a significant part of the solution to provide victims with greater rights and assistance. Over the past two decades, Congress has passed several bills to this end. These bills have included: the Victims Witness Protection Act of 1982; the Victims of Crime Act of 1984; the Victims' Bill of Rights of 1990; the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990; the Violence Against Women Act of 1994; the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996; the Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997; the Victims with Disabilities Awareness Act of 1998;and the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000.  The legislation that we introduce today, the Crime Victims Assistance Act of 2001, builds upon this progress. It provides for comprehensive reform of the Federal law to establish enhanced rights and protections for victims of Federal crime. Among other things, our bill provides crime victims with the right to consult with the prosecution prior to detention hearings and the entry of plea agreements, and generally requires the courts to give greater consideration to the views and interests of the victim at all stages of the criminal justice process. Responding to concerns raised by victims of the Oklahoma City bombing, the bill provides standing for the prosecutor and the victim to assert the right of the victim to attend and observe the trial.  Assuring that victims are provided their statutorily guaranteed rights is a critical concern for all those involved in the administration of justice. Our bill would establish an administrative authority in the Department of Justice to receive and investigate victims' claims of unlawful or inappropriate action on the part of criminal justice and victims' service providers. Department of Justice employees who fail to comply with the law pertaining to the treatment of crime victims could face disciplinary sanctions, including suspension or termination of employment.  In addition to these improvements to the Federal system, the bill proposes several programs to help States provide better assistance for victims of State crimes. These programs would improve compliance with State victim's rights laws, promote the development of state-of-the-art notification systems to keep victims informed of case developments and important dates on a timely and efficient basis, and encourage further experimentation with the community-based restorative justice model in the juvenile court setting.  Finally, the Crime Victims Assistance Act would make several significant amendments to the Victims of Crime Act, VOCA, and improve the manner in which the Crime Victims Fund is managed and preserved. Most significantly, the bill would eliminate the cap on VOCA spending, which has prevented more than $700 million in Fund deposits from reaching victims and supporting essential services.  Congress has capped spending from the Fund for the last two fiscal years, and President Bush has proposed a third cap for fiscal year 2002. These limits on VOCA spending have created a growing sense of confusion and unease by many of those concerned about the future of the Fund.  We should not be imposing artificial caps on VOCA spending while substantial unmet needs continue to exist. The Crime Victims Assistance Act replaces the cap with a formulaic approach, which would ensure stability and protection of Fund assets, while allowing more money to go out to the States for victim compensation and assistance.  These are all matters that can be considered and enacted this year with a simple majority of both Houses of Congress. They need not overcome the delay and higher standards necessitated by proposing to amend the Constitution. They need not wait the hammering out of implementing legislation before making a difference in the lives of crime victims.  The Judiciary Committee has held several hearings over the last five years on a proposed constitutional amendment regarding crime victims. Unfortunately, the Committee has devoted not a minute to consideration of legislative initiatives like the Crime Victims Assistance Act, which Senator Kennedy and I first introduced in the 105th Congress, to assist crime victims and better protect their rights. Like many other deserving initiatives, it has taken a back seat to the constitutional amendment debate that continues.  I regret that we have not done more for victims this year, or during the last few years. I have on several occasions noted my concern that we not dissipate the progress we could be making by focusing exclusively on efforts to amend the Constitution. Regretfully, I must note that the pace of victims legislation has slowed noticeably and many opportunities for progress have been squandered. One notable exception was the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, which included a Leahy-Feinstein amendment dealing with support for victims of international terrorism. Senator Feinstein cares deeply about the rights of victims, and I am pleased that we could work together on some practical, pragmatic improvements to our federal crime victims' laws.  I look forward to continuing to work with the Administration, victims groups, prosecutors, judges and other interested parties on how we can most effectively enhance the rights of victims of crime. Congress and State legislatures have become more sensitive to crime victims rights over the past 20 years and we have a golden opportunity to make additional, significant progress this year to provide the greater voice and rights that crime victims deserve.  I would like to acknowledge several individuals and organizations that have been extremely helpful with regards to the legislation that we are introducing today: Dan Eddy, National Association of Crime Victim Compensation Boards; Steve Derene, Wisconsin Department of Justice Office of Crime Victims Services; Susan Howley, National Center for Victims of Crime; and John Stein, National Organization for Victim Assistance. I would also like to thank Kathryn M. Turman, the Acting Director for the Office for Victims of Crime, and Heather Cartwright and Carolyn Hightower of that office, for their work on this project.  While we have greatly improved our crime victims assistance programs and made advances in recognizing crime victims rights, we still have more to do. That is why it is my hope that Democrats and Republicans, supporters and opponents of a constitutional amendment on this issue, will join in advancing this important legislation through Congress. We can make a difference in the lives of crime victims right now, and I hope Congress will make it a top priority and pass the Crime Victims Assistance Act before the end of the year.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and the section-by-section analysis be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 783       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

The bill      would accomplish three major goals. First, it would provide      enhanced rights and protections for victims of federal      crimes. Second, it would assist victims of State crimes      through grant programs designed to promote compliance with      State victim's rights laws. Third, it would make several      significant amendments to the Victims of Crime Act and      improve the manner in which the Crime Victims Fund is managed      and preserved.              Title I--Victim Rights in the Federal System       Sec. 101. Right to consult concerning detention. Requires      the government to consult with victim prior to a detention      hearing to obtain information that can be presented to the      court on the issue of any threat the suspected offender may      pose to the victim.

Requires the court, prior to      entering judgment on a plea, to make inquiry concerning the      views of the victim on the issue of the plea.       Sec. 104. Enhanced participatory rights at trial. Provides      standing for the prosecutor and the victim to assert the      right of the victim to attend and observe the trial. Extends      the Victim Rights Clarification Act to apply to televised      proceedings. Amends the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act      of 1990 to strengthen the right of crime victims to be      present at court proceedings, including trials.       Sec. 105. Enhanced participatory rights at sentencing.      Requires the probation officer to include as part of the      presentence report any victim impact statement submitted by a      victim. Extends to all victims the right to make a statement      or present information in relation to the sentence.

Sec. 107. Right to notice concerning discharge from      psychiatric facility. Requires the government to provide the      victim the earliest possible notice of the discharge or      conditional discharge from a psychiatric facility of an      offender who was found not guilty by reason of insanity.       Sec. 108. Right to notice concerning executive clemency.      Requires the government to provide the victim the earliest      possible notice of the grant of executive clemency to the      offender. Requires the Attorney General to report to Congress      concerning executive clemency matters delegated for review or      investigation to the Attorney General.       Sec. 109. Procedures to promote compliance. Establishes an      administrative system for enforcing the rights of crime      victims in the federal system.                TITLE II--VICTIM ASSISTANCE INITIATIVES       Sec. 201. Pilot programs to enforce compliance with      victim's rights laws. Authorizes the establishment of pilot      programs in five States to establish and operate compliance      authorities to promote compliance and effective enforcement      of State laws regarding the rights of victims of crime.      Compliance authorities would receive and investigate      complaints relating to the provision or violation of a crime      victim's rights, and issue findings following such      investigations. Authorizes appropriations to make grants for      these pilot programs.       Sec. 202.

These positions are currently funded      with money from the Crime Victims Fund.               TITLE III--VICTIMS OF CRIME ACT AMENDMENTS       Sec. 301. Crime Victims Fund. Replaces the annual cap on      the Fund with a formula that ensures stability in the amounts      distributed to the States, while preserving the amounts      remaining in the Fund for use in future years. Discontinues      the practice of using Fund money to pay for victim assistance      positions in certain federal agencies; these positions would      now be funded through direct appropriations under section      204. Increases the portion of the Fund that shall be      available to OVC for discretionary victim assistance grants      and for assistance to victims of federal crime. Permits OVC      to retain a maximum of $50 million in an antiterrorism      emergency reserve that can be replenished with up to 5      percent of the amounts retained in the Fund after the annual      Fund distribution.       Sec. 302. Crime victim compensation. Increases from 40 to      60 percent the minimum threshold for the annual grant to      State crime victim compensation programs. Clarifies that a      payment of compensation to a victim shall not reduce the      amount of assistance available to that victim under other      government programs.       Sec. 303. Crime victim assistance. Authorizes States to      give VOCA funds to U.S. Attorney's Offices in jurisdictions      where the U.S. Attorney is the local prosecutor. Prohibits      State crime victim assistance programs that receive VOCA      grants from discriminating against victims because they      oppose the death penalty or disagree with the way the State      is prosecuting the criminal case. Authorizes OVC to make      grants to eligible crime victim assistance programs for      program evaluation and compliance efforts. Allows OVC to use      funds for fellowships and clinical internships and to carry      out training programs.       Sec. 304. Victims of Terrorism. Technical amendment to      section 2003 of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of      2000 (PL 106-386), which inadvertently reversed the existing      exclusion under VOCA of individuals eligible for other      federal compensation under the Omnibus Diplomatic Security      and Antiterrorism Act of 1986 (ODSA). The exclusion of      individuals eligible for compensation under ODSA should have      been applied to section 1404C of VOCA, which covers direct      compensation to victims of international terrorism, and not      to section 1404B, which covers assistance to victims of      terrorism.                                 ______                                       By
