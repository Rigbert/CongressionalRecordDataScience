President, I am joined today by Senators Burns, Dole, Pressler, and Murray in introducing a bill that is pro-business, pro-jobs and pro-privacy.  The Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1996 would enhance the global competitiveness of our high-technology industries, protect the high-paying good jobs in those industries and maximize the choices in encryption technology available for businesses and individuals to protect the privacy, confidentiality and security of their computer, telephone, and other wire and electronic communications.  The guiding principle for this bill can be summed up in one sentence: Encryption is good for American business and good business for Americans.  FBI Director Louis Freeh testified last week at a hearing on economic espionage and quoted Secretary of State Warren Christopher as saying that ``Our national security is inseparable from our economic security.'' I could not agree more. Yet, American businesses are suffering a double blow from our current encryption policies. First, American firms lose billions of dollars each year due to the theft of proprietary economic information, which could be better protected if strong encryption were more widely used. Second, government export restrictions tie the hands of American high-technology businesses by barring the export of strong encryption technology. The size of these combined losses makes encryption one of the critical issues facing American businesses today.  Moreover, the increasing use of and dependency on networked computers by Americans to obtain critical medical services, to conduct research, to be entertained, to go shopping and to communicate with friends and business associates, raises special concerns about the privacy and confidentiality of their computer transmissions. I have long been concerned about these issues, and have worked over the past decade to create a legal structure to foster privacy and security for our wire and electronic communications. Encryption technology provides an effective way to ensure that only the people we choose can read our communications.  A leading encryption expert, Matt Blaze, told me in a recent letter that our current regulations governing the use and export of encryption are having a ``deleterious effect on our country's ability to develop a reliable and trustworthy information infrastructure.'' It is time for Congress to take steps to put our national encryption policy on the right course.  The Encrypted Communications Privacy Act would accomplish three goals:  First, the bill encourages the use of encryption by legislatively confirming that Americans have the freedom to use and sell here in the United States any encryption technology that they feel is most appropriate to meet their privacy and security needs. The bill bars any government-mandated use of any particular encryption system, such as a key escrow encryption system.  Second, for those Americans who choose to use a key escrow encryption method, the bill establishes privacy standards for key holders and stringent procedures for how law enforcement can obtain access to decoding keys and decryption assistance. These standards would subject key holders to criminal and civil liability if they released the keys or divulged the identity and information about the user of the encryption system, without legal authorization. Commenting on these provisions, Bruce Schneir, who has literally written the textbook on encryption, said in a recent letter to me that the bill ``recognizes the special obligations of keyholders to be vigilant in safeguarding the information entrusted to them, without imposing hurtles on the use of cryptography.''  Finally, the bill loosens export restrictions on encryption products. Under the bill, it would be lawful for American companies to export high-technology products with encryption capabilities when comparable encryption capabilities are available from foreign suppliers, and generally available encryption software, including mass market products and encryption that is in the public domain. According to Mr. Schneir, the bill ``removes the strangle-hold that has encumbered the development of mass-market security solutions'' which are so vital to the development of our information infrastructure.  Senator Murray took a leading role in the last Congress on reforming our export restrictions on encryption, and I commend her for continuing to give this important issue her committed attention again in this Congress.  Current export restrictions allow the export of primarily weak encryption software programs. So weak, in fact, that a January 1996 report by an ad hoc group of world-renowned cryptographers and computer scientists estimated that it would take a pedestrian hacker a matter of hours to break and a foreign intelligence agency a matter of nanoseconds to break. No wonder that foreign buyers of encryption products are increasingly looking elsewhere for strong security. This hurts the competitiveness of our high-technology industry.  A recent report by the Computer Systems Policy Project, which is a group of major American computer companies estimated that U.S. companies stand to lose between $30 and $60 billion in revenues and over 200,000 of high-technology jobs by the year 2000 because U.S. companies are handicapped in the global market by outdated export restrictions.  Even the Commerce Department reported in January that U.S. export controls may have a ``negative effect on U.S. competitiveness'' and ``may discourage'' the use of strong encryption domestically since manufacturers want to make only one product for export and for use here.  Although American companies account for almost 75 percent of the global market for prepackaged software, the rest of the world is competing strongly in the market for encryption software. Shortsighted government policy is holding back American business. Almost 2 years ago, I chaired a hearing of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Technology and the Law on the administration's Clipper Chip key escrow encryption program. I heard testimony about 340 foreign encryption products that were available worldwide, 155 of them employing encryption in a strength that American firms were prohibited from exporting.  In 2 short years, those numbers have increased. According to a survey of cryptographic products conducted by Trusted Information System, as of December 1995, 497 foreign products from 28 countries were available with encryption security. Almost 200 of these foreign products used strong encryption that American companies are barred from selling abroad. This study draws the obvious conclusion that ``As a result, U.S. Government restrictions may be succeeding only in crippling a vital American industry's exporting ability.''  At the Clipper Chip hearing I chaired in 1994, I heard a number of reports about American companies losing business opportunities due to U.S. export restrictions. One data security company reported that despite its superior system, it had been unable to respond to requests from NATO and foreign telecommunications companies because it cannot export the encryption they demanded. This cost this single American company millions in foregone business. Another major computer company lost two sales in Western Europe in a single year totaling about $80 million because the file and data encryption in the integrated system they offered was not exportable.  Our current export restrictions on encryption technology are fencing off the global marketplace and hurting the competitiveness of this part of our high-technology industries. While national and domestic security concerns must weigh heavily, we need to do a better job of balancing these concerns with American business' need for encryption and the economic opportunities for our high-technology industries that encryption technology provides.  American businesses are not only suffering lost sales because of our current export restrictions, but are also suffering staggering losses due to economic espionage. FBI Director Freeh testified that the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy puts the amount of that loss at $100 billion per year. At a hearing last week on economic espionage, we heard from one witness who had to close down his software company, with a loss of 25 jobs, after China bribed an employee to steal the source code for the company's software.  We have bills pending before Congress to enact new criminal laws to punish people who steal trade secrets or other proprietary information and who break into computers to steal sensitive information. But new criminal laws are not the whole answer. Criminal laws often only come into play too late, after the theft has occurred or the injury inflicted.  We must encourage American firms to take preventive measures to protect their vital economic information. That is where encryption comes in. Just as we have security systems to lock up our offices and file drawers, we need strong encryption systems to protect the security and confidentiality of business information.  The Computer Systems Policy Project estimates that, without strong encryption, financial losses by the year 2000 from breaches of computer security systems to be from $40 to $80 billion. Unfortunately, some of these losses are already occurring. One U.S.-based manufacturer is quoted in the Project's report, saying:       We had a multi-year, multi-billion dollar contract stolen      off our P.C. (while bidding in a foreign country). Had it      been encrypted, [the foreign competitor] could not have used      it in the bidding time frame.  New technologies present enormous opportunities for Americans, but we must strive to safeguard our privacy if these technologies are to prosper in this information age. Otherwise, in the service of law enforcement and intelligence needs, we will dampen any enthusiasm Americans may have for taking advantage of the new technologies.  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important matter, and ask unanimous consent that the bill, a summary of the bill, and three letters of support from Matt Blaze, Bruce Schneir, and Business Software Alliance, be included in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1587       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(b) Technical Amendment.--The table of chapters for part I      of title 18, United States Code, is amended by inserting      after the item relating to chapter 33, the following new      item:``122. Encrypted wire and electronic communications.........2801''.....     SEC. 6. INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES.       (a) Construction.--Nothing in this Act or the amendments      made by this Act constitutes authority for the conduct of any      intelligence activity.       (b) Certain Conduct.--Nothing in this Act or the amendments      made by this Act shall affect the conduct, by officers or      employees of the United States Government in accordance with      other applicable Federal law, under procedures approved by      the Attorney General, or activities intended to--       (1) intercept encrypted or other official communications of      United States executive branch entities or United States      Government contractors for communications security purposes;       (2) intercept radio communications transmitted between or      among foreign powers or agents of a foreign power as defined      by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978; or       (3) access an electronic communication system used      exclusively by a foreign power or agent of a foreign power as      defined by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.                                                                    ____         Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1996--Summary       Sec. 1. Short Title. The Act many be cited as the      ``Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1996.''       Sec. 2. Purpose. The Act would ensure that Americans have      the maximum possible choice in encryption methods to protect      the     security, confidentiality and privacy of their lawful wire      and electronic communications. For those Americans who choose      an encryption method in which another person, called a ``key      holder,'' is voluntarily entrusted with the decryption key,      the Act would establish privacy standards for the key holder,      and procedures for law enforcement officers to follow to      obtain assistance from the key holder in decrypting encrypted      communications.       Sec. 3. Findings. The Act enumerates fifteen congressional      findings, including that a secure, private and trusted      national and global information infrastructure is essential      to promote citizens' privacy and meet the needs of both      American citizens and businesses, that encryption technology      widely available worldwide can help meet those needs, that      Americans should be free to use, and American businesses free      to compete and sell, encryption technology, programs and      products, and that there is a need to develop a national      encryption policy to advance the global information      infrastructure and preserve Americans' right to privacy and      the Nation's public safety and national security.     Sec. 4. Freedom to Use Encryption       (a) Lawful Use of Encryption. The Act legislatively      confirms current practice in the United States that any      person in this country may lawfully use any encryption      method, regardless of encryption algorithm, key length or      implementation selected. The Act thereby prohibits any      government-mandated use of any particular encryption system,      such as a key escrow encryption system.       The Act further makes lawful the use of any encryption      method by United States persons in a foreign country. This      provision is consistent with, though broader than, the      Department of State's new personal use exemption published in      the Federal Register on February 16, 1996, that permits the      export of cryptographic products by U.S. citizens and      permanent residents who have the need to temporarily export      the cryptographic products when leaving the U.S. for brief      periods of time. For example, under this new exemption, U.S.      citizens traveling abroad will be able to take their laptop      computers containing copies of Lotus Notes software, many      versions of which contain an encryption program otherwise not      exportable.       (b) General Constructions. Nothing in the Act is to be      construed to require the use of encryption, a key escrow      encryption system, or a key holder if a person chooses to use      a key escrow encryption system.       Sec. 5. Encrypted wire and electronic communications. This      section of the Act adds a new chapter 122, entitled      ``Encrypted Wire and Electronic Communications,'' to title 18      of the United States Code to establish privacy standards for      key holders and to set forth procedures that law enforcement      officers must follow to obtain decryption assistance from key      holders.       (a) In General. New chapter 122 has five sections.       Sec. 2801. Definitions. Generally, the terms used in the      new chapter have the same meanings as in the federal wiretap      statute in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2510. Definitions are provided for      ``encryption'', ``key holder'', ``decryption key'', and      ``decryption assistance''. A ``key holder'' may, but is not      required to be, a Federal agency.       This chapter applies only to wire or electronic      communications and communications in electronic storage, as      defined in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2510, and not to stored electronic      data. For example, encrypted electronic mail messages,      encrypted telephone conversations, encrypted facsimile      transmissions, encrypted computer transmissions and encrypted      file transfers over the Internet would be covered, but not      encrypted data merely stored on computers.     Sec. 2802. Prohibited acts by key holders       (a) Unauthorized release of key.--Key holders will be      subject to both criminal and civil liability for the      unauthorized release of decryption keys or providing      unauthorized decryption assistance.       (b) Authorized release of key.--Key holders are authorized      to release decryption keys or provide decryption assistance      with the consent of the key owner, as may be necessary for      the holding or management of the key, or to investigative or      law enforcement officers upon compliance with the procedures      set forth in subsection (c).       (c) Requirements for release of decryption key to      investigative or law enforcement officer.--To obtain access      to a decryption key or decryption assistance from a key      holder, an investigative or law enforcement officer must      present to the key holder the same form of lawful process      used to obtain access to the encrypted content. For example,      to obtain the decryption key to, or decryption assistance      for, an encrypted telephone conversation that is the subject      of a court-ordered wiretap under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2518, a law      enforcement agent must present a court order to the key      holder to obtain the decoding key. Likewise, to obtain the      decryption key to, or decryption assistance for, an encrypted      stored wire or electronic communication, a law enforcement      officer must present a court warrant, order, subpoena or      certification, depending upon what process was used to      obtain access to the stored communication.       Key holders may only provide the minimal key release or      decryption assistance needed to access the particular      communications specified by court order or other legal      process. Released keys or other decryption assistance may      only be used in the manner and for the purpose and duration      expressly provided by court order or other legal process.       A key holder who fails to provide the decryption key or      decryption assistance called for in the court order, subpoena      or other lawful process may be penalized under current      contempt or obstruction laws.       (d) Records or other information held by key holders.--Key      holders are prohibited from disclosing records or other      information (not including decryption keys) pertaining to key      owners, except with the owner's consent or to an      investigative or law enforcement officer, pursuant to a      subpoena, court order or other lawful process.       (e) Criminal penalties.--Key holders who violate this      section for a tortious, malicious or an illegal purpose, or      for direct or indirect commercial advantage or private      commercial gain, will be subject to a fine and up to 1 year      imprisonment for a first offense, and fine and up to 2 years'      imprisonment for a second offense. Other reckless and      intentional violations would subject the key holder to a fine      of up to $5,000 and up to 6 months' imprisonment.       (f) Civil damages.--Persons aggrieved by key holder      violations may sue for injunctive relief, and actual damages      or statutory damages of $5,000, whichever is greater.       (g) Defense.--A complete defense is provided if the      defendant acted in good faith reliance upon a court order,      warrant, grand jury or trial subpoena or statutory      authorization.       Sec. 2803. Reporting requirements. The Attorney General is      required to include in her report to the Administrative      Office of the U.S. Courts under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2519(2), the      number of orders and extensions served on key holders to      obtain access to decryption keys or decryption assistance.      The Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts      is required to include this information, and the offenses for      which the orders were obtained, in the report to Congress      under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2519(3).       Sec. 2804. Unlawful use of encryption to obstruct justice.      Persons who willfully use encryption in an effort and for the      purpose of obstructing, impeding, or prevent the      communication of information in furtherance of a federal      felony crime to a law enforcement officer, would be subject      to a fine and up to 5 years' imprisonment for a first      offense, and up to 10 years' imprisonment for a second or      subsequent offense.     Sec. 2805. Freedom to sell encryption products       (a) In general.--The Act, legislatively confirms that it is      lawful to sell any encryption, regardless of encryption      algorithm, key length or implementation used, domestically in      the United States or its territories.       (b) Control of exports by Secretary of Commerce.--     Notwithstanding any other law, the Act vests the Secretary of      Commerce with control of exports of hardware, software and      technology for information security, including encryption for      both communications and other stored data, except when the      hardware, software or technology is specifically designed or      modified for military use.       No export license may be required for encryption software      and hardware with encryption capabilities that is generally      available, including mass market products (i.e., those      generally available, sold ``as is'', and designed for      installation by the purchaser) or encryption in the public      domain and generally accessible. For example, no licenses      would be required for encryption products commercially      available without restriction and sold ``as is'', such as      Netscape's commercially available World Wide Web Browser,      which cannot be exported. Similarly, no license would be      required to export software and corresponding hardware placed      in the public domain and generally accessible, such as Phil      Zimmerman's Pretty Good Privacy program, which has been      distributed to the public free of charge via the Internet.       In addition, the Secretary of Commerce must authorize the      export of encryption software to commercial users in any      country to which exports of such software has been approved      for use by foreign financial institutions, except when there      is substantial evidence that the software will be diverted or      modified for military or terrorists' end-use or re-exported      without requisite U.S. authorization. Finally, the Secretary      of Commerce must authorize the export of computer hardware      with encryption capabilities if the Secretary determines that      a product with comparable security is commercially available      from foreign suppliers without effective restrictions outside      the United States.       Significantly, the government is authorized to continue      controls on countries that pose terrorism concerns, such as      Libya, Syria and Iran, or other embargoes countries, such as      Cuba and North Korea, pursuant to the Trading With the Enemy      Act or the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.       (b) Technical Amendment. The Act adds new chapter 122 and      the new title in the table of chapters in title 18 of the      United States Code.       Sec. 6. Intelligence activities. The Act does not authorize      the conduct of intelligence activities, nor affect the      conduct by Federal government officers or employees in      intercepting (1) encrypted or other official communications      of Federal executive branch or Federal contractors for      communications security purposes; (2) radio communications      between or among foreign powers or agents, as defined by the      Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA); or (3)      electronic communication systems used exclusively by foreign      powers or agents, as defined by FISA.                                                                    ____                                              Murray Hill, NJ,                                                    March 1, 1996.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate.       Dear Senator Leahy: Thank you for introducing the Encrypted      Communications Privacy Act of 1996. As a member of the      computer security and cryptology research community, I have      observed firsthand the deleterious effect that the current      regulations governing the use and export of cryptography are      having on our country's ability to develop a reliable and      trustworthy information infrastructure. Your bill takes an      important first step toward creating regulations that reflect      the modern realities of this increasingly critical      technology.       Unlike previous government encryption initiatives such as      the technically-flawed and unworkable ``Clipper'' chip, your      bill re-affirms the role of the marketplace in providing      ordinary citizens and businesses with a full range of choices      for securing their private information. In particular by      freeing mass-market cryptographic software and hardware from      the burdensome export controls that govern the international      arms trade, the bill will help the American software industry      compete, for the first time, in the international market for      high-quality security products.       Law enforcement need not fear the widespread availability      of encryption; indeed, they should welcome and promote it.      Encryption thwarts electronic predators by preventing      unauthorized access to private data and computer systems, and      the use of strong cryptography to protect computer networks      is becoming as natural and necessary as the use of locks and      burglar alarms to protect our homes and businesses. While      criminals, too, might occasionally derive some advantage from      the use of cryptography, the benefits of widely-available      encryption technology overwhelmingly favor the honest user.      By recognizing that those who hold decryption keys on behalf      of others are in a special position of trust, your bill is      respectful of the privacy of law-abiding citizens without      introducing impediments to the government's ability to      investigate and prevent crime.       I have also examined the new provision designed to      discourage the use of cryptography by criminals in the      furtherance of a felony, and hope to see your carefully-     worded language reinforced by a narrow interpretation in the      courts, consistent with your intent.       Again, thank you for your continued leadership in this      area, and I look forward to doing whatever I can to help you      bring encryption regulations in line with the fast-changing      reality of this emerging technology.           Sincerely,     Matt Blaze.                                                                    ____                                                    March 1, 1996.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate.       Dear Senator Leahy. I would like to thank you for      introducing the Encrypted Communications Privacy Act. As a      member of the computer and information security research      community, I am keenly aware of the vital role of      cryptography in fostering the development of our information      infrastructure.       As the author of the book, ``Applied Cryptography'', I have      unusual insights into the absurdity of cryptography export      restrictions. It is not without irony that one may export my      book in paper format, but not electronically. Presumably no      rational person believes that the current restrictions      actually prevent the spread of cryptography. I believe you      recognize this, as evidenced from the strong stance taken in      your bill.       As the bill recognizes, we can no longer afford to hold on      to the obsolete notion that cryptography is the sole province      of government communications; the growth of modern networks      has irrevocably pushed it into the mainstream. I applaud your      leadership towards codifying these principles in a balanced      and responsible way. In particular, the bill:       Removes the regulatory strangle-hold that has encumbered      the development of mass-market security solutions; Recognizes      the futility of applying regulations intended to control the      international arms trade to even the most mundane and      commonly available software; Encourages public confidence in      encryption by allowing the marketplace to provide a full      range of choices for privacy and security needs; Recognizes      the special obligations of keyholders to be vigilant in      safeguarding the information entrusted to them, without      imposing hurtles on the use of cryptography; Allows the      United States to continue its leadership role as a      technological innovator; Acknowledges the pivotal role of      cryptography in electronic commerce.       I continue to have concerns that the new criminal      obstruction provision will discourage law abiding citizens      from using cryptography. I hope that legislative history and      further discussion will demonstrate the narrow intent of this      crime.       Overall, your bill takes very necessary strides towards      ensuring that the protections we take for granted in      traditional media keep pace with technology, and I commend      your efforts.           Sincerely,     Bruce Schneier.                                                                    ____                                   Business Software Alliance,                                    Washington, DC, March 4, 1996,     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: As President of the Business Software      Alliance (BSA), I am writing to express our strong support      for the Encryption Communications Privacy Act of 1996 which I      understand you will introduce tomorrow. BSA represents the      leading publishers of software for personal computers and the      client server environment including Adobe, Autodesk, Bentley,      Lotus Development, Microsoft, Novell, Sybase, Symantec and      the Santa Cruz Operation.       We have had an opportunity to review the legislation and      find it a significant step toward placing the U.S. software      industry on a level playing field with our foreign      competitors. Currently, we are only allowed to export weak      (40-bit) encryption. Your legislation would allow us to      export generally available software which offers security at      prevailing world levels. While many would prefer export      restrictions being lifted in their entirety, this legislation      at least would place us on an equal footing with our foreign      competitors which is critical to the continued success of the      U.S. software industry in the global market place.       As you well know, today, America's software industry is the      envy of the world. U.S. software companies hold an estimated      75% worldwide market share for mass market software with      exports accounting for more than one-half of revenues for our      companies. According to a 1993 study by Economists Inc., the      American mass market software industry was the fastest      growing industry in the U.S. between 1982 and 1992 and had      become larger than all but five manufacturing industries.      This translates into jobs here in the U.S.       The continued growth and success of our industry is      directly threatened by existing U.S. government export      controls. For that reason, our companies have consistently      made this one of its top policy issues. As importantly, the      availability of easy to use, affordable encryption will be      essential to the successful development of the Global      Information Infrastructure (GII). As more and more      transactions are being done on-line, consumers are      increasingly demanding software with strong encryption      capabilities. In two studies, 90% of the respondents believe      information security is important. In one study 37% of the      respondents said that they would consider purchasing foreign      software with otherwise less desirable features if that      software offered data security not available in a U.S.      program. Additionally, a recent study shows there are nearly      500 foreign encryption products from 28 countries currently      available. U.S. export restrictions simply put U.S. industry      at a competitive disadvantage. Your bill would address this      issue by allowing U.S. industry to export generally available      software with strong security features.       As you may know, the Administration has attempted to      address this issue with a ``64-bit key escrow encryption      proposal.'' Under that proposal, in order to be allowed to      export software with strong security features, U.S. industry      would be required to build a back door into the program with      a spare key held by a U.S. government certified agent. After      careful and serious deliberation by our members, we concluded      that the Administration's approach is fatally flawed and      cannot be the basis for progress in this area. We simply have      not found a market for such a product. Any resolution must be      market driven. Your bill takes a very different approach. It      reaffirms Americans right to chose the encryption they use,      either with key escrow or without. For those who chose      voluntarily to use key holders, your legislation provides      standards so that their privacy is not violated. Your      legislation allows the market to work. We wholeheartedly      endorse this market driven approach.       The digital information age and the Global Information      Infrastructure present opportunities and challenges to      computer users concerned about privacy at home and in their      businesses, as well as for the U.S. government. From that      point of view, we are all in a similar position. Information      security policies for the electronic world are fundamental to      the success of the GII and we are pleased to support your      legislation which is pro-market, pro-competition, pro-privacy      and pro-progress.       We look forward to working with you toward the enactment of      this legislation.           Sincerely,                                           Robert W. Holleyman II,                                                        President.
