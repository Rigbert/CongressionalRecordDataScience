 President, now I know who I have to thank that I can get 5 minutes. So I thank the Senator from Alaska. But in show of my appreciation, I say to him that on the matter he spoke about in relation to our energy needs, I look forward to helping solve a great deal of our energy issues because through our Committee on Finance we will be dealing with a lot of tax issues that deal with the efforts to spur production and alternative energies.  A very big part of your program that you have introduced--and we compliment you for being a leader in trying to solve the energy crisis--will be the work of the committee on which the Senator and I serve. I will be very happy to work on that.                          ____________________
