President, today I pay tribute to a wonderful friend, Bishop Thomas C. Ely, who is retiring from his leadership position of the Episcopal Diocese of Vermont.  Bishop Ely has been an outstanding servant of the Vermont diocese since his consecration as bishop in 2001. During his tenure in the Green Mountain State, he has served as the leader of the 45 Episcopal congregations in Vermont and one more across Lake Champlain in Essex, NY. He has visited all parishes once a year and counseled many clergy members. Bishop Ely's devotion to human dignity and dignity education influenced every church in the diocese. He demonstrated this as chairman of the board and as an educator of Rock Point School in Burlington, where his wife Ann worked all through his tenure as bishop. Bishop Ely, as a promoter of social justice and equality, also showed leadership in many other ways. He has been active in immigrants' rights, marriage equality, improving the lives of those living in poverty and in Bishops Against Gun Violence. His work on human rights is illustrated in his long commitment to the human rights organization Cristosal, which works in Central America.  Recently, Bishop Ely completed the successful Partnership Campaign for Rock Point, raising over $2 million to assure the future of the 130 acres owned by the Church on Lake Champlain in Burlington. The funds will improve the trails and facilities in partnership with the city of Burlington and the Lake Champlain Land Trust, preserving 93 acres for public access.  I am proud to say that Bishop Ely lives his faith, through worship, leadership, and through action to improve and enrich the lives of all Vermonters. His journey of faith and action would not have been possible without the love and support of Ann Ely who, in addition to her work at Rock Point School, has also been deeply involved in St. Paul's Cathedral in Burlington.  The outpouring of gratitude and love for Tom and Ann has been enormous, in particular at the May 18, 2019, convention, where Vermont Episcopalians elected their next bishop. The applause would not cease until Bishop Ely motioned for quiet, so that proceedings could continue. Bishop Ely is loved by his people and greatly appreciated by many Vermonters for his principled leadership. He made a difference, helping us to live up to our ideals, and will be fondly remembered, as he and Ann enter a new phase of their lives. Marcelle and I are delighted that Tom and Ann will continue to be citizens of Vermont, living in the beautiful town of Newfane. We both value their friendship.  In honor of Bishop Ely's retirement, I ask that the December 5, 2017, Episcopal New Service article ``Vermont Episcopal Bishop Thomas Ely announces plans to retire,'' be entered into the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Episcopal News Service, Dec. 5, 2017]      Vermont Episcopal Bishop Thomas Ely Announces Plan to Retire       The Right Reverend Thomas C. Ely, tenth bishop of the      Episcopal Diocese of Vermont, recently announced his      intention to retire and resign his ministry, no later than      September 30, 2019. He has agreed to remain in his position      until a successor is chosen and is in place.       Ely, 65, was consecrated as bishop of the Vermont diocese      in 2001, having previously served as a priest in the Diocese      of Connecticut for 20 years. In a message to the people of      the Diocese of Vermont, Ely said that by the time of his      retirement he will have served in the priesthood for nearly      39 years.       ``There are other interests and ministries to which I am      feeling called to devote my time and energy while my health      and stamina are still good,'' Ely said, ``including family,      community theatre, various justice ministries and a bit more      golf.''       During his episcopate, Ely has been a leader both within      the diocese and throughout the wider Episcopal Church on such      controversial issues as marriage equality, the ordination of      LGBT clergy, increased gun safety and racial justice. He is      also a leading voice on matters of environmental and economic      justice.       As part of his global outreach, Ely serves on the board of      Cristosal, a nongovernmental agency based in El Salvador that      works to advance human rights in Central America.      Additionally, he is a co-founder of the Vermont chapter of      Kids4Peace, a grassroots interfaith youth movement dedicated      to ending conflict and inspiring hope in Jerusalem and      divided societies around the world. More locally, Ely is a      leading advocate for the Vermont Ecumenical Council and      Vermont Interfaith Action.       Ely has been instrumental in the stewardship and      revitalization of Rock Point, a 130-acre property in      Burlington, owned by the Vermont diocese, known for its      natural beauty and peaceful atmosphere. Each year, nearly      10,000 people visit Rock Point, and Ely is overseeing a $1.7      million partnership campaign aimed at improving facilities,      strengthening leadership and expanding public access.       Ely said that he and his wife, Ann, will take up residence      in their house in Newfane, Vermont, upon his retirement. In      the meantime, he says, ``I plan to use these months ahead to      continue encouraging full and passionate engagement in our      local mission approaches, and I plan to continue my efforts      related to a sustainable Rock Point and all that means to our      life as the Episcopal Church in Vermont.''                          ____________________
