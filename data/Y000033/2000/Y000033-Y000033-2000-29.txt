Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in support of S. 2485, the St. Croix Island Heritage Act. This bill directs the Secretary of the Interior to provide assistance in planning and constructing a Regional Heritage Center in Calais, Maine.  St. Croix Island is located in the St. Croix River between Maine and Canada. It is the only international historic site in the national park system. In 1604, the French landed on the island and began construction of a settlement, which became the first permanent settlement in the New World. In October 1998, the National Park Service completed a general management plan to manage and interpret the St. Croix Island international historic site. In the year 2004, the U.S. and Canada will celebrate the 400th anniversary of the settlement of the St. Croix Island. This bill will facilitate the development of a Regional Heritage Center in downtown Calais, Maine, to be a central focus point for this celebration.  The bill authorizes $2 million for the planning and construction of the heritage center and requires a dollar-for-dollar match by non-Federal sources. I believe that this bill has merit, and I support its passage.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
