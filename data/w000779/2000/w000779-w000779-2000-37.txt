President, today I am pleased to introduce, with my friend and colleague from Oregon, Senator Gordon Smith, the Fort Clatsop National Memorial Expansion Act of 2000. I am also pleased that Congressman David Wu, representing Fort Clatsop and Clatsop County in the United States House of Representatives, is introducing companion legislation in the House.  The Fort Clatsop Memorial marks the spot where Meriwether Lewis, William Clark and the Corps of Discovery spent 106 days during the winter of 1805. The bicentennial of their historic journey is fast approaching and it is estimated that over a quarter-million people will visit the Memorial during the bicentennial years of 2003 through 2006. Despite this anticipated influx of visitors, the Memorial is still legally limited to no more than 130 acres. This legislation would authorize the boundary expansion of the Memorial to no more than 1500 acres so as to help accommodate the large number of expected visitors.  Since the 1980s, the U.S. Park Service in Astoria, Oregon has been trying to negotiate a land purchase with Williamette Industries to acquire approximately 928 acres for the expansion of the Ft. Clatsop National Memorial. These acres are integral to the interpretation and enjoyment of the Memorial's historic site. Over the past 13 months the Park Service and Willamette Industries negotiated and, recently, reached an agreement that will lead to the Park Service acquiring this property. Before that can happen, however, this legislation, authorizing the expansion of the park boundary, will allow the Park Service to acquire the Willamette land administratively. The bill also authorizes a study of the national significance of Station Camp, another Lewis and Clark stopping point in 1805, located in Washington State.  The Park Service has targeted the expansion of the Fort Clatsop Memorial as one of its highest priorities. The Clatsop County Commission supports this legislation, as do the local landowners in and around the Memorial. In addition, I have heard from the National Parks and Conservation Association [NPCA], the Trust for Public Lands and the Conservation Fund, all of whom support efforts to expand the Ft. Clatsop Memorial.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to see this legislation pass because the protection of this important American historic area will enable us to illustrate the story of Oregon and America's western expansion for all who visit this special place. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3119       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Fort Clatsop National      Memorial Expansion Act of 2000''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds the following:       (1) In 1805, the members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition      built Fort Clatsop at the mouth of the Columbia River near      Astoria, Oregon, where they spent 106 days waiting for the      end of winter and preparing for their journey home. The Fort      Clatsop National Memorial was created by Congress in 1958 for      the purpose of commemorating the culmination, and the winter      encampment, of the Lewis and Clark Expedition following its      successful crossing of the North American continent, and is      the only National Park Service site solely dedicated to the      Lewis and Clark Expedition.       (2) The 1995 General Management Plan for the Fort Clatsop      National Memorial, prepared with input from the local      community, calls for the addition of lands to the memorial to      include the trail used by expedition members to travel from      the fort to the Pacific Ocean and to include the shore and      forest lands surrounding the fort and trail to protect their      natural settings.       (3) The area near present day McGowan, Washington where      Lewis and Clark and the Corps of Discovery camped after      reaching the Pacific Ocean, performed detailed surveying, and      conducted the historic ``vote'' to determine where to spend      the winter, is of undisputed national significance.       (4) The National Park Service and State of Washington      should identify the best alternative for adequately and cost      effectively protecting and interpreting the ``Station Camp''      site.       (5) Expansion of the Fort Clatsop National Memorial would      require Federal legislation because the size of the memorial      is currently limited by statute to 130 acres.       (6) Congressional action to allow for the expansion of Fort      Clatsop for both the trail to the Pacific and, possibly, the      Station Camp site would be both timely and appropriate      before the start of the national bicentennial celebration      of the Lewis and Clark Expedition planned to take place      during the years 2004 through 2006.     SEC. 3. ACQUISITION OF LANDS FOR FORT CLATSOP NATIONAL                    MEMORIAL.       The Act entitled ``An Act to provide for the establishment      of Fort Clatsop National Memorial in the State of Oregon, and      for other purposes'', approved May 29, 1958 (Chapter 158; 72      Stat. 153), is amended--       (a) by inserting in section 2 ``(a)'' before ``The      Secretary''.       (b) by inserting in section 2 a period, ``.'', following      ``coast'' and by striking the remainder of the section.       (c) by inserting in section 2 the following new      subsections:       ``(b) The Memorial shall also include the lands depicted on      the map entitled `Fort Clatsop Boundary Map', numbered and      dated `405-80016-CCO-June-1996'. The area designated in the      map as a `buffer zone' shall not be developed but shall be      managed as a visual buffer between a commemorative trail that      will run through the property, and contiguous private land      holdings.       (c) The total area designated as the Memorial shall contain      no more than 1,500 acres.''       (d) by inserting at the end of section 3 the following:       ``(b) Such lands included within the newly expanded      boundary may be acquired from willing sellers only, with the      exception of corporately owned timberlands.''     SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF STUDY OF STATION CAMP.       The Secretary of the Interior shall conduct a study of the      area known as ``Station Camp'' near McGowan, Washington, to      determine its suitability, feasibility, and national      significance, for inclusion into the National Park System.      The study shall be conducted in accordance with Section 8 of      Public Law 91-383 (16 U.S.C. 1a-5).                                 ______
