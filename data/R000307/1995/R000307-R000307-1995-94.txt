 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to term limits. I think with an issue as important as this, one Member's warning flag in regards to the law of unintended consequences is another's banner of reform.  I know that each Member's conviction is such that everybody becomes an author of the best approach. I do appreciate that.  I associate myself with the eloquent and persuasive remarks of the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Hyde]. I am for the term limit, as has been said that was put in by the Founding Fathers, a 2-year limit. It is called an election. If you utilize your constitutional voting rights, the voters can, has, will, continue to throw the rascals out--if they so choose.  What term limits basically say is that for the sake of change the voters should be denied the right to keep their elected Representative--if they so choose.  I am going to skip past all the pros and cons that have been highly featured in this debate and get to the basic point. The basic point is this: If this House of Representatives is in crisis to the extent that we deny the voters the right to reelect their representatives after six terms, then it follows the people responsible for this sorry state of affairs must be those Members who have served here over six terms. And, as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid said, ``Who are these guys?''  Well, for one thing, after the briars and brambles of past scandals and resulting reform and the vote for change in the last election, there are not near as many as there were before. Over half of the Congress is new since 1990.  If you want to limit terms to 12 years, you better think about it. The average term of service is now 10. Less than one-third of the House has served more than six terms. What we have here is a mandate for term limits, but not for current Members. We have a terminal illness that is abound and rampant in the House, but we are going to wait 12 years before we take the medicine.  Why? I think the answer is pretty simple. General support for term limits is strong. It has been mentioned, 70, 80 percent. But if you say, ``Oh, it is your Member, your Congressman from your district?'' then that drops rather drastically. And proponents of term limits do not find it very pleasant telling fellow members they are part of the problem, and it is time for them to say ``adios.'' As a matter of fact, most of the term-limit proponents slide up to you and say, ``Don't worry, we are not talking about you. It won't affect you.'' And therein lies the truth of the matter.  I know there are proponents who believe a revolving-door Congress and change for the sake of change would restore a citizen legislature, but you do not get too far in the debate before it becomes obvious regarding the politics of this purge. It is the other guy that is the problem, not me, and not thee.  But if it is off with the public-service heads, whose heads are we talking about? Who in this Congress has been here too long? Using the automatic term limit theory, it appears as if we are talking about most of the Republican and Democrat leadership, the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Gingrich], the gentleman from Texas [Mr. DeLay], the gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Gephardt], the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Bonior]. Let's wipe out the leadership. That is the ticket. Or is it? My word, that is almost insurrection. So it must be somebody else that is at the root of this problem. I took the liberty of just going down the State delegations. Let us see, there is the gentleman from Alabama [Mr. Bevill], he has been there for 30 years, a most respected Member. He cannot be part of the problem. Is it the gentleman from Arizona [Mr. Stump], 24 years? I do not think it is Bob. The gentleman from California [Mr. Dellums] and the gentleman from California [Mr. Lewis]? I do not think so. My friend from Colorado, Mr. Schaefer? I am not trying to single anybody out. The voters can. But term limits cannot.  It must be the gentleman from Florida [Mr. McCollum], that is who it is, 4 years over this term limit at 16 years. He is the author of one of the proposals. But Bill was unopposed in the last election. His voters just apparently did not get it. The gentlewoman from Hawaii [Mrs. Mink], the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Hyde], the gentlewoman from Illinois [Mrs. Collins], the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Porter], the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Burton], the gentleman from Kentucky [Mr. Rogers], the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Livingston], the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Frank], the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Moakley], the gentleman from Mississippi [Mr. Montgomery]. There is a good one, ``Sonny'' Montgomery, one of the most respected Members of the House. The gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Emerson], the gentlewoman from New Jersey [Mrs. Roukema], the gentleman from New York [Mr. Schumer], the gentleman from New York [Mr. Rangel], the gentleman from Ohio [Mr.  [[Page H3919]] Oxley], the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Regula], the gentleman from Oregon [Mr. Wyden], the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Foglietta], the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Shuster], the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Gekas], the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Goodling], the gentleman from South Carolina [Mr. Spence], the gentleman from South Carolina who wants term limits. Tell Floyd he is out and you are in. The gentleman from Tennessee [Mr. Quillen]; who is going to tell us when to vote if we term limit Jimmy Quillen? The gentleman from Texas [Mr. Archer], the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Fields], the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Bateman], the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Bliley], the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Wolf], the gentleman from West Virginia [Mr. Mollohan], the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Petri], Pat Roberts, Pat Roberts? Now, quiet, no applause. All shapes and sizes and different stripes in regards to their politics.  But you know something, all of these Members received over 70 percent of the vote, or they were unopposed. Could these elected Representatives actually be doing a good job for their constituents and, depending on your point of view, for their country? Did Senators Everett Dirksen, Hubert Humphrey, or do Sam Nunn and Bob Dole, did Congressman Bob Michel and Bill Natcher, our beloved Bill Natcher?  Every once in a while in a democracy there comes a time when we succumb to populist sentiment, and the emotion of the moment. We usually call it reform, and then we experience the law of unintended effects and spend the next several years trying to reform the reform.  This is different. This is different. This amends the Constitution. We do not need to go down this path in order to achieve reform and a House responsive to the people.  It is a paradox of enormous irony that in order to make the Congress more responsive to the people, we are recommending a limit on their voting rights.  The gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Hyde] is right. Henry Hyde is right. Trust the people.
