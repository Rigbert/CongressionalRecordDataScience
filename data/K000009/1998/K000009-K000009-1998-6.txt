Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I wanted to enter into the record, because the staff gets so little recognition and just reading their names does not seem to be enough, but I do have to say we have the best staff in the Congress on this subcommittee. To Tim Sanders, our hat is off to him, to Sally Chadbourne, to Bobbi Jeanquart, to John Ziolkowski, to Martin Delgado and Jim Richards. I thank them very much for helping America help our people.                              {time}  1500  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey), the ranking member on the Committee on Appropriations. There is no harder fighter in our country for the needs of farmers and ranchers, including dairy farmers in his own state.
