Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a good friend of mine, Eric Matzner, of Palm Springs, California, who recently passed away. He loved his family, and his country. His story of escaping the Nazis, and then building a successful life in the U.S. is a wonderful story about America. The following was written by his daughter Jill:  It was Austria, 1938. Hitler had terrorized this country and will have killed over six million people before he is through. My father's family is one that has lost many. Just six of his family members ultimately survive. Those wishing to immigrate to the United States from Austria must do so by boat, and only with the vouching of an approved sponsor.  My father's memories as a six year old are vivid; memories of the German storm troopers marching down the street in their trademark ``Goosestep'' fashion. As they stopped, they would raise their right arm, hand straight out and yell ``Heil Hitler.'' Any civilian who did not address authority or Hitler in this way was either beaten or killed. Those who survive must wear yellow arm bands bearing the Star of David to separate the Jews from the rest of the population.  Eric's father owned a jewelry store. Before long, the store was taken from him, forcing his parents to make the biggest decision of their lives. Should they stay, not knowing what lay ahead? Or, should they sacrifice virtually everything they've ever known and flee for the freedom of America? They stayed hidden until they escaped Austria on November 9, 1938. As it turns out, history will remember this night as Kristallnacht, the ``Night of Broken Glass.'' The attack against Jews that evening was swift. Many were killed and thousands incarcerated in concentration camps. Eric vividly remembered the sound of broken glass and the smell of burning buildings. On that night they left Austria behind.  They found themselves on a boat, headed for the country of which they had only heard and dreamed of to start a new life. It was a treacherous trip. Steerage was cramped and miserable. Many people become violently ill throughout the trek across the ocean. They were allowed to take one bag each. Few valuables, possessions or family treasures survived the voyage.  After the long ocean journey, a large figure slowly appeared in the distance: the Statue of Liberty. It was a sight that Eric would remember forever.  As a young man, Eric excelled at baseball and football. He met Elaine Heritage (my mother) at Drexel University in 1951. They dated for a few years and later married. It was a challenge at first with my father being Jewish and my mother being Methodist, but they overcame these differences. Due to my father's childhood experiences, his four children were taught that differences in people are to be embraced, not condemned. It is a wonderful part of our heritage to have been raised with both religions and such diversity.  Eric was an early salesman for TV Guide, and held jobs in advertising in the 1960s. He was an original ``Mad Man!'' His creative selling was legendary, and influenced many young salespeople who are all successful today.  As I think about my father's journey, I believe he was alive because of the foresight of his parents to escape Austria, a strong will to live, modern medicine and the drugs that were available to him. If not for these, I do not believe my father would have lived to be 80 years old and to have been a warm, loving husband to my mother, Elaine, a father to his four children, a grandfather to his five grandchildren and a great grandfather to my son's son.  No one, not even my father, could imagine that he would see the year 2012. Although he was immobile in his final years, he never complained. He lost most of his short term memory, but retained most of his long term memories. With his ever present smile, we smiled with him, when on nearly every day he said, ``I'm telling you, this might be the best day of my life.''                          ____________________
