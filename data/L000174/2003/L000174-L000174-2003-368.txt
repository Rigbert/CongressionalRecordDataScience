President, let me respond this way. I have been in the Senate for 29 years. I love the Senate. I love following our normal course of doing business. The Senator from Pennsylvania has raised an appropriate question. I suggest that is a question that should be directed to the Republican leader and the Democratic leader and the chairman and the ranking member of the committee, which is the normal course of doing business, the way we have always done it. Naturally, I would be guided by the direction of the Republican and Democratic leaders, not only in the Senate but in the committee.  Obviously, I am not in a position to speak for the Republican or Democratic leaders or the Republican chairman or Democratic ranking member on this issue. The Senator from Pennsylvania is perfectly within his rights in raising the issue, and I hope that might prompt a discussion with them.
