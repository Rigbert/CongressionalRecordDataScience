President, I strongly urge my colleagues to support S. 830, the FDA Modernization and Accountability Act.  This bill deserves support for one primary reason. It preserves the FDA's essential mission of validating the safety and effectiveness of new drugs and medical devices, while encouraging innovation and the commercialization of new, life-saving therapies.  This bill is the result of much debate, and tremendous consensus building over the last two Congresses. I'm proud to have played some part in this as a Member of both the House and the Senate, having introduced more than 2 years ago H.R. 1472, the FDA Modernization Act of 1995, which contains several of the key ingredients of the legislation before us today.  From the time we get up in the morning until the time we go to bed at night, we live, work, eat, and drink in a world of products affected by FDA decisionmaking.  Perhaps no other Federal agency has such a broad impact in the daily lives of average Americans.  Food handling and commercial preparation often occurs under the agency's scrutiny. Over-the-counter drugs and nutritional supplements, from vitamins to aspirin, also are certified by the agency.  Life-saving drugs for treatment of cancer, autoimmune deficiency, and other dread diseases are held to its rigorous approval standards.  Medical devices ranging from the simple to the complex, from tongue depressors to computerized diagnostic equipment, must meet FDA quality standards.  These products overseen by the FDA are woven deeply into the fabric of our daily lives, and the agency's twin missions of certifying their safety and effectiveness is supported by the vast majority of Americans.  Yet, balancing those missions against the time and expense required by manufacturers to navigate the FDA approval system has been difficult and controversial. In the last Congress, radical transformation of the agency, even ending the agency as we know it and replacing it with a panel of private-sector, expert entrepreneurs, became a goal of some.  At the very least, reforming the FDA at the beginning of the 104th Congress looked to be an exercise fraught with partisan political turmoil, and destined for gridlock.  But while there was focus on the extreme ends of the argument, those folks arguing for no changes against members demanding wholesale dismemberment of the agency, a broader, bipartisan middle developed.  And with the help of Vice President's Gore's Reinventing Government Program, Members of Congress from both political parties developed practical, bipartisan solutions to the critical process and management problems in the FDA approval process.  I sought to mobilize this bipartisan movement with H.R. 1472 introduced in June 1995. Some in my own party thought I had gone to far, too fast, But I am gratified that many of the elements of that legislation have been retained and strengthened in the legislation and managers amendment we expect to have before us this week.  These include: It streamlines approval systems for biotechnology product manufacturing; it allows approval of important, new breakthrough drugs on the basis of a single, clinically valid trial; it creates a collaborative mechanism allowing applicants to confer constructively with the FDA at critical points in the approval process; it sets reasonable but strict timeframes for approval decisionmaking; it reduces the paperwork and reporting burden now facing manufacturers when they make minor changes in their manufacturing process; it establishes provisions for allowing third-party review of applications at the discretion of the Secretary; and it allows manufacturers to distribute scientifically valid information on uses for approved drugs and devices which may not yet be certified by the FDA.  I am especially pleased that Senators Mack, Frist, Dodd, Boxer, Kennedy, and I could offer the provisions of this legislation relating to the dissemination of information on off-label uses of approved products.  This provision will allow manufacturers to distribute scientifically and clinically valid information on such uses following a review by the FDA, including a decision by the agency which may require additional balancing material be added to the packet.  Here's why that's important: Manufacturers with an approved drug for ovarian cancer may have important, but not yet conclusive information from new trials that their drug also may reduce brain or breast cancers. That data, while perhaps not yet of a grade to meet supplemental labeling approval, may be important for an end-stage breast cancer patient whose doctor has exhausted all other treatments.  That doctor, and her patient, has the absolute right to that information.  This legislation will save lives, not sacrifice them.  It will mean that more doctors and their patients will have meaningful access to life-saving information about drugs that treat dread diseases like AIDS and cancer.  It will mean that biologic products will have a swifter passage through an approval process which no longer will require unnecessarily difficult demands with regard to the size of a start-up manufacturing process.  It will mean that break-through drugs which offer relief from, or curses of deadly disease for which there is no approved therapy will get into the marketplace earlier, on the basis of a special expedited approval system.  But legislation, indeed laws, are only words on paper.  Mr. President, we must also have a new FDA Commissioner who is as committed to these changes as former Commissioner David Kessler was committed to the war on teenage smoking.  The pharmaceutical industry is a robust, risk-taking, technology-drivenbusiness. But by measure of total U.S. employment growth in this industry is stalling out. While sales by U.S.-based concerns continue to increase, more of the industry's manufacturing--its jobs--is migrating overseas. Part of the reason is rising domestic development costs. According to Tufts University, the average development time for a new drug is now up to 7 years. And the cost of such developments now figures out at something close to $360 million per product. We shouldn't kid ourselves about who foots the bill for these high development and approval costs--it's the consumer, and it comes via the extraordinary high prices we pay on drugs which can spell the literal difference between life and death.  S. 830 significantly reforms that regime, recognizing that we all--government, industry, and consumers--have a real stake in cutting the explosive costs of bringing new medical products to the marketplace, and in making available break-through, life-saving therapies more quickly, and at a lower price.  Along with these important reforms, S. 380 also reauthorizes for 5 years the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, a very successful program that has helped swiftly approve scores of new life-saving therapies.  Let me also point out that while this bill makes substantial and far-reaching improvements, it distinctly moderates last year's reform effort.  So-called hammers that would have caused the agency to lose jurisdiction over the approval process if tight decision-making deadlines were not met have been eliminated.  Also missing is last year's provision requiring the agency to approve products previously approved in Europe.  My colleagues should understand that this bill is the result of efforts to reach a true common ground on many tough issues. Many more issues were gray, than they were black or white. Extremists on neither side of the debate can claim an advantage, or a victory.  The real victory, I believe, will be realized by the American consumer.                          ____________________
