 President, on the issue of delay, I am trying to avoid bursting out in laughter. The two NLRB nominees were sent up to the Senate December 15, 2011--December 15, 2011. Before their paperwork got here, 2 weeks later the President recess appointed them. Delay? Their paperwork had not even arrived. The committee could not do anything with them. A couple of weeks later they were recess appointed.  That is not my definition of a delay, by any objective standard.  The core issue here, no matter how much the majority leader tries to obfuscate and discuss other matters, is that he is prepared to break the rules of the Senate to change the rules of the Senate for three nominees who were unconstitutionally appointed, according to the Federal Circuit Court in Washington, DC. For that, the majority leader proposes to use the nuclear option? It is a sad, sad commentary on today's Senate.
