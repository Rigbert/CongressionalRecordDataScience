 President, I wish to make a few short observations about a severe storm that hit my hometown and dumped 6 inches of rain in 75 minutes in Louisville just today, causing major flooding and trapping people in their cars and in their neighborhoods. The Louisville Police and Fire and Rescue have been working nonstop since early this morning to assist those in need. I wish to commend them for the courageous and outstanding work they have been performing throughout the day.  Not surprisingly, I have heard from a number of my constituents. I appreciate very much their calls to keep me informed on the latest developments. We are going to continue to monitor the situation back home. In the meantime, our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone in Louisville today.                          ____________________
