Speaker, I want to thank the chairman of the subcommittee, the gentleman from California (Mr. Packard), all of the Members on both sides of the aisle of the subcommittee, for their diligent work. I would also want to thank all of the members of the staff.  I would suggest to the membership this is a good bill and I would encourage them to vote for it.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Edwards).
