 We have a lot of young students today who would make outstanding teachers, who would be able to contribute to the future of this country in a very positive way by getting a teaching degree and being a teacher in one of our schools.  However, if we send the message today that teachers will be in an overcrowded classroom, they are not going to have the support, the backing of Congress and legislatures, and teachers will be sitting in overcrowded classrooms, my guess is, we will have a decreasing number of students willing to work in the public education system.
