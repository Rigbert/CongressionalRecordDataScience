Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the amendment, although I am not opposed to it.  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  There was no objection.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I really appreciate the gentleman's work here in pointing out the problem with our bridges, not just in New York, but nationwide, 147,000 deficient bridges. In fact, as one of the few Democrats who opposed the so-called stimulus bill, I said at the time we would have been better served had we invested that money in projects, real projects, as opposed to tax cuts.  One thing I suggested was how about a plan to rebuild all of the deficient bridges in America, put a million or so people to work, and solve a long-term problem. That wasn't to be, but this brings new focus to the issue, and, hopefully, we will get around to dealing with this issue in the near future with the information to be gleaned from this report.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gibson).  The amendment was agreed to.                 Amendment No. 11 Offered by Mr. Guinta  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 11 printed in part B of House Report 114-325.
