 President, I would like to recognize and enter into the Record a recent speech presented to the Des Moines Rotary Club by Hans Becherer, Chairman and CEO of Deere and Company. His remarks are insightful and provide a long term outlook from one of the leaders in our agricultural community. The speech is entitled, ``All Farming is Global''.       Today I'd like to discuss some of the major trends that      will help shape agriculture as it moves into the new century      and millennium. This is of particular importance to Iowa      since almost one-fourth of the state's population works in      the agricultural complex . . . and 90% of the land area is      devoted to farms.       Farming remains critical to John Deere, as well. Although      we've diversified a good deal in recent years, both in      product breadth and geographic reach, farm machinery remains      our flagship business . . . and the domestic farmer our      number one customer.       Needless to say, the farm sector is struggling right now      due to depressed grain and livestock prices. As a result,      North American retail demand for farm equipment is expected      to be off 25% or so this year with lesser reductions in      Europe. Accordingly, we're making aggressive cutbacks in our      production in order to adjust inventories and bring more      balance to the market.       One farmer, on an Internet message board devoted to Deere,      recently summed it up this way: ``The quality of the green      tractor is there,'' he said. ``The quality of the green money      to pay for it isn't.''       Thus far, that seems to be a fair assessment of the      situation.       Of course, the farm economy was in good shape heading into      this downturn, from the standpoint of debt levels and land      values, and will likely prove quite resilient. There's      nothing to suggest this will be a rerun of the 1980s.       Moreover--the next year or two aside--the future of farming      looks extremely promising for the long run.       That's what I'd like to focus on this afternoon--less the      problems of the present, than the promise of the future.       Of the key forces dictating change in agriculture today,      the most important ones concern increasingly open markets and      freer trade; the explosive growth in technology, which is      transforming the entire economy these days; plus, the      continuing importance of environmental issues.       Let's take a closer look at these issues now.                           *   *   *   *   *       As a first point, farming is becoming far more market-     oriented.       Most of us, I suspect, believe in free trade and open      agricultural markets. We feel farmers in Iowa have a lot to      gain from such a situation. We have, after all, some of the      world's best farmland literally in our backyards, plus an      excellent distribution system for getting crops to market,      and access to highly productive farm machinery.       Just what does an open market, increasingly free of      controls and restrictions, mean to the farm sector?       Mostly, it will accelerate trends already under way--     putting a premium on large, efficiently run operations that      are able to make the most of today's technology and fast-     moving markets.       Less-regulated farming will have a positive impact in terms      of overall economic efficiency--and it's likely a plus for      the nation's agricultural complex as a whole. It certainly      gives U.S. farming a leg-up in a global market, something      that works to Iowa's benefit.       As for the decline in smaller farms, this very definitely      marks the passing of an era, which many find a source of      regret. But it's a process that has been in motion for some      time: Even in the robust economic environment of the last few      years, Deere was selling less than half as many tractors and      combines to the domestic market as in the early 1970s. The      number of U.S. farms has contracted by one-third (from 3 to 2      million) over this time, with a similar pattern seen in Iowa.       I should point out that some small operators will do quite      well in tomorrow's less-regulated market. These are the ones      who devote themselves to a type of management-intensive, or      niche, agriculture, such as growing organic crops. Still, it      will take quite an entrepreneurial breed to overcome the      economies of scale that are becoming more and more a part of      farming.       Along the same lines, a more open agricultural climate      means farming will become more internationally focused and      geared to exports. Indeed, the farmer of the future will have      to be a man of the world.       And that's definitely a plus for Iowa.       Agriculture has always been regarded as the most basic of      local enterprises. And rightly so: What could be more a part      of our communities than our own soil? Farming, moreover,      has constituted the soul of rural life in our country for      over 200 years, and been widely associated with the      virtues of honesty and hard work that built America.       But in truth, ladies and gentlemen, all farming is global.       Every ear of corn, or pod of soybean produced in Iowa makes      an impact on the world market . . . and affects farmers in      faraway places such as Australia and Argentina.       Similarly, every drop of rain that falls on Brazil's      creddados . . . has an effect on Iowa's farms and fields.       Legislation approved in Berlin and Brussels . . . is felt      by farmers in Burlington and Belle Plaine.       Soybean prices went into a nosedive awhile back . . . not      because of a leap in supply or a lag in demand, but because      the Brazilian currency lost one-quarter of its value over-     night. Brazil, of course, is a major soybean producer and      exporter. That action alone shaved roughly a dollar a bushel      off bean prices.       Global trade, manifested by exports, has become a mainstay      for our nation's farmers. Roughly one-fourth of farm receipts      today come from overseas sales. And Iowa is right in the      thick of things, being the nation's number-two exporter of      agricultural commodities ( $4B year) after California.       Farm exports will drop this year due to the economic      travails of the developing world and are down almost 20%--or      $10 billion--from their peak. But this is almost surely a      short-lived phenomenon . . . and completely at odds with the      long-range picture.       The world's fundamentals--namely, strong population growth,      improved diets and more open trade policies--all point to      U.S. farming, and Iowa agriculture, being an export-driven,      growth-intensive business with solid prospects well into the      future.                           *   *   *   *   *       Farming will get more competitive, too, as farmers scramble      to add value to their crops and gain an edge in productivity,      yields and costs.       Technology--my second point--will help them get there.      Technology, of course, has been the story in agriculture      since the days of Cyrus McCormick's reaper . . . John Deere's      plow . . . and the Waterloo Boy tractor. Forerunners of      modern-day combines and cotton-pickers weren't far behind.       The cultural effect of ever-more productive machinery goes      well beyond the farm. It's what transformed our society into      an industrial power since it takes so much less physical      labor to feed our population today. The average farmer gets      as much done by 9 a.m. now as in a full day in the post-war      1940s. Over this time, crop production has nearly tripled      from virtually the same amount of farmland. Especially      noteworthy, farm-labor's role in the agricultural process has      dropped by more than two-thirds during this time.       What accounts for such improvements? Technology, mostly . .      . in the form of better seeds and fertilizer, as well as--     indeed--more sophisticated farm machinery.       As important as technology has been to farming's past . . .      it's fair to say we haven't seen anything yet. Genetically      modified seeds . . . plus precision, or satellite-guided,      farming and other, almost unimaginable, advances in      information technology . . . put farming on a truly exciting,      high-tech plain for the new century.       Going forward, in fact, a farmer's biggest problem will not      be having access to technology, but figuring out how to apply      it to his best advantage. ``What we're trying to do here,''      one farmer recently said at a precision-farming conference,      ``is create knowledge out of chaos.''       Meeting this need--helping farmers bridge the gap between      information and intelligence--may constitute a promising      business opportunity in its own right. Deere recently formed      a new business unit--John Deere Special Technology Group--to      help supply solutions to these challenges.       One of the unit's most exciting new ventures is the      VantagePoint network, a kind of silo in cyberspace. More to      the point, VantagePoint is an Internet-based data-warehouse      subscription service that allows farmers to collect, store,      and reference a full array of data about their farming      operation--such as yield and seed population. Subscribers can      also see aggregated data from neighboring areas. VantagePoint      functions as a server to contain this information . . . and,      as an interface, to organize and present the data in creative      and useful ways.       As for the Internet itself, we believe it adds an important      new dimension to the selling process, which should work to      the benefit of our John Deere dealers . . . by helping them      provide even more responsive service and counsel.       A number of dealers have their own websites. Many more are      listing used equipment on a company-sponsored site called      MachineFinder-dot-com, launched late last year. Roughly 6,000      pieces of equipment, mostly tractors and combines, are      presently available over MachineFinder . . . and about 15,000      users have registered for the site.       What ever the future of MachineFinder and other emerging      Internet-related services, one can safely assume that      technology will play as big a role in the  success of      tomorrow's farmers as the weather or government policies.                           *   *   *   *   *       As technology makes farmers more productive, it's also      helping them be good stewards of the soil, the air and the      water. That's the third area I'd like to touch on today.       Outside of large hog lots--which is certainly a newsworthy      issue in Iowa--the environmental side of farming doesn't grab      many headlines. But it's quite a factor in the farming      process . . . and seems likely to stay that way.       Regulation, for one thing, will see to it that farmers      remain serious about limiting emissions . . . preserving the      soil . . . and controlling the run-off of chemicals and      waste. Some of the proposals you hear about would even limit      the hours farmers spend in their fields, based on dust      restrictions. Noise abatement is an emerging concern. And      water quality seems likely to be the next big area of      regulatory focus.       All this, of course, adds cost and complexity to the      farming process. But many of the very things that make      farmers environmentally sensitive . . . are actually fiscally      sensible. That is, they help farmers become more productive      and profitable.       New engines are cleaner-burning and more efficient.      Precision farming helps farmers cut down on input costs. New      sprayers apply herbicides with laser-like precision, cutting      down on waste and over-spray.       All that's good for the environment, of course. But it's      also beneficial for the farmer's bottom line.       Iowa's farmers are truly among the unsung heroes in today's      environmental movement. For without modern fertilizers,      herbicides and machinery . . . without high-yield production      practices . . . and without the tremendous yield gains we've      seen over the years . . . an additional one-million square      miles of our nation (all the land east of the Mississippi      River, in size) would need to be plowed under and made into      cropland, merely to equal present levels of grain production.       That's no less than three miles the amount of land      currently devoted to farming. It's fair to say, moreover,      that these new fields would come at the direct expense of      forested areas and other land now serving as wildlife habitat      or as part of our natural watershed.       Clearly, farmers have done quite a job of safeguarding our      natural resources, while meeting the world's growing need for      food. Nevertheless, tomorrow's increasingly formidable      environmental pressures will require an even more intensive      commitment on their part.                           *   *   *   *   *       Regardless of the challenges ahead for agriculture, I      assure you that Deere remains firmly committed to providing      solutions to our customers' needs and customers in our case      go far beyond the farm.       Over the last several years, John Deere has worked hard to      achieve a good deal of diversification in our operations.      We've done so not by plunging into altogether-new businesses,      but by applying the lessons learned from generations of      dealing with farmers to a broader range of customers.       Our view is that the characteristics of our Waterloo-made      tractors, or Des Moines cotton pickers--such as durability      and reliability--work just as well for construction      equipment, such as Dubuque-made backhoes.       The same goes for our new skid-steer loaders, Gator utility      vehicles, golf and turf equipment or the full range of lawn-     care machinery now being offered in green and yellow.       Similarly, our Des Moines-based credit operation owes its      success not to the fact that the money it lends goes farther      than anyone else's . . . but because of the integrity and      service that has long been associated with the John Deere      name. (John Deere Credit, incidentally, is quite a successful      enterprise in its own right, normally adding 20% or so to the      company's overall net income.)       Moreover, it is these non-ag operations that have been the      focus of major investment programs of late . . . and which      we're counting on to help us achieve more consistency in our      profits whenever the farm economy weakens.                           *   *   *   *   *       None of which, in any way, dampens our enthusiasm for      farming.       Because despite some of the challenges I've mentioned--and      the current downturn is very real and painful--the future for      agriculture looks good.       Darned good, in fact.       Regardless of Indonesia's financial problems . . . the      world still has 10,000 new mouths to feed every hour, and,      again, will need three times today's grain output within 50      years.       No matter what's ahead for Brazil's real or Russia's ruble      . . . a good deal of money will be spent on the increased      consumption of meat--which is a primary driver of demand for      grain.       Beyond the Third World's growing pains . . . the global      farm population, now over 40%, will shrink as industrial      growth creates new opportunities and higher living standards.      This will make Iowa's contribution to the world food supply      all the more important.       True, these things may take shape more slowly than we      expected, but the fundamental trends are headed in the right      direction.       All point . . . to a promising future . . . for a globally      attuned . . . technologically astute . . . environmentally      aware . . . agricultural sector--such as exists in Iowa and      surrounding states.                          ____________________
