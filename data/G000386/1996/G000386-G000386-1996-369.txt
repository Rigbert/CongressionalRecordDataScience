  I hope one thing that all my colleagues will remember comes out of this debate. We have heard the argument from the other side that dollars define our defense. That is an upside-down way of making national security policy and the budget that is necessary to carry it out.  The way we decide how much money we are going to spend in defense is to define our national security policies, define our needs, have policy to fit those needs, and finance those policies. The other side has not made that argument. They have only made an argument that we need x number of dollars more for defense. That is upside-down reasoning.  Now, the other point I hope my colleagues remember from this debate is that we have been promised savings because of reforms. The General Accounting Office has told us--the nonpartisan General Accounting Office--has told us those savings have not materialized. They have not gone into modernization. That is what Secretary Perry said he was going to do. They have gone into administrative overhead and things of that nature.  If we are going to be promised reforms, we should see those reforms before we give more money. Whatever money we give should be based upon a policy determination of carrying out our national security goals and our interests. The other side has not made the case for more money.  I yield the floor, and I yield back the balance of my time.
