Madam Speaker, I yield to Mr. Cao, the distinguished gentleman from Louisiana.  I thank him for his leadership, the first Vietnamese American Member of Congress and a staunch fighter for human rights. I've known him in the refugee battles, especially for the boat people, and in so many other human rights' issues.  So I yield to my friend.
