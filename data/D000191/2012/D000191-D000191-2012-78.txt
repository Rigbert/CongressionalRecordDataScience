Speaker, now is not the time to delay or jeopardize the renewal of a job-creating national transportation program by insisting on a deal-breaking provision already rejected by the U.S. Senate. This motion to instruct needlessly puts millions of private sector transportation, manufacturing, engineering, and construction jobs at risk.  We desperately need long-term investments in our decrepit and failing transportation system. We need to bring certainty to states and the private sector in transportation project planning. But the continued temporary extensions of transportation authorities as passed by the House of Representatives are costing us jobs.  We are getting substantiated reports from the 50 states that they are delaying or even canceling transportation investments and projects for this construction season because of the uncertainty in federal funding. According to AASHTO, seven states will forgo at least 60,000 private sector jobs this construction season. I am certain the number would be more than a 100,000 forgone jobs if all 50 states were considered.  And remember, with strong buy American provisions in the bill, these are not just construction jobs. These are manufacturing jobs and sophisticated engineering jobs--jobs we need to keep and continue to create in this country.  Unlike the House transportation bill that would keep us limping along with 60-day and 90-day extensions, the Senate transportation bill would provide two years of funding. Instead of forgoing hundreds of thousands of jobs for this construction season alone, the Senate bill would maintain or create millions of jobs and begin making the investments we need to address the 150,000 bridges in need of repair or replacement and the 42 percent of the National Highway System pavement in fair or poor condition--to say nothing of the needed investments to move our transportation system into the 21st Century.  The Senate transportation bill also includes a desperately needed one-year extension of the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act. This program provides an essential lifeline for more than 700 rural federally forested communities and 9 million schoolchildren across the nation. For Oregon, these payments may mean the difference between keeping criminals in our jails and sheriffs on the road or financial insolvency and the dissolution of county governments.  Congress can debate the XL pipeline any day of the week. And we should. Let's have a debate about the route, expedited approval, and environmental reviews. Let's have a debate on energy policies to reduce America's dependence on foreign oil, bring down the price of gas for American consumers, and lead to a more secure energy future. But it's telling that Republican leadership has refused to bring a clean XL pipeline bill to the floor of this House. Instead, they insist on attaching it to must-pass legislation to score political points and to try to embarrass the President--these are not serious efforts to legislate.  With the national unemployment rate still hovering around 8 percent and the real unemployment rate closer to 15 percent it is absolutely unacceptable that Congress would take any risk of jeopardizing what should be a bipartisan effort to maintain or create millions of private-sector American jobs.  I urge my colleagues to reject this motion and to quickly pass a conferenced transportation bill that makes desperately needed investments in our transportation system, creates jobs, and helps ensure rural counties across the nation are able to offer basic government services.                          ____________________
