 The amendment we will be talking about is the Imperial Beach amendment. I have to remind my colleagues, as I did in the steering committee last Thursday, this is not an appropriations bill. What we are doing here today is not going to change anything at all in terms of money. I don't want anyone thinking we will have some useless project or spend money on it. We are not doing it with this bill today. We may be doing it in the future. We may be doing it when the appropriations bills come up. I may be opposing it at that time.  But all we are doing through the WRDA bill is we allow ourselves the opportunity to make sure there is some level of discipline in putting projects forward that people will eventually be voting on. They are not going to be voting on them today. This is the authorization process.  Now, we have criteria. We have to have an engineer's report from the Corps of Engineers. It has to say it is economically feasible, it takes care of the environmental problems--all these things--and it ensures there is cost sharing.  Let me tell you what would happen if we did not do this. If we did not do it, and we had everyone coming up, swapping out their deals, and saying: I have a project over here; it is my sweetheart project; the Corps of Engineers has never been there. We don't care. No one has ever evaluated it, but this is my humble opinion, since we are here in Washington making all these decisions in violation of what people back home want. Then we will have a project.  That is the alternative. This is the same as the transportation authorization bill. There we had criteria where we would talk about the qualifications of various projects, and they would have to be in that criteria. Then we would bring it up later on and decide whether we were going to fund these things.  Now, on the project that is going to take place at Imperial Beach, it was authorized. The Corps recommended this storm damage reduction project because it is technically sound, economically justified, environmentally acceptable, and it will have the local cost share.  I have a letter from the mayor of Imperial Beach saying this is what they want out there. It may not be what they want in Washington, but this is what they want.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                        City of Imperial Beach, CA                                          Office of the Mayor,                                                    July 18, 2002.     Colonel Richard G. Thompson,     Los Angeles District Engineer, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,          Los Angeles, CA.       Dear Colonel Thompson: This letter should serve as a formal      indication of interest and intent by the City of Imperial      Beach to proceed with the recommended project indicated in      the Silver Strand Shoreline, Imperial Beach, California Draft      General Reevaluation Report dated, June 2002.       The City of Imperial Beach is willing and able to provide      all non-Federal requirements of the project including 36% of      the cost to construct the initial project and 50% of the      construction costs for each renourishment cycle.       It is anticipated that funds for the local share of initial      construction will come from $4.2 million currently earmarked      for this project in the California State Department of      Boating and Waterways FY 2002/2003 budget.       We thank you for your continued interest in this worthwhile      project.           Sincerely,                                                       Diane Rose,                                                            Mayor.
