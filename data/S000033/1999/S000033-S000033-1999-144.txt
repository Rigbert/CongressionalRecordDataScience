 Chairman, I just want to ask the gentleman one simple question.  He mentioned that there is nothing wrong with going over this line by line, dollar by dollar, and that is not bad.  Would the gentleman move now to abolish the committee system of the United States House of Representatives?  Why are we wasting our time with 13 committees?  They hold hearings, and they have all these experts coming together, and let me finish.
