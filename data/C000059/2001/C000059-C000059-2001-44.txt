Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication to the community and to the overall well being of the city of Riverside, California, was unparalleled. Riverside was indeed fortunate to have such a dynamic and dedicated business and community leader who willingly and unselfishly gave of her time and talents to make her community a better place in which to live and work. The individual I am speaking of is Jacqueline ``Jackie'' Cardelucci. I was fortunate to have been able to call her my friend. She died this week in her home after a long battle with cancer at the age of 63.  Jackie Cardelucci gave much during her years to her community and the whole of the Inland Empire. Born in Huntington Park, Jackie Cardelucci moved to Riverside where she lived for 18 years. A fixture in the community, Jackie was a talented businesswoman and never shied away from community involvement. She was co-owner of National Environmental Waste Corporation (NEWCO) and International Rubbish Service with her husband, Sam, for over 32 years. In that capacity she served as the companies' Public Relations Director with the City of Riverside business customers.  On a community level, Jackie served in an impressive array of boards and organizations even while receiving chemotherapy treatments for her cancer over the past eight years. Her philanthropic endeavors included the Mission Inn Foundation Executive Board, Riverside Art Alliance, Riverside Art Museum, Associate University of California at Riverside, Riverside Community Hospital 2000 Century, President of the Riverside Republican Women Federated for three years, Riverside Opera Guild, and Armenian & International Women's Association.  My deepest condolences go to her husband of 43 years, Sam; her son and daughter-in-law, Mark and Cathie; two brothers, Elisha and Ben; and two grandchildren, Jessica and Catherine. I send my prayers to them during this time of loss.  Mr. Speaker, looking back at Jackie's life, we see a life full of courage, tenacity and devotion to her family and community. Her gifts to Riverside and the Inland Empire led to the betterment of those who had the privilege to come in contact or work with Jackie. Honoring her memory is the least that we can do today for all that she gave over her lifetime.                          ____________________
