  Mr. President, the amendment before the body is a combination amendment with Senator Dorgan. It is remedial education and a report card amendment. He will speak on the report card provisions. My amendment is on social promotion and remedial education. I hope this is one area this body can agree on; that is, the practice, formal or informal, of promoting youngsters from grade to grade when they sometimes don't even attend school and often fail classes. That is not the way to educate young people in the United States of America.  Increasingly, States are doing away with the practice of social promotion and providing standards and enabling school districts to implement those standards in the basic core curriculum--reading, writing, math, and social sciences.  This amendment tries to provide Federal incentives and Federal help for the remedial education that is necessary to make the abolition of the policy of social promotion a realistic possibility.  So it would authorize $500 million to school districts for remedial education for afterschool, summer school, intensive intervention for students who are failing or at risk of failing. As a condition of receiving the funds, the school districts would have to adopt a policy that prohibits social promotion. District would have to require students to meet academic standards. And they would test students for achievement.  Now, I think the problem is clear. This course of least resistance, of simply promoting youngsters, has really led to declining test scores, failure, frustration, and certainly the inability of many to even fill out an employment application to be able to get a job after graduation.
