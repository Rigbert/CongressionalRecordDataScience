Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Chairman, as chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I rise in very strong support of this budget resolution. I want to thank the gentleman from Iowa (Chairman Nussle) for crafting a resolution that has the largest increase in veterans' affairs spending, especially discretionary spending, for our veterans.  There is a $2.8 billion increase for health care in this budget. Let me just point out to my colleagues, it is needs-based. This is not something that was just ``let us add it for the sake of adding,'' but it is needs-based.  Next year, there will be about 700,000 new, unique veteran patients. Veterans are flocking to our outpatient clinics and our community-based outpatient clinics and the like because they are getting good health care, 700,000. The budget would provide, like I said, about a $2.8 billion increase.  Let me also point out to my colleagues that other important programs will be funded as a result of this. Last year, we passed historic legislation to help the homeless veterans. That is accommodated by this budget.  We have passed an increase in the G.I. bill, a 46 percent increase in thatcollege education benefit. That is accommodated by this budget.  I believe the gentleman from Iowa (Chairman Nussle) deserves our thanks. He sat down with my staff and I and we spent hours going line by line over why this budget needed to be added to, and he met those needs.  I hope that every veterans' service organization, and I have spoken to virtually every one of them, they are happy with what we are doing. It is real, and I would hope my friends on the Democratic side would look at this provision and realize that we are doing justice to our veterans.  It is a good bill and a good resolution. I urge strong support for this.
