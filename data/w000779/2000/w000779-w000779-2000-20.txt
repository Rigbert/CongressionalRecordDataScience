President, I will keep talking if the Senator from Missouri objects. I am sure some of our colleagues have other concerns.  I will continue on this question of dissecting medical providers' intent, as the Nickles legislation does, a dissecting exercise that will be done by law enforcement professionals rather than medical providers.  Here is what the American Cancer Society had to say about determining ``intent'' under the Nickles legislation. The American Cancer Society says: Unfortunately, intent cannot be easily determined, particularly in the area of medicine, where effective dosage levels for patients may deviate significantly from the norm. The question of deciding intent should remain in the hands of those properly trained to make such decisions--the medical community and State medical boards.  What the American Cancer Society is saying, as with these other 50 organizations, they are especially troubled that the Nickles legislation is second-guessing the pain management practices of physicians and providers all across the country. It is especially troublesome because law enforcement officials, rather than health care professionals, are going to be the ones to assess the intent of a medical provider. A medical providers' intentions under any calculus, as the American Cancer Society has noted, cannot be easily determined. To allow law enforcement officials to have this enormous discretion, after the fact, to challenge our medical providers, in my view, is going to significantly compound the undertreatment of pain in America.
