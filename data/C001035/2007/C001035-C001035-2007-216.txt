He outlined the issue very well.  I emphasize two points the Senator made. First is the cost. The National Governors Association has estimated that compliance with the requirements of the REAL ID card will impose $11 billion of costs on State governments over the next 5 years. Yet we have appropriated only $40 million to be used toward that cost, and of that amount the Department of Homeland Security has only allocated $6 million, so only a tiny fraction of the expected cost.  The second point I emphasize is the Department of Homeland Security has yet to issue the regulations detailing how States are to comply with the law.So to expect the States to comply by May of next year with regulations that have yet to be issued is simply unfair and will add another layer of costs because of the short time for compliance. This 2 years will allow a more careful review. It will allow more input by the States when DHS does issue the regulations, and it will allow us to devise a cost-effective way of achieving a goal all of us have, and that is to make driver's licenses more secure.  I am very grateful for the insights of the Senator from Tennessee, for his support, and for his very early leadership on this issue.  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
