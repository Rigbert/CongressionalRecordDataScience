President, I appreciate the compliments. But I am thinking of Shakespeare, ``I came here not to praise Caesar, but to bury him.'' Unfortunately these amendments have been buried by the objection.  I would note that yesterday we offered 17 Republican amendments and 15 Democratic amendments to be voted on. That was objected to. Those were offered by the distinguished majority leader. It is frustrating.  I know we are about to go to executive session. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Hawaii, Ms. Hirono, have 2 minutes before the executive session.
