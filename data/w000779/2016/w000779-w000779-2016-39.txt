President, I concur with Senator Hatch and also congratulate the USITC on its centennial and commend the agency for its service over the last century.  Established by the Congress as the U.S. Tariff Commission on September 8, 1916, the agency was reconfigured and redesignated as the USITC by the Trade Act of 1974. As mandated by Congress, the USITC performs three principal functions: No. 1, fairly and objectively administer U.S. trade remedy laws within its mandate; No. 2, provide the Congress, the President, and the United States Trade Representative with independent analysis, information, and support concerning matters related to international trade, tariffs, and U.S. competitiveness; and No. 3 maintain the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.  By successfully executing these functions, the USITC performs a valuable service to the U.S. Government and the American people. Those of us in Congress particularly appreciate the highly technical data and analyses that the USITC provides to help inform our formulation of U.S. trade policy.
