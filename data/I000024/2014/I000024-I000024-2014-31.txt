Carroll, of Ponca City, OK who died on September 6, 2006, of injuries sustained when he came in contact with enemy forces using small-arms fire during a dismounted security patrol while serving his Nation in Ramadi, Iraq.  John was born September 1, 1980 in Greene County, PA and moved to Lawrenceville when he was 8 years old. In his mid-teens he left to live with his father in Georgia where he earned his general education development degree. While traveling from State to State in search of employment, he was approached by an Army recruiter in Oklahoma promising a chance to continue his education and a large signing bonus. He was sold and enlisted in 1999.  John met his wife Jessica Carroll in Florida while on leave from the 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment, 1st Armored Division, Baumholder, Germany. He was on his third tour of Iraq and was due to be discharged in October 2006. After completing his service, they planned to live in Tennessee because they loved the mountains and the scenic surroundings.  A graveside service was held on September 17, 2006 at Mount View Cemetery, McMinnville, TN. Full military honors were administered by the Fort Campbell Honor Guard.  John is survived by his wife Jessica; mother Dawn Petrakovits; father Roger Carroll; two brothers Micah Carroll and Ben Beardsley; two sisters Liz Carroll and Rebecca Petrakovits; and mother-in-law Nancy Hicks and father-in-law Jerry Hicks.  Today we remember Army SGT John A. Carroll, a young man who loved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                      Corporal Wilfred Flores, Jr.  Madam President, it is my honor also to pay tribute to the life and sacrifice of Army CPL Wilfred Flores, Jr., of Lawton, OK, who died on March 31, 2007, of injuries sustained after an improvised explosive device detonated near his vehicle while serving his Nation in Ramadi, Iraq. He was 11 days short of his 21st birthday.  The son of retired Army Sergeants First Class Wilfred Sr. and Vicky, he was born April 10, 1986, at Fort Sill, OK. A member of the Jr. ROTC program, he graduated from Eisenhower High School in Lawton in 2004 and entered the Army Delayed Entry Program.  While waiting for his enlistment time, he volunteered at Giddy Up & Go, a non-profit therapeutic horse riding program for disabled children and adults. Wilfred joined the Army as an infantryman after completing basic and advanced individual training at Fort Benning, GA. After training he was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 14th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division, Fort Drum, NY. He was on his second deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  A memorial service was held on April 15, 2007, at Frontier Chapel on Fort Sill, OK. Burial with full military honors followed on April 16, 2007, in the new Fort Sill National Cemetery near Elgin, OK.  Wilfred is survived by his parents Wilfred Sr. and Vicky Flores; sister Theresa Siegrist; grandfather retired Air Force SSG Modesto Flores, Jr.; three nieces; and numerous aunts, uncles and cousins.  Vicky Flores said her son was very religious, very generous and believed ``God had a hand in everything. He loved his job,'' she said. ``He was there because he wanted to be there. He died doing what he loved the most.''  Today we remember Army CPL Wilfred Flores, Jr., a young man who loved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                        Sergeant Buddy J. Hughie  Madam President, it is my honor also to pay tribute to the life and sacrifice of Army SGT Buddy J. Hughie, of Poteau, OK, who died while serving his Nation in Kamdesh, Afghanistan on February 19, 2007.  Born October 23, 1981 in Carlsbad, NM, and a 2005 graduate of Poteau High School, Buddy and his unit were conducting a joint mission with the Afghan National Army and the U.S. Army's 10th Mountain Division in the country's Nuristan province when the group came under enemy small-arms and rocket-propelled-grenade fire. After two Afghan soldiers in the group were wounded, he left his position to provide medical assistance when he was shot and killed.  ``Sgt. Buddy Hughie was a great American,'' said LTC Bobby Yandell, commander of the 1st Battalion, 180th Infantry. ``Sgt. Hughie was one of those soldiers that you did not have to worry about; he always did the right thing. We mourn his loss, but celebrate the life of a great soldier.'' Buddy, who previously deployed to Afghanistan in 2002-2003, volunteered to return to the country, Yandell said.  More than 600 people filled Poteau High School's Sherman Floyd Fieldhouse to honor Buddy's life. Burial was conducted on February 28, 2007, in Live Oak Memorial Gardens in Charleston, SC.  ``He didn't have to be in Afghanistan, he didn't have to serve that 45 days in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina. He was there because he believed in what he was doing. More importantly, he backed those beliefs by action'' said BG Myles L. Deering, the commander of the Oklahoma National Guard's 45th Infantry Brigade.  He is survived by his wife Alexis Hughie; son Cooper; grandparents Kenneth and Delores Hughie; his mother Julie Hicks; a sister Jennifer Claiborn; a brother Dennis Hicks; and his great-grandparents Andrew ``Buddy'' and Dimple Rogers.  Today we remember Army SGT Buddy J. Hughie, a remarkable young man who loved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                        Sergeant Justin L. Noyes  Madam President, it is my honor also to pay tribute to the life and sacrifice of Marine Sgt Justin L. Noyes, of Vinita, OK, who died on July 2, 2006, of injuries sustained while attempting to disarm an improvised explosive device in Al Anbar Province, Fallujah, Iraq.  Born August 8, 1982 in Tulsa, OK, Justin played football and baseball at Vinita High School where he graduated in 2002.  Just 1 day before his 18th birthday and shortly after graduating from high school, Justin enlisted in the Marine Corps. He and his brother, Jeremy were first deployed to Iraq for the start of the war in 2003 and were there whenSaddam Hussein's statue came tumbling down.  While conducting training in North Carolina, he met his wife Sarah and they were married on May 15, 2005, in Florida in a ceremony overlooking the Gulf of Mexico.  In August 2005, Justin was reassigned as an explosive ordnance disposal technician with the 9th Engineer Support Battalion, 3rd Marine Logistics Group, III Marine Expeditionary Force, Okinawa, Japan.  A memorial service was held on July 17, 2006 at Cowboy Junction Church in Vinita, OK. As the hearse carrying his body made its way to the church, it passed more than 500 American Legion members lined along the road, each holding an American flag. Justin's death apparently touched the Craig County community to its core. Hundreds of residents, some saluting, some with their hands over their hearts, and all waving flags of every size, poured out of homes, offices, department stores and convenience stores to line the funeral route, which flowed through downtown Vinita. As the funeral procession traveled through neighborhoods, young boys with flags on their bicycles stopped out of respect. Full military honors were rendered for the burial at Fairview Cemetery in Vinita, OK.  Justin is survived by his wife Sarah; his mother Stacey Noyes; father and stepmother Mark and Karen Noyes; brothers Jeremy Norsworthy and Chris Barnes; and sisters Hannah and Rachel Noyes.  Today we remember Marine Sgt Justin L. Noyes, a young man who loved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                    Lance Corporal Trevor A. Roberts  Madam President, it is my honor also to pay tribute to the life and sacrifice of Marine Corps LCpl Trevor A. Roberts, of Oklahoma City, OK, who died on March 24, 2007, of injuries sustained after an improvised explosive device detonated near his vehicle while serving his Nation in Anbar province, Iraq.  Trevor was born October 6, 1985 in Moore, OK. He joined the Marine Forces Reserve's 2nd Battalion, 14th Marine Regiment, 4th Marine Division, Oklahoma City in his senior year before graduating from Westmoore High School in 2004. After graduation he attended 1 year at Oklahoma City Community College before being one of 30 people from his unit who volunteered to go to Iraq as an artillery specialist.  Nearly 1,000 people attended a memorial service at Eagle Heights Church with burial in Heritage Burial Park in Oklahoma City, OK.  At the memorial service, the Rev. Rob Olmstead recalled Trevor going on numerous mission trips, including one to Bangkok to work with orphaned children the summer before he attended boot camp. Trevor felt ``God is calling me to go work for these children in the foreign mission field,'' said his father, Chuck. While in Iraq, seeing the plight of the people solidified in his mind that he wanted to be a missionary, Roberts' parents said. ``He saw some stuff he did not want to have to see,'' Chuck Roberts said. ``It hurt him. He could look at the Iraqi people and see their hurt and their pain, and he could also see their joy. He could look in their eyes and just see.''  Trevor was preceded in death by his grandfather Carl Roberts. He is survived by his parents Chuck and Twyla Roberts; brother Nathan Roberts; maternal grandmother Helen JoAn Hey and her husband Lester; grandfather Willis Ferguson; paternal grandmother Rita Roberts; uncles Andy Ferguson and his wife Angie, Barry Ferguson and his wife Amy, and Mike Roberts and his wife Sandra; aunts Susan Hall, Linda Roberts, and Patty Bratton and her husband Mark; and numerous extended family, friends, and his beloved Corp.  Joey Ware, who knew Trevor more than 10 years, said his friend always looked out for those around him. ``Trevor would do anything for anybody no matter what it cost him,'' Ware recalled.  Shortly before his death he wrote on his web page about his faith and the dangers he faced: ``Sometimes I'm awakened at night, and I can not go back to sleep for hours because something is heavy on my heart. For some reason, this is one such thing. How fast life can change on us. Over here, it might be a firefight or a roadside bomb that makes a normal drive a stir of chaos. Things most definitely don't always work out the way we dream and hope, but we have to keep going, for you never know what tomorrow might bring.''  Today we remember Marine Corps LCpl Trevor A. Roberts, a young man who loved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                     Specialist Joshua D.

He deployed to Iraq in September 2006.  An avid outdoorsman, Josh enjoyed fishing and working with wood. He was hoping to use his GI bill for an education and to learn skills that would allow him to come back to his community and work as a contractor with heavy equipment, his mother said. He wanted to become a contractor and open a saw mill. ``It was his love. He loved the outside,'' said his mother, Julie Young. ``If he got too claustrophobic sitting inside, he would go down to the woodshop.''  Funeral services and burial were conducted at Lona Valley Cemetery in Kinta, OK.  ``He would have done great things,'' said his brother Reuben, an Army private. ``When we were in school, he was my best friend, and he was my best friend when he was in the service.''  He is survived by his mother Julie Young; stepfather Marty Young; and four brothers.  Today we remember Army SPC Joshua D. Sheppard, a remarkable young man who loved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                      Corporal Jared M.

Storey, of Enid, OK, who died on August 4, 2006, of injuries sustained after an improvised explosive device detonated near his vehicle while serving his Nation in Ramadi, Iraq.  Born February 27, 1976, Clint's life crumbled around him in 1993, quitting school as he struggled to come to terms with the death of his father.

After completing training at Ft Knox, KY, Clint reported to HHC 1/5 Infantry Battalion at Ft Hood, TX, where he served as a scout platoon driver and gunner and deployed to Bosnia-Herzegovina.

In June 2006, he was seriously wounded after a bomb exploded near him outside of Hawr Rajab south of Baghdad. Although the explosion killed a fellow soldier, Clint kept firing on enemy positions, held his ground and ran more than 300 meters to get additional fire support despite receiving wounds to his legs and hand. A fearless man, his favorite quote was ``All one really needs in life is a few good pals and together they can take on anything in life.'' Even after being injured in that battle, he volunteered for dangerous duty on raids rather than sit and wait for battle.  A memorial service was held on September 23, 2006 at Jerald Barton Memorial Gymnasium in Kingston, OK.  At the memorial service, his friend B.J. Bush recalled Clint as ``a good ol' boy with a knife in his front pocket and a can of snuff in the back. He was happiest with his gun and bow sighted in and his pole rigged with hook and line.'' He was laid to rest in Willis Cemetery, overlooking his beloved Lake Texoma.  Clint is survived by his father Lavoyed Williams; mother Marci Sprouse; three brothers Duron Williams, Dalton Williams and Daniel Williams; sister Jessica Williams; grandmothers Jean Williams and Nancy Sprouse; grandfather Jack Sprouse; and two nephews Jarren Williams and Devin Williams.
