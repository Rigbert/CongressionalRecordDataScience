 Speaker, today I am reintroducing legislation calling for President Clinton to submit to the U.S. Senate and for the U.S. Senate to ratify the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child. America needs to affirm these fundamental human rights for all children. Our Nation remains one of a handful of nations that have not seen fit to affirm civil, political, economical, social, and humanitarian rights for children.  Why should we do this? Let me cite just one example.  It is wrong that at least 200 million defenseless children are working around the world today without any hope of ever seeing the inside of a classroom. Many of these abused children are making products exported for sale in our shopping malls, sporting goods stores, and oriental rug shops all across America.  Consider the plight of millions of child laborers, some as young as 4 years old, who are sold into virtual slavery; that is, bonded and indentured servants, and chained to looms for 14 hours a day hand-knotting the oriental rugs that grace the foyers and living rooms of countless homes and offices all across our country.  Exploited children toil in factories, mines, fields, at looms, and even in brothels, sacrificing their youth, health, and innocence for little or no wages.  They are hand-stitching the Nike and Adidas soccer balls that our kids practice with every day. The very same soccer balls that were used at the Atlanta Olympics last year.  They are sewing the blouses and slacks that Kathie Lee Gifford was paid $7 million a year to promote for Walmart stores until she was embarrassed last year.  They are making Mattel Barbie Dolls that little girls across America play with every day.  They are even sharpening the surgical instruments used in our hospital operating rooms.  This situation is totally unacceptable and there are actions that must be taken to stop this affront to basic human decency. That is why I authored the recently enacted law to prohibit the importing of any products made by forced or indentured child labor for the first time in our Nation's history.  At the same time, our standing to push for a crackdown on child labor around the world would be strengthened if we would ratify the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child.  I firmly believe trade is not an end in itself, but a means toward attaining more economic justice, social responsibility, and environmental sustain ability in the United States and the global economy.  The fact that current trade rules go to great lengths to protect property rights, while ignoring the rights of working people--especially children--says much about the absurd priorities of our current trade policies.  Inside and outside the halls of government, we have the power to change this sorry state of affairs. Access to the American marketplace and consumer purchasing power are powerful sources of leverage that should be used to encourage foreign producers and importers to treat defenseless children and all workers with dignity and respect.  We need a trading system that protects the fundamental rights of children and all working people and not just the property rights of corporations and financiers. I am especially delighted that some Vermont teenagers have already begun to speak out and demand action in defense of kids overseas who cannot help themselves. I applaud their human rights leadership and I hope this Congress will go beyond the recently enacted ban that I authored to cut foreign aid to countries that fail to enforce their own child labor laws and to keep any imports made by children under 14 who are employed in manufacturing or mining out of the U.S. marketplace as has been proposed by Senator Harkin, Congressman Frank, and myself.  Mobilizing the global community against the scourge of child labor is critically important. Certainly, this effort will be greatly enhanced if America joins 169 other nations that have already ratified the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child.                          ____________________
