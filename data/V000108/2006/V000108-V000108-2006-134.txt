Speaker, it is with great sorrow that I rise to remember the late Coretta Scott King. Our nation has lost one of its great leaders, but her memory will live on forever. Her legacy will live on so that future generations will continue to know and fight for the compassion and equality that she treasured so dearly.  With the passing of Coretta Scott King, our country has lost a leader; a leader who dedicated her life to doing what was right and what was just. In order to carry out her legacy--and that of her husband, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.--we must each individually dedicate ourselves to the causes they so passionately believed in.  Equality, justice, and opportunity drive the human spirit forward, and by working on behalf of these principles, Coretta Scott King advanced the causes of mankind. My heart, thoughts and prayers go out to her friends and family. Our nation will miss her greatly.  As we reflect on Coretta Scott King's legacy, we are reminded of the challenges that democracy poses to us and the delicate nature of liberty. Her life reminds us that we must continually fight to secure and protect our freedoms. In her courage to act, her willingness to meet challenges, and her ability to achieve, she embodied all that is good and true in the battle for liberty.  After she married Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and as a young pastor he began his civil rights work in Montgomery, Alabama, Mrs. King worked closely with him. She organized marches and sit-ins at segregated restaurants while balancing an equally daunting task: raising their four children. She held the family together as it endured the tragic events surrounding Dr. King. Even after her family home was bombed in Montgomery, she persevered--at a time when most would have given up. Those children, Yolanda Denise, Martin Luther III, Dexter Scott, and Bernice Albertine are as much a part of her legacy as her dynamic civil rights work.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues rise in honor of the legacy and life of Coretta Scott King. Her determination and dedication has made our world a better place to live, and I am proud to honor her legacy.                          ____________________
