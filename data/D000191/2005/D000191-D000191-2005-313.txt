Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.  If this is to close the debate, the important message to the American people is that this is an investment that will pave their way, smooth their way to work and on their errands, in taking their kids to school, and make the kids safer going to school. It will put their friends, their neighbors and themselves to work. It will improve the efficiency of the United States economy. And these are all jobs and all investments that will be made 100 percent American, here at home in the United States of America.  I believe it resolves a lot of problems with our economy. It will put a lot of folks to work. Real jobs for real people on needed projects, investing their tax dollars in the way they were intended when they paid that tax at the pump.  As the ranking member pointed out, it could be more. If we keep full faith with the American people, we should invest that money now and not hold it back to create illusory deficit offsets. It cannot be spent on anything else but transportation infrastructure.  This is a good bill today. Hopefully, it will be a better bill tomorrow and when we come back, before the end of May with the conference from the Senate.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
