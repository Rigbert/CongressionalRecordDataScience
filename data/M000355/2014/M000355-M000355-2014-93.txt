 President, I rise today to pay tribute to an upstanding citizen from my home State, the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The Reverend Gregg W. Anderson is an accomplished news reporter and dedicated prison chaplain, ministering to inmates in the Commonwealth.  Though he has traveled the world, and worked as a reporter at radio and television stations across the Midwest, Reverend Anderson is honored to call Bardstown in Nelson County, KY, his home, where he hosts ``Talk of the Town'' Monday through Friday evenings on WBRT, Bardstown's hometown radio station on 97.1 FM and 1320 AM. This year, WBRT celebrates its 60th anniversary informing and cultivating a special relationship with the Bardstown community.  During his nearly four decades as a news reporter, Reverend Anderson has enjoyed a varied and successful career covering everything from Super Bowls to bank robberies. However, he has found no assignment more rewarding than that of ``a good news reporter,'' bringing the good news of Christ to others.  His conversion experience began after he covered the horrific 1988 Carrollton school bus crash. Killing 27 people, including 24 children, the Carrollton crash remains the worst drunk-driving accident in our Nation's history.  The gruesomeness and heartache Reverend Anderson witnessed following that crash inspired him to begin bringing the light of Christ to others. On May 15, 1988, the day after the accident, Reverend Anderson felt called by God to be a ``good news reporter.'' One year later he founded 70x7 Evangelistic Ministry. Continuing as a news reporter by day, Reverend Anderson began his ministry career by preaching at church services and revivals at night.  His ministry eventually brought him to the prisons of Kentucky and Ohio, where he became a devoted and beloved prison chaplain. Reverend Anderson worked with the prisoners, bringing many hardened criminals the message of Christ. Reverend Anderson eventually took his prison chaplaincy overseas, ministering to inmates in Estonia and Latvia, before returning to the United States.  The Reverend Gregg W. Anderson's dedication seems to know no bounds. His devotion and commitment to his work, whether in news reporting or in his Christian ministry, is an inspiration for us all, and I ask that my Senate colleagues join me in honoring him today.                          ____________________
