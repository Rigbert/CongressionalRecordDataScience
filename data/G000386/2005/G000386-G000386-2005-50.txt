 President, I rise today to honor one of our country's bravest, SPC Gregory L. Tull of Pocohontas, IA. Specialist Tull sadly died November 25, 2005, after an improvised explosive device detonated near his Humvee in Al Anbar province in Iraq. Specialist Tull served with the Iowa Army National Guard's 1st Battalion, 194th Field Artillery based in Storm Lake, IA. He was only 20 years old.  I ask that all Americans join me in remembering and honoring Specialist Tull. He was an upstanding and courageous soldier who fell far before his time. Our country has survived these many years due to the brave men and women who have served in our Armed Forces, and it greatly saddens me to announce that another young man has made the ultimate sacrifice for our country and for the freedom of Iraq.  LTC Gregory Hapgood of the Iowa Army National Guard remembered that Specialist Tull was ``a good guy that didn't shrink from responsibility,'' and was someone who ``wanted in on the action.'' During this crucial time in America's history, we should all remember Greg Tull's courage and dedication to his country.  We should also stand with Specialist Tull's parents, Eileen and Gary, and his brother, Bryan, and all his family in their time of grief. Our thoughts and prayers also go out to Gregory's friends, classmates, and all others who were lucky enough to know him. Greg Tull did not die in vain, but rather gave his life defending America and promoting freedom around the world. He will be sorely missed but also fondly remembered.                          ____________________[Pages S13495-S13496]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES                       Corporal Jonathan F.
