Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute just to close.  In my 21 years as a Member of this House, I have never seen such an unprecedented unity and solidarity with our fellow Americans as has been expressed by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. This has been an extraordinary debate, a bipartisan expression of our very deep concern and anguish over the horrific loss of human life and an ironclad resolve to effectively prosecute the war on terrorism.  It has all been said, Mr. Speaker, today and into this evening.
