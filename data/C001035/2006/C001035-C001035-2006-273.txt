President, I thank the junior Senator from Mississippi for his kind comments. He has been so helpful as a member of the Commerce Committee and the Finance Committee in helping us weave our way through a very difficult maze. Without his advice and support, I doubt that we would be here tonight. I express my personal appreciation to Senator Lott for his guidance and his assistance and for keeping us all focused on the goal. We could never let turf battles or jurisdictional disputes block us from accomplishing such a needed and important task. He helped us keep our eye on the ball. I thank the Senator very much for his comments.  Mr. President, I was talking about the hearings we were having. Our most recent hearing was in April on the GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act, which I mentioned Senator Murray and I had introduced. We heard also from the House leaders on port security, including Representative Dan Lungren and Representative Jane Harman, as well as other experts on our Nation's ports.
