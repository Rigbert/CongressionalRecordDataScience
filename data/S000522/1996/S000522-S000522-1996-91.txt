Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2137, sponsored by my good friend and colleague, the gentleman from New Jersey, Dick Zimmer, designed to correct a flaw in the 1994 crime bill concerning registration of criminal sex offenders and notification provisions. The weakness of the 1994 omnibus crime bill could and should have been resolved in the original legislation, but it was not.  Members may recall, for example, that on July 13, 1994, the House voted on a motion by the gentlewoman from Washington [Ms. Dunn] to instruct the conferees to insist on Senate provisions that call on States to track sexually violent offenders released from jail and allow law enforcement agencies acting in good faith and with immunity from liability laws to notify communities of their presence. The conferees turned a blind eye to that motion. This legislation is an excellent attempt to correct this omission from the 1994 crime bill.  Mr. Speaker, as my friend pointed out, in late July 1994, a young 7-year-old girl named Megan Kanka was sexually assaulted and brutally murderedby a twice-convicted sex offender who lived across the street from the Kanka's home in Hamilton Township, which is in my district. The entire community, Mr. Speaker, was absolutely stunned and horrified.  Despite the fact that they were overcome with indescribable grief and pain, Megan's heroic parents, Maureen and Richard, mounted a full court press to enact State and Federal legislation to track criminal sex offenders and to inform and notify communities of their whereabouts.  In New Jersey, State Senator Pete Inverso and Assemblyman Paul Kramer, with the full backing of Governor Christie Whitman, quickly moved on legislation that became known as Megan's law. Other States followed suit. Still many States lag in enacting laws to inform communities as to the proximity of sex offenders. I still find it tragic beyond words, Mr. Speaker, that no one knew that Megan Kanka's killer lived across the street. No one knew that the murderer was a two-time convicted sex offender who was released from prison in 1988 after spending 6 years of a 10-year sentence. No one knew that he lived with two other men who had previous records of sex crimes against children. No one knew that unspeakable danger and perversion was in the neighborhood and no one knew that 1 day that perversion would lure an innocent child to her death.                              {time}  1545  Megan's courageous parents had an absolute right to know of this danger, and they have been working ever since to protect other parents from going through that terrible agony that they have suffered. All parents, Mr. Speaker, have a clear and compelling need to know if their neighbors prey on kids. This legislation advances that cause.
