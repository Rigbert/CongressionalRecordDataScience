 This cycle is not the result of green, or capitalism, or animal spirits, or irrational exuberance. Ultimately, it is caused by our failure to recognize and enforce traditional legal principles, namely, the protection of private property.  According to Huerta de Soto: It is a remarkable fact that three of the most noted monetary theorists of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries were bankers: John Law, Richard Cantillon, and Henry Thornton. Their banks all failed.  Law was involved in the infamous Mississippi scheme, and Cantillon was involved in a fraudulent stock trading scheme. Only Thornton escaped controversy because his bank did not fail until after his death. All of these bankers were actively involved in convincing their colleagues and customers of the safety, soundness, and wisdom of violating traditional legal principles.  Once upon a time, common sense as well as the law recognized the difference between a demand deposit and a loan deposit.  According to Huerta de Soto, ancient Roman law made it clear that bankers carried out two different types of operations. On one hand, they accepted demand deposits, which involved no right to interest and obligated the bank to maintain the continuous availability of the money; and the depositor had absolute privilege in the case of bankruptcy. On the other hand, bankers also received loan deposits, which obligated the banker to pay interest on the money; and the depositor lacked all privileges in the case of bankruptcy.  The clear distinction between these two types of deposits began to break down with the unfortunate choice of a penalty for the failure to return a demand deposit. A banker who accepted a demand deposit and later failed to return the money upon demand was obligated to pay a penalty in the form of interest.  According to Huerta de Soto, the ban on usury by the three major monotheistic religions--Judaism, Islam, and Christianity--did much to complicate and obscure medieval financial practices. Historically, usury meant charging any interest on a loan. Today, it means charging excessive interest on a loan.       Since it was forbidden to pay interest on loans, it is easy      to understand how convenient it was in the Middle Ages to      disguise a loan as a deposit in order to make the payment of      interest legal, legitimate and socially acceptable. For this      reason, bankers started to systematically engage in      operations in which the parties openly declared they were      entering into a deposit contract and not a loan contract.       The method of concealment . . . was a simulated [demand]      deposit which . . . was not a true [demand] deposit at all,      but rather a loan [deposit]. At the end of the agreed-upon      term, the supposed depositor claimed his money. When the      [bank] failed to return [the money], [the bank] was forced to      pay a ``penalty'' in the [form] of interest on [its] presumed      ``delay.''       Disguising loans as deposits became an effective way to get      around the canonical ban on interest and escape severe      sanctions, both secular and spiritual.  It would appear the history of banking consists of a continuous effort to eliminate the distinction between these two types of deposits. I do not mean to criticize modern day bankers. I suspect they are largely unaware of this history. They simply operate under the rules as they exist today. Anyone who studies money and banking in college is taught about fractional reserves, deposit insurance, and the need for a central bank to serve as lender of last resort. This is standard fare that passes for higher education around the world.  As economist John Maynard Keynes once observed, ``even the most practical man of affairs is usually in the thrall of the ideas of some long-dead economist.''  Having said all this, the question remains: Where do we go from here?  To answer that question let me return to the topic of money. In a world of paper currency--without the backing of any tangible commodity--the supply of money is ultimately determined by the government.  In most countries, the power to create money has been delegated by the government to a central bank. The central bank in turn controls the money supply in a number of ways: buying and selling financial assets--so-called discount window or open-market operations--and requiring banks to keep deposits at the central bank--so-called reserve requirements.  As our Nation's central bank, it is often suggested that the Federal Reserve controls both interest rates and the money supply. However, the only interest rate the Fed controls is the discount rate. That is the rate the Fed charges other banks when they borrow money from the Fed. The Fed generally prefers that banks borrow from each other. So, it usually sets the discount rate higher than the rate banks charge each other. That rate is called the Federal funds rate.  U.S. banks are required to hold reserves as a percentage of their demand deposits, but not their loan deposits. These reserves are designed to cover daily withdrawals. On any given day, some banks may have a reserve shortfall, while others may have excess reserves. Thus, banks borrow from each other on an overnight basis. The Fed sets a target for the interest rate banks charge each other--the Federal funds rate--and then it attempts to achieve its target.  According to the textbook explanation, when the Fed wants to lower the Federal funds rate, it buys financial assets, such as government bonds, from other banks and pays for them by creating additional reserves. This is sometimes referred to as creating money out of thin air. Since the banks now have more reserves, they are generally willing to lend at a lower rate. When the Fed wants to raise the Federal funds rate, it sells financial assets back to the banks and withdraws the additional reserves. Since the banks now have fewer reserves, they will usually require borrowers to pay a higher interest rate.  The Fed can also change the supply of money by changing the reserve requirement. By raising or lowering the reserve requirement, the Fed can control how much money banks must hold in reserve. Higher reserves mean less money is available for banks to lend, and lower reserves mean more money to lend.  Although central banks control the money supply in the long run, in the short run individual banks are largely in control.  As the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago explained in its publication Modern Money Mechanics:       In the real world, a bank's lending is not normally      constrained by the amount of reserves it has at any given      moment. Rather, loans are made, or not made, depending on the      bank's credit policies and its expectations about its ability      to obtain the funds necessary to pay its customers' checks      and maintain required reserves in a timely fashion.  In other words, when banks make loans, they create new deposits, thereby increasing the money supply. In the short run, banks are free to make as many loans as they want based solely on their expectation of future repayment and their ability to meet required reserves and expected withdrawals, plus their capital requirements.  In the long run, central banks control reserve requirements and the cost of borrowing excess reserves. Thus, they can eventually prevent individual banks from endlessly expanding the money supply.  Money can be defined as the thing that all other goods and services are traded for, or as the means to achieve final settlement of all transactions. As the means of final payment, money is uniquely valued above all other assets. It is considered to be the most liquid because it is accepted by everyone and it trades at face value. That is, $1 is always equal to $1.  Because banks have the power to create money--within limits set by the central bank--they are viewed with a high degree of suspicion. But banks are ultimately at the mercy of their customers because they are obligated to convert deposits into cash. When banks lose the confidence of their customers, they are subject to bankruptcy if too many customers try to withdraw their money. Banking panics in the past led to the creation of central banking and deposit insurance. These government safety nets were designed to prevent the collapse of the banking system.  To further limit the risk of a banking failure, the government imposed various standards of safety and soundness. These standards range from underwriting loans to maintaining adequate levels of capital and reserves. While these standards make banking safer, they also make it more expensive. It takes time and effort to evaluate the creditworthiness of borrowers. Likewise, money that is set aside in reserves cannot be used to make a loan and earn a rate of return.  As I have outlined earlier, Congress undermined both underwriting standards and capital requirements in an effort to expand home ownership. However, these actions alone would not have likely caused the crisis.  Another major contributing factor was the fact that all of the limits placed on traditional deposit-based commercial banking led to the expansion of the alternative securities-based investment banking system. This system is sometimes referred to as the ``shadow'' banking system. While both types of banks are arguably clouded by a fog of confusion, the differences are very clear.  Investment banks do not accept or create deposits. Instead, they help businesses and governments raise money by selling their stocks and bonds to investors. To accomplish this goal, they also perform two other important functions. They transform stocks, bonds, or mortgages into securities. This securitization process is designed to diversify the investments and reduce market risk. Many investment banks also serve as market-makers.  Just as a commercial bank must meet a depositor's demand for cash, a market-maker must buy securities for cash. However, there are two important differences. Unlike deposits that must be redeemed $1-for-$1, securities are redeemable at the market-price, which could be more or less than the amount originally paid. The other important difference is that investment banks do not have an established government safety net.  They do not have access to deposit insurance because they do not have deposits. They do not typically have the ability to borrow from the central bank as the lender of last resort, again because they do not have deposits. Nevertheless, when they lose the confidence of their customers, they are subject to the equivalent of a bank run.  That is basically what happened. Investment banks borrowed short term, primarily through repos, and invested long term, primarily in mortgage-backed securities. When it finally became apparent to everyone that mortgage default rates were going up and home prices were going down, the short-term lending came to an end. Without the ability to borrow more short-term money or sell long-term securities at their original price, the investment banks faced insolvency.  This was not our first crisis, and it won't be our last. Increased transparency and accountability are necessary, but they are not sufficient. A sound financial system requires a sound monetary policy. That means a strong and stable dollar.  The history of U.S. monetary policy, indeed the history of monetary policy around the world, reveals an ongoing effort to devalue money through endless inflation.  The reform we need most is to overcome the temptation to purchase prosperity with inflated dollars. Until that goal is achieved, I am afraid the current reform effort will amount to little more than rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1 President Harry S Truman Message to the Congress on the State of the                     Union and on the Budget for 1947                            January 21, 1946                        National housing program       Last September I stated in my message to the Congress that      housing was high on the list of matters calling for decisive      action.       Since then the housing shortage in countless communities,      affecting millions of families, has magnified this call to      action.       Today we face both an immediate emergency and a major      postwar problem. Since VJ-day the wartime housing shortage      has been growing steadily worse and pressure on real estate      values has increased. Returning veterans often cannot find a      satisfactory place for their families to live, and many who      buy have to pay exorbitant prices. Rapid demobilization      inevitably means further overcrowding.       A realistic and practical attack on the emergency will      require aggressive action by local governments, with Federal      aid, to exploit all opportunities and to give the veterans as      far as possible first chance at vacancies. It will require      continuation of rent control in shortage areas as well as      legislation to permit control of sales prices. It will      require maximum conversion of temporary war units for      veterans' housing and their transportation to communities      with the most pressing needs; the Congress has already      appropriated funds for this purpose.       The inflation in the price of housing is growing daily.       As a result of the housing shortage, it is inevitable that      the present dangers of inflation in home values will continue      unless the Congress takes action in the immediate future.       Legislation is now pending in the Congress which would      provide for ceiling prices for old and new houses. The      authority to fix such ceilings is essential. With such      authority, our veterans and other prospective home owners      would be protected against a skyrocketing of home prices. The      country would be protected from the extension of the present      inflation in home values which, if allowed to continue, will      threaten not only the stabilization program but our      opportunities for attaining a sustained high level of home      construction.       Such measures are necessary stopgaps--but only stopgaps.      This emergency action, taken alone, is good--but not enough.      The housing shortage did not start with the war or with      demobilization; it began years before that and has steadily      accumulated. The speed with which the Congress establishes      the foundation for a permanent, long-range housing program      will determine how effectively we grasp the immense      opportunity to achieve our goal of decent housing and to make      housing a major instrument of continuing prosperity and full      employment in the years ahead. It will determine whether we      move forward to a stable and healthy housing enterprise and      toward providing a decent home for every American family.       Production is the only fully effective answer. To get the      wheels turning, I have appointed an emergency housing      expediter. I have approved establishment of priorities      designed to assure an ample share of scarce materials to      builders of houses for which veterans will have preference.      Additional price and wage adjustments will be made where      necessary, and other steps will be taken to stimulate greater      production of bottleneck items. I recommend consideration of      every sound method for expansion in facilities for insurance      of privately financed housing by the Federal Housing      Administration and resumption of previously authorized low-     rent public housing projects suspended during the war.       In order to meet as many demands of the emergency situation      as possible, a program of emergency measures is now being      formulated for action. These will include steps in addition      to those already taken. As quickly as this program can be      formulated, announcement will be made. Last September I also      outlined to the Congress the basic principles for the kind of      decisive, permanent legislation necessary for a long-range      housing program.       These principles place paramount the fact that housing      construction and financing for the overwhelming majority of      our citizens should be done by private enterprise. They      contemplate also that we afford governmental encouragement to      privately financed house construction for families of      moderate income, through extension of the successful system      of insurance of housing investment; that research be      undertaken to develop better and cheaper methods of building      homes; that communities be assisted in appraising their      housing needs; that we commence a program of Federal aid,      with fair local participation, to stimulate and promote the      rebuilding and redevelopment of slums and blighted areas--     with maximum use of private capital. It is equally essential      that we use public funds to assist families of low income who      could not otherwise enjoy adequate housing, and that we      quicken our rate of progress in rural housing.       Legislation now under consideration by the Congress      provides for a comprehensive attack jointly by private      enterprise, State and local authorities, and the Federal      Government. This legislation would make permanent the      National Housing Agency and give it authority and funds for      much needed technical and economic research. It would provide      additional stimulus for privately financed housing      construction. This stimulus consists of establishing a new      system of yield insurance to encourage large-scale investment      in rental housing and broadening the insuring powers of the      Federal Housing Administration and the lending powers of the      Federal savings and loan associations.       Where private industry cannot build, the Government must      step in to do the job. The bill would encourage expansion in      housing available for the lowest income groups by continuing      to provide direct subsidies for low-rent housing and rural      housing. It would facilitate land assembly for urban      redevelopment by loans and contributions to local public      agencies where the localities do their share.       Prompt enactment of permanent housing legislation along      these lines will not interfere with the emergency action      already under way. On the contrary, it would lift us out of a      potentially perpetual state of housing emergency. It would      offer the best hope     and prospect to millions of veterans and other American      families that the American system can offer more to them than      temporary makeshifts.       I have said before that the people of the United States can      be the best housed people in the world. I repeat that      assertion, and I welcome the cooperation of the Congress in      achieving that goal.                                  ____                               Exhibit 2                   [From Mises Daily, Mar. 24, 2010]The Federal Reserve as a Confidence Game: What They Were Saying in 2007                           (By Mark Thornton)       In February of 2004, I published an article entitled      ``Greenspam.'' The general lesson was not to listen to      Greenspan's deceptive testimony. Delete it from your mind      like spam email messages. Watch what he has done and what he      is doing, in order to protect your wealth and capital.      Discount anything you read about his testimony, except      Congressmen Paul's questions and commentary.       This talk will be a follow up to that article. I will      describe central banking as a confidence game. The Federal      Reserve plays a confidence game with us. A confidence game      (also known as a bunko, con, flimflam, hustle, scam, scheme,      or swindle) is defined as an attempt to defraud a person or      group by gaining their confidence. The victim is known as the      mark, the trickster is called a confidence man, con man, or      con artist, and any accomplices are known as shills.      Confidence men exploit human characteristics such as greed,      vanity, honesty, compassion, credulity, and naivete. The      common factor is that the mark relies on the good faith of      the con artist.       Here I will concentrate on the Fed's basic confidence game      of trying to gain and maintain our confidence in its system      and getting us to not take proper precautions against the      negative effects of its policies.       Inflation is surely a scam and part of the confidence      game--printing up money and lowering the value of all dollar-     denominated assets while simultaneously benefitting political      friends and accomplices is surely a fraud that could be      classified as a confidence game. This is even more true      because when the people finally lose confidence in the Fed      system and realize what the Fed has been doing, the game will      be up, the dollar will go down, and the Fed will come to an      end!       There are some more basic aspects of the fraudulent nature      of the Fed that I will not address here, Is the Fed a      ``conspiracy''? This is an aspect that is probably addressed      most fully by the G. Edward Griffin book, The Creature from      Jekyll Island. Or is the Federal Reserve just a cover for a      banking cartel? This question has been fully addressed in the      works of Murray Rothbard.       We will set aside some other fraudulent issues with the      Fed. Issues like, why hasn't the nation's gold supply been      audited in decades? Why hasn't the Fed itself been properly      audited? And has the Fed been manipulating the gold market or      surreptitiously leasing out the nation's gold supply? I      suppose all of these issues are related to the basic general      con game, but they are not necessary to make our general      point here today.       The basic focus here will be on the Fed's mission to      instill confidence in us about the economy while      simultaneously instilling confidence in us about the      abilities of the Fed itself. The first mission is easy to see      because Fed officials are almost always publically bullish      and hardly ever publically bearish about the economy. The      economy always looks good, if not great. If there are some      problems, don't worry, the Fed will come to the rescue with      truckloads of money, lower interest rates, and easy credit.      If things were to get worse, which they won't, the Fed would      be able to respond with monetary weapons of mass stimulation.       All this is consistent with the viewpoint of mainstream      economists who see the business cycle as caused by      psychological problems and random shocks. In their view, it      is your fault for becoming overly speculative and risky and      then lapsing into risk aversion and depression. It is your      fault!       I will also limit my analysis in terms of time. When the      subject of this talk was first constructed--so many months      ago--the only reason it was limited to 2007 was because that      was the period just prior to the onset of the current crisis.      The crisis finally revealed itself in 2007. With all the data      at their disposal, surely the Fed would have been alerting      the people to prepare for what was to come. In fact, we could      probably pick any time frame and find the consistently      bullish sentiment expressed by the establishment community. I      had no particular statements or testimony in mind when the      title of the talk was chosen, only the conviction that the      ``confidence game'' was a consistent and dependable part of      how the Fed operates.       I also limit my analysis to the leading officials of the      Federal Reserve. It is, after all, their game. However, we      could also extend the investigation and dependably find      similar statements and testimony from other government      officials from the Treasury Department and White House, as      well as the advocates and promoters of malinvestments from      Wall Street and the real-estate complex. What I will do here      is to cut and paste their words and present the relevant      highlights from their speeches. Predictably, their testimony      and speeches are highly nuanced and hedged.                                Bernanke       ``Central Banking and Bank Supervision in the United      States.''--Speech given at the Allied Social Science      Association Annual Meeting, Chicago, January 5, 2007.       Let us begin at the beginning of 2007 with the chairman of      the Fed, Ben Bernanke. The former economics professor from      Princeton gave an address to the annual meeting of the      American Economic Association. Bernanke is the first chairman      of the Fed from academia since Arthur Burns. It was Burns who      helped take us off the gold standard. God only knows where      Bernanke is leading us!       In addressing his fellow mainstream academic economists,      Bernanke was unusually bold in describing the Fed's access      and ability to use information and data concerning financial      markets. This knowledge and expertise includes the market for      derivatives and securitized assets. He describes the Fed as a      type of superhero for financial markets. In discussing the      Fed's role as chief regulator of financial markets he makes      powerful claims concerning the Fed's ability to identify      risks, anticipate financial crises, and effectively respond      to any financial challenge.       ``Many large banking organizations are sophisticated      participants in financial markets, including the markets for      derivatives and securitized assets. In monitoring and      analyzing the activities of these banks, the Fed obtains      valuable information about trends and current developments in      these markets. Together with the knowledge obtained through      its monetary-policy and payments activities, information      gained through its supervisory activities gives the Fed an      exceptionally broad and deep understanding of developments in      financial markets and financial institutions. . . .       In its capacity as a bank supervisor, the Fed can obtain      detailed information from these institutions about their      operations and risk-management practices and can take action      as needed to address risks and deficiencies. The Fed is also      either the direct or umbrella supervisor of several large      commercial banks that are critical to the payments system      through their clearing and settlement activities.''       In other words, the Fed knows everything about financial      markets. But it gets worse:       ``In my view, however, the greatest external benefits of      the Fed's supervisory activities are those related to the      institution's role in preventing and managing financial      crises.''       In other words, the Fed can prevent most crises and manage      the ones that do occur.       ``Finally, the wide scope of the Fed's activities in      financial markets--including not only bank supervision and      its roles in the payments system but also the interaction      with primary dealers and the monitoring of capital markets      associated with the making of monetary policy--has given the      Fed a uniquely broad expertise in evaluating and responding      to emerging financial strains.''       In other words, the Fed is an experienced, forward-looking      preventer of financial crises. This is a strong claim given      Bernanke's own abysmal record of forecasting near-term      events.       Chairman Bernanke is infamous on the internet because of      the YouTube video that chronicles his rosy view of the      developing crisis from 2005 to 2007. He denied there was a      housing bubble in 2005, he denied that housing prices could      decrease substantively in 2005 and that it would affect the      real economy and employment in 2006, and he tried to calm      fears about the subprime-mortgage market. He stated that he      expected reasonable growth and strength in the economy in      2007, and that the problem in the subprime market (which had      then become apparent) would not impact the overall mortgage      market or the market in general. In mid-2007 he declared the      global economy strong and predicted a quick return to normal      growth in the United States. Remember, Austrians were writing      about the housing bubble, its cause, and the probable      outcomes as early as 2003. Possibly the worst of Bernanke's      statements occurred in 2006, near the zenith of the housing      bubble and at a time when all the exotic mortgage      manipulations were in their ``prime.'' This was the era of      the subprime mortgage, the interest-only mortgage, the no-     documentation loan, and the heyday of mortgage-backed      securities. The new Fed chairman admitted the possibility of      ``slower growth in house prices,'' but confidently declared      that if this did happen he would just lower interest rates.       Bernanke also stated in 2006 that he believed that the      mortgage market was more stable than in the past. He noted in      particular that ``our examiners tell us that lending      standards are generally sound and are not comparable to the      standards that contributed to broad problems in the banking      industry two decades ago. In particular, real estate      appraisal practices have improved.''       This, my friends, is what the Fed is all about. Take a      $100-billion budget, thousands of economists and      statisticians, add in every piece of economic data, including      detailed information concerning every major financial firm,      and what do you come up with? They produced consistently      wrong answers, or answers that were designed to maintain the      ``confidence'' of the average citizen.                                Mishkin       ``Enterprise Risk Management and Mortgage Lending.''--     Speech given at the Forecaster's Club of New York on January      17, 2007.       Less than two weeks after Bernanke's address to the      American Economic Association, fellow academic Fred Mishkin,      a governor of the Federal Reserve Board, took the stage at      the Forecaster's Club of New York. A leading mainstream      economist and expert on money and banking, Mishkin addressed      the group on the topic of ``Enterprise Risk Management and      Mortgage Lending.''       He begins,       ``Over the past ten years, we have seen extraordinary run-     ups in house prices . . . but . . . it is extremely hard to      say whether they are above their fundamental value. . . .      Nevertheless, when asset prices increase explosively, concern      always arises that a bubble may be developing and that its      bursting might lead to a sharp fall in prices that could      severely damage the economy. . . .       The issue here is the same one that applies to how central      banks should respond to potential bubbles in asset prices in      general: Because subsequent collapses of these asset prices      might be highly damaging to the economy . . . should the      monetary authority try to prick, or at least slow the growth      of, developing bubbles? I view the answer as no.''       In others words, if the Fed is not worried, you shouldn't      be either.       ``There is no question that asset price bubbles have      potential negative effects on the economy. The departure of      asset prices from fundamentals can lead to inappropriate      investments that decrease the efficiency of the economy.''       In other words, there are some theoretical problems with      bubbles. But Mishkin has a theory that says there can be no      such things as bubbles.       ``If the central bank has no informational advantage, and      if it knows that a bubble has developed, the market will know      this too, and the bubble will burst. Thus, any bubble that      could be identified with certainty by the central bank would      be unlikely ever to develop much further.''       He then tells his listeners that in the unlikely event of a      bubble, it really would not be a problem:       ``Asset price crashes can sometimes lead to severe episodes      of financial instability. . . . Yet there are several reasons      to believe that this concern about burst bubbles may be      overstated.       To begin with, the bursting of asset price bubbles often      does not lead to financial instability. . . .       There are even stronger reasons to believe that a bursting      of a bubble in house prices is unlikely to produce financial      instability. House prices are far less volatile than stock      prices, outright declines after a run-up are not the norm,      and declines that do occur are typically relatively small. .      . . Hence, declines in home prices are far less likely to      cause losses to financial institutions, default rates on      residential mortgages typically are low, and recovery rates      on foreclosures are high. Not surprisingly, declines in home      prices generally have not led to financial instability. The      financial instability that many countries experienced in the      1990s, including Japan, was caused by bad loans that resulted      from declines in commercial property prices and not declines      in home prices.''       Boy, I bet he would like to take back his words today.      Everything he just said turned out to be untrue; and he      should have known that all of the assumptions he used to      quell fear and instill confidence were simply not true.       ``My discussion so far indicates that central banks should      not put a special emphasis on prices of houses or other      assets in the conduct of monetary policy. This does not mean      that central banks should stand by idly when such prices      climb steeply. . . .       Large run-ups in prices of assets such as houses present      serious challenges to central bankers. I have argued that      central banks should not give a special role to house prices      in the conduct of monetary policy but should respond to them      only to the extent that they have foreseeable effects on      inflation and employment. Nevertheless, central banks can      take measures to prepare for possible sharp reversals in the      prices of homes or other assets to ensure that they will not      do serious harm to the economy.''       In other words, the Fed likes bubbles. Mishkin says the Fed      is prepared to protect us from the bursting of the bubble,      but obviously he was wrong on that point too. Of course the      issue of the Fed causing bubbles is never broached, and if it      is, Fed officials will chime in to squash any such notion.                                  kohn       ``Financial Stability: Preventing and Managing Crises.''--     Speech given at the Exchequer Club Luncheon, Washington, DC.      February 21, 2007.       Fed Vice Chairman Donald L. Kohn downplayed the possibility      of a crisis but said,       ``In such a world, it would be imprudent to rule out sharp      movements in asset prices and deterioration in market      liquidity that would test the resiliency of market      infrastructure and financial institutions.       While these factors have stimulated interest in both crisis      deterrence and crisis management, the development of      financial markets has also increased the resiliency of the      financial system. Indeed, U.S. financial markets have proved      to be notably robust during some significant recent shocks.''       In other words, just thinking about crises makes them less      likely.       ``The Federal Reserve, in its roles as a central bank, a      bank supervisor, and a participant in the payments system,      has been working in various ways and with other supervisors      to deter financial crises. As the central bank, we strive to      foster economic stability. As a bank supervisor, we are      working with others to improve risk management and market      discipline. And in the payments and settlement area, we have      been active in managing our risk and encouraging others to      manage theirs.''       In other words, the Fed will deter any crisis.       ``The first line of defense against financial crises is to      try to prevent them. A number of our current efforts to      encourage sound risk-taking practices and to enhance market      discipline are a continuation of the response to the banking      and thrift institution crises of the 1980s and early 1990s.''       ``Encourage sound risk-taking practices''--did I hear that      right?       ``Identifying risk and encouraging management responses are      also at the heart of our efforts to encourage enterprise wide      risk-management practices at financial firms. Essential to      those practices is the stress testing of portfolios for      extreme, or ``tail,'' events. Stress testing per se is not      new, but it has become much more important. The evolution of      financial markets and instruments and the increased      importance of market liquidity for managing risks have made      risk managers in both the public and private sectors acutely      aware of the need to ensure that financial firms' risk-     measurement and management systems are taking sufficient      account of stresses that might not have been threatening ten      or twenty years ago.''       In other words, the Fed's number one job is to prevent      ``extreme'' events--or was that, to cause such events?       ``A second core reform that emerged from past crises was      the need to limit the moral hazard of the safety net extended      to insured depository institutions--a safety net that is      required to help maintain financial stability. Moral hazard      refers to the heightened incentive to take risk that can be      created by an insurance system. Private insurance companies      attempt to control moral hazard by, for example, charging      risk-based premiums and imposing deductibles. In the public      sector, things are often more complicated.''       I guess they are! In other words the Fed must refrain from      bailing out markets or it will encourage risk and      speculation.       ``The systemic-risk exception has never been invoked, and      efforts are currently underway to lower the chances that it      ever will be.''       Well, I think that record has now been broken--into several      trillion pieces.                                Kroszner       ``Recent Innovations in Credit Markets.''--Speech given at      the Credit Markets Symposium at the Charlotte Branch of the      Federal Reserve Bank in North Carolina, March 22, 2007.       Fed Governor Randall S. Kroszner was the Fed's number-one      guy in terms of regulation of financial markets. He was the      point man in preventing things like systemic risk, but he      considered all this financial ``innovation'' and      ``engineering'' to be a good thing:       ``Credit markets have been evolving very rapidly in recent      years. New instruments for transferring credit risk have been      introduced and loan markets have become more liquid. . . .      Taken together, these changes have transformed the process      through which credit demands are met and credit risks are      allocated and managed. . . . I believe these developments      generally have enhanced the efficiency and the stability of      the credit markets and the broader financial system by making      credit markets more transparent and liquid, by creating new      instruments for unbundling and managing credit risks, and by      dispersing credit risks more broadly. . . .       The new instruments, markets, and participants I just      described have brought some important benefits to credit      markets. I will touch on three of these benefits: enhanced      liquidity and transparency, the availability of new tools for      managing credit risk, and a greater dispersion of credit      risk.''       What he then goes on to discuss are ``recent developments''      such as credit default swaps (CDS) of which the ``fastest      growing and most liquid'' are credit-derivative indexes      involving such things as packages of subprime residential      mortgages. He says that ``Among the more complex credit      derivatives, the credit index tranches stand out as an      important development.''       He goes on to state that, historically, secondary markets      were illiquid and nontransparent (banks held their own      loans!). Now liquidity has improved and transparency has      improved. This promotes better risk management as risk is      measured and priced better because market participants have      better tools to manage risk. The result has been a ``wider      dispersion of risk.''       ``On its face, a wider dispersion of credit risk would seem      to enhance the stability of the financial system by reducing      the likelihood that credit defaults will weaken any one      financial institution or class of financial institutions.''       Yes, there are some concerns, but most of these concerns      are ``based on questionable assumptions.'' Yes, there is      risk, but it's the risk that has been out there all along;      now we can trade this risk among ourselves. There is      ``nothing fundamentally new to investors . . . credit      derivative indexes simply replicate the sort of credit      exposures that have always existed.'' Plus, remember that      this risk is greatly diminished because lenders require      borrowers to put up collateral.       What Kroszner has failed to realize is that by allowing      institutions to disperse their risk, the regulators have      encouraged and allowed for a huge increase in the aggregate      amount of risk. When banks kept their own loans on their own      books, they were careful to make prudent loans, but with      nearly free money available from the Fed, they wanted to make      more loans, and the only way to do that is to make riskier      loans. They didn't want to hold the risky loans so they      ``dispersed'' them.       Kroszner told his audience that the market already      experienced a surprise in May of 2005, but that since that      time much energy has been expended by market participants to      improve risk management.       We don't have to worry, Kroszner tells us, because Gerald      Corrigan is in charge of making sure nothing goes wrong.      Corrigan--a former president of the New York Fed and a      managing director in the Office of the Chairman of Goldman      Sachs--has been in charge of a private-sector group that      controls ``counterparty risk management policy'' for the      financial industry.       ``Cooperative initiatives, such as [this one led by      Corrigan] can contribute greatly to ensuring that those      challenges are met successfully by identifying effective      risk-management practices and by stimulating collective      action when it is necessary. . . . The recent success of such      initiatives strengthens my confidence that future innovations      in the market will serve to enhance market efficiency and      stability, notwithstanding the challenges that inevitably      accompany change.''       Checking ahead, we find Kroszner still bullish later that      same year.       ``Risk Management and the Economic Outlook.''--Speech given      at the Conference on Competitive Markets and Effective      Regulation, Institute of International Finance, New York.      November 16, 2007.       ``Looking further ahead, the current stance of monetary      policy should help the economy get through the rough patch      [yes, he called it a rough patch] during the next year, with      growth then likely to return to its longer-run sustainable      rate. As conditions in mortgage markets gradually normalize,      home sales should pick up, and homebuilders are likely to      make progress in reducing their inventory overhang. With the      drag from the housing sector waning, the growth of employment      and income should pick up and support somewhat larger      increases in consumer spending. And as long as demand from      domestic consumers and our export partners expand, increases      in business investment would be expected to broadly keep pace      with the rise in consumption.''       Over the next year, the Dow would lose 6,000 points; we      have now doubled the amount of unemployment, adding more than      7 million unemployed. Consumer confidence hit a 27-year low      this week, and sales of new homes hit the lowest level in a      half a century--the lowest level on record! Kroszner, an      economist groomed by the Institute for Humane Studies, has      since returned to the University of Chicago and the      directorship of the George Stigler Center.                               Conclusion       We can see that the Fed is a confidence game. Their public      pronouncements, while heavily nuanced and hedged, uniformly      present the American people with a rosy scenario of the      economy, the future, and the ability of the Fed to manage the      market. Ben Bernanke told Congress this week that we are in      the early stages of an economic recovery. Of course, he has      been saying that since the spring of 2009 (if not earlier).      These are the people who said that there was no housing      bubble, that there was no danger of financial crisis, and      then that a financial crisis would not impact the real      economy. These are the same people who said they needed a      multitrillion dollar bailout of the financial industry, or we      would get severe trouble in the economy. They got their      bailout, and we got the severe trouble anyways. It is time to      bring this game, this confidence game, to an end.
