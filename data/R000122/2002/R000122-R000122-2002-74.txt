President, I rise today to join my colleagues, Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts and Senator Bingaman of New Mexico, in introducing this timely and important legislation. The Preservation of Antibiotics for Human Treatment Act of 2002 will address a critical public health concern facing our nation.  There has been mounting scientific evidence that the overuse in animal husbandry of certain antibiotics is increasing the resistance to those antibiotics of bacteria that cause human disease. In farming, the drugs are often added to the feed of healthy animals to promote growth and productivity.  In 1997 and again in 2000, the World Health Organization recommended that antibiotics used to treat humans should not be used to promote animal growth, though the drugs could still be used to treat sick animals. Most developed countries, other than the United States and Canada, restrict the use of antimicrobials in growth promotion.  In July 1998, the National Academy of Sciences concluded in a report that there is a link among the use of antibiotics in food animals, the development of bacterial resistance to these drugs and human disease.  Our legislation will require that an animal drug in the fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin, and an other critical drug, such as penicillin and tetracycline, will be considered unsafe as an additive in animal feed unless the drug's manufacturer can demonstrate that use in animal feed of the drug does not pose a harm to human health. In addition, the legislation will require that the Food and Drug Administration refuse to approve a veterinary drug application for any antimicrobial drug critical to human health care. For drugs that are currently added to animal feed, the legislation will require that the drug's use be phased out over the next two years.  It should be noted that three large commercial poultry producers have recently volunteered to significantly reduce or stop the use of antibiotics in their healthy chickens. In addition, the New York Times reported in February that the industry is stopping the use of a particular drug that is related to Cipro, which is used to treat anthrax in humans. The Times reported as well that some corporate consumers including McDonalds, Wendy's and Popeye's are refusing to buy chicken treated with that drug.  Some will be concerned that our legislation may impose a heavy burden on family farmers. As a means to reduce any burden, the legislation will also authorize payment to producers of livestock or poultry that substantially reduce there nontherapeutic use of antimicrobials in animal feed. Family-owned and family-operated farms or ranches will get priority in the awarding of these payments. And while we understand the concerns of those farmers, we anticipate that the legislation will be a significant step in helping the public health system maintain an effective arsenal against serious diseases, including anthrax, sepsis, strep and salmonella, many of which result in serious illness or death in both children and adults.                                 ______                                       By
