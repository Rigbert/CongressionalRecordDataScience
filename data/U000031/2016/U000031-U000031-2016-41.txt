Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  The simple truth is that we are in the midst of a real epidemic. Nearly every 12 minutes, someone in America dies of a drug overdose. The CDC reports over a quarter billion opioid prescriptions were written in the year 2012. The abuse of prescription painkillers and heroin has impacted, virtually, every single community. It is an epidemic that has no boundaries and does not discriminate. In my State of Michigan, we are seeing 10 times as many deaths today as there were 15 years ago. Sadly, the number continues to surge; but behind every statistic is a person who was loved, part of a family and community, and, yes, who was lost too soon.                              {time}  1045  It is a frightening reality, but we have to face this epidemic head on, and today's vote is an important step forward. Since the beginning of this process, our focus has been, and continues to be, on attacking this public health crisis from every side, from zeroing in on treatment for addiction and overdoses to reforming prescription practices in the delivery of medicines and working with law enforcement of the Department of Veterans Affairs.  Specifically, this conference report addresses prevention care by requiring HHS to create an interagency task force to address chronic and pain management care and by reauthorizing NASPER, a piece of legislation the House has passed with very large bipartisan support.  The conference report addresses treatment by ensuring opioid reversal medication is accessible to patients, their family members and, yes, first responders as well. These medications are key to stopping the overdose epidemic and getting these patients into proper treatment to become productive members of our society.  The conference report also ensures proper oversight and accountability by including the majority leader's OPEN Act.  The conference report, as a whole, touches on the spectrum of issues driving the opioid crisis. While there is no one solution, we are making progress in addressing a problem that has rapidly grown.  So I want to thank all my colleagues--certainly on the Energy and Commerce Committee that I chair and those off--for working to advance these important bipartisan bills that will make a real difference in our communities.  I am also proud that our final package has achieved the support of over 200 of the Nation's leading advocacy groups, groups from across the country that are focused on recovery. These advocates are on the front lines in this epidemic and truly appreciate the positive impact that our solutions will have in every community.  There is an urgency to our work as drug overdose deaths surge in Michigan and beyond. We owe this effort to the past, present, and, sadly, future victims of the opioid epidemic; our neighbors, friends, family across every part of the family in every demographic group. So let's come together and get the job done. What we are doing will save lives.  I reserve the balance of my time.
