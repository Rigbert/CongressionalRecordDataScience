 President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous consent the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following treaty, transmitted to the Senate on October 28, 2003, by the President of the United States: Protocol Amending Tax Convention with Sri Lanka (Treaty Doc. 108-9).  I further ask that the treaty be considered as having been read the first time; that it be referred, with accompanying papers, to the Committee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and the President's message be printed in the Record.
