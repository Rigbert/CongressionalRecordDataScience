Boy Scout Troop 623 is among the oldest in the nation with the earliest records reporting a December 1919 founding, only three years after Congress chartered the national organization.  While the United States is home to many accomplished and dedicated Boy Scout Troops, Troop 623 remains among the most distinguished. The Troop has weathered several difficulties including a 1931 fire that destroyed their camp on Lake Madron. The camp was rebuilt during difficult economic times and has thrived ever since. Camp Madron is still among the finest Scout camps in the United States.  In the summer of 1961, Boy Scout Troop 623 became the first troop from West Michigan to serve as the Governor's Honor Guard and Ft. Mackinac guides when they took the first of their annual weeklong trips to Mackinac Island. The summer of 2010 will mark the 49th consecutive trip the troop has taken, making Troop 623 the longest serving troop in the state. This trip is the highlight of a scout's career.  Scouting is a tremendously rewarding activity, something which I have learned firsthand from my time as a Troop 623 Scout. For the hundreds of former members of Troop 623, their experiences with Scouting have equipped them to become responsible citizens and leaders in the communities that they now call home. The values learned as a Scout are irreplaceable, and the lives of those who have Scouting training bear tribute to their training.                          ____________________
