President, I am pleased and honored to join with my colleagues to introduce two pieces of legislation to help meet the child care challenges facing families around the Nation. These bills entitled the ``Caring for Children Act'' and ``A Boost for Child Care Act'', or the ABC's Act.  Child care, in the home when possible and outside the home when both parents work, goes right to the heart of keeping families strong. Unfortunately, finding quality, affordable child care is one of the most pressing problems for families in Kansas and around the country. It is estimated that quality child care can cost as much or more than college tuition in some areas.  The ``Caring for Children Act'' and `A Boost for Child Care Act'' take the first steps in addressing this challenge through a responsible approach. This legislation expands child care opportunities without increased government costs or intrusion in our lives. This legislation builds into the existing network adding more government intervention or mandates. This legislation will help families that have two working parents and families that have a stay-at-home parent. This legislation will help to increase the supply of quality child care.  First, in order to provide additional tax relief and increased affordability of child care, the ABC's Act expends the Dependent Care Tax Credit by raising the income level to $30,000 at which families become eligible for the maximum tax credit. This legislation also raises the maximum percentage of child care expenses that parents can deduct to 50 percent. These changes make the Dependent Care Tax Credit more realistic for families that face increasing child care costs. Additionally, the ABC's Act accelerates and makes permanent the child tax credit at $1,000 for qualifying taxpayers in order to further ease the financial burden on families.  Increasing the income level and the percentage of child care expenses that are deductible will help families where both parents work. But, we must also recognize that families who choose to have one parent remain at home have child care expenses as well. Therefore, this legislation extends eligibility for the Dependent Care Tax Credit to families with a stay-at-home parent. This provides greater options to more families and leaves child care choices where they should be--with the family. In order to target this credit to parents who need it the most and meet our fiscal responsibilities, the credit is phased out for higher income wage earners.  The ``Caring for Children Act'' recognizes that small businesses play a critical role in providing child care options to millions of working parents. Unfortunately, small businesses generally do not have the resources required to start up and support a child care center. This legislation includes a short-term flexible grant program to encourage small businesses to work together to provide child care services for employees. This program is more of a demonstration project that will sunset at the end of three years. In the meantime, small businesses will be eligible for grants up to $100,000 for start-up costs, training scholarships, or other related activities. Business must continue to meet state quality and health standards. Businesses will be required to match Federal funds to encourage self-sustaining facilities well into the future.  Parental access to child care information and technical assistance to child care providers both play a strong role in increasing the supply of quality child care. The Caring for Children Act includes a grant program to allow entities to develop and operate technology-based child care training infrastructures to enable child care providers to receive the training, education and support they need to improve the quality of child care. The legislation also provides funds for the Department of Health and Human Services to collect and disseminate state of the art information on topics related to child care health and safety, as well as early childhood development. This information could be distributed through brochures, the internet, a toll-free information hotline, or resource and referral organizations.  Child care is an issue that impacts each and every one of us. While parents continue to struggle to meet the constant demand of work and family, we must continue to do our part to expand child care options and protect our nation's most valuable resource, our children. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues in this important effort.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the ``Caring for Children Act'' and ``A Boost for Child Care Act'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 388       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
