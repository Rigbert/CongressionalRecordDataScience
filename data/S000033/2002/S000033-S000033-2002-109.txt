 Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to inform you about a very important and exciting Town Meeting for Young People that I held at the University of Vermont on Monday, April 8, 2002. This meeting brought young people together from all over the state of Vermont to discuss some of the most pressing issues facing our country. Fifteen high schools and youth organizations and about 100 students attended this all day event and provided some excellent and well-researched testimony that I intend, at a later date, to enter into the Congressional Record. I want to thank UVM President Edward Colodny for welcoming the students to UVM, and I want to thank the University for their hospitality. I also want to thank Professor Huck Gutman for spending the entire day with the students and me and doing an excellent job in flushing out their ideas.  Let me at this time mention to you who was at the event and some of the topics that they addressed. Let me also suggest that other Members might be interested in putting on similar events in their congressional districts. The young people of this country have a lot to say, and I think that it's important for members of Congress to listen to them.  Following are the names of the students who participated in the Town Meeting and their schools or youth organizations: Jessica Walters and Falinda Hough from the Lund Family Center discussed problems relating to Teenage Drinking; Dan Hill from YouthBuild Burlington discussed Affordable Housing issues; Becca Van Hrn, Eli Brannon and Sam Parker from Proctor High School talked about ``Free Trade not being Fair Trade''; Lee Goldsmith, Greg Howard and Robby Short from Mt.

Too often, in my view, the media focuses on the problems facing young people. As a nation we do not pay enough attention to the hard and constructive work being done by millions of students and their teachers all across our nation. Let me conclude by thanking all of the young people and their teachers for their participation.                          ____________________
