President, I join the Senator from Utah. We will now know anytime the Democrats are told they are not doing their job it will be coming straight from the Senator from Utah.  Senator Abraham is very fortunate to have her there. Senator Abraham is a good friend to all of us here, and she has been a good friend to all of us here. He is fortunate. I will do my best to fill in and help the chairman on some of these issues, especially as I know we can finish this bill in 2, 2\1/2\ days, so long as the leadership does not interrupt us for anything else.                          ____________________
