 President, my amendment extends critically needed Medicare provisions for all of 2010, not just part of it. It replaces the provisions that are not fully offset with fully offset provisions, and it adds an additional 3 months for the physician update through the end of 2010. This amendment draws additional funds from the Medicare improvement fund to ensure these provisions are fully offset.  My friend from Montana said that is not the place to take the money from, but his substitute amendment takes money from the very same fund. I take a little bit more, yes, but I don't think a few billion in funding needed here will make much of a difference when it comes to the $2.5 trillion cost of health care reform, as was suggested earlier. So I don't see that as a valid argument for not paying for these Medicare provisions.  Going back to the situation at hand, the 30-day extension that passed last night only prevents payment cuts until the end of March. Physicians and Medicare beneficiaries need to have certainty and be ensured access to care. This is the fiscally responsible way to pay for these important Medicare provisions.  We need to pass this very essential amendment now, so I urge my colleagues to support it.
