 Speaker, as my colleagues may know, tragically millions of American citizens cannot afford the outrageously high costs of prescription drugs in this country. Some of these people die, others suffer, and still others take money from their food budgets or other basic necessities of life to buy the life-sustaining drugs that their doctors prescribe.  Tragically, and I think many of us are fully aware of this now, citizens of the United States pay by far, not even close, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. Some of us have taken our constituents across the Canadian border, others have gone over the Mexican border and have found, for example, that tamoxifen, a widely-prescribed breast cancer drug, sells in Canada for one-tenth of the price, one-tenth of the price that it sells in the United States. And this is for women who are struggling for their lives.  But it is not only Canada that has lower prescription drug prices. For every $1 spent in the United States for a prescription drug, those same drugs are purchased in Switzerland for 65 cents, the United Kingdom for 64 cents, France for 51 cents, and Italy for 49 cents. Meanwhile, year after year the pharmaceutical industry appears at the top of the charts in terms of profits. Last year, for example, the ten major drug companies earned $26 billion in profits while millions of Americans are unable to afford the products that they produce.  Now, why is it that prescription drugs in this country are so much more expensive than they are in any other industrialized country? I think the answer is obvious. The pharmaceutical industry is perhaps the most powerful political force in Washington and has spent, unbelievably, over $200 million in the last 3 years on campaign contributions, on lobbying, and on political advertising.                              {time}  1900  Amazingly, the drug companies have almost 300 paid lobbyists knocking on our doors in Washington, D.C. to make certain that Congress does not lower the cost of prescription drugs, and to make certain that their profits remain extraordinarily high.  Year after year senior citizens throughout this country and those with chronic illnesses cry out for prescription drug reform and lower prices, but their cries go unheeded as the pharmaceutical industry and their lobbyists defeat all efforts to lower prices.  This year it is my hope and my expectation that it is going to be different and that we are finally going to succeed, not only in passing a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, but lowering prescription drug costs for all people.  Last year this Congress in a bipartisan manner passed legislation that promised the American people that they would be able to buy prescription drugs at the same low prices as consumers in other countries through a drug reimportation program. In the House, the Crowley reimportation amendment won by the overwhelming vote of 363-12. Unfortunately, at the end of a long legislative process, loopholes were put into the amendment that made it ineffective. While the law remains on the books, it has not been implemented by either the Clinton administration or the Bush administration.  In an increasingly globalized economy where we import food and other products from all over the world, it is incomprehensible that pharmacists and prescription drug distributors are unable to import or reimport FDA safety approved drugs that were manufactured in FDA approved facilities.  Mr. Speaker, tomorrow as part of the agriculture appropriations bill, the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley) and I will introduce essentially what the Crowley bill was that passed overwhelmingly last year.  Despite huge opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, I am confident that Congress will stand up and vote to begin the process to lower prescription drug costs in this country.  As Dr. David A. Kessler, former FDA Commissioner under President Bush and President Clinton stated in support of reimportation last year, ``I believe U.S. licensed pharmacists and wholesalers who know how drugs need to be stored and handled, and who would be importing them under the strict oversight of the FDA, are well-positioned to safely import quality products rather than having American consumers do this on their own.'' That is Dr. David Kessler.  Mr. Speaker, I hope tomorrow will win an overwhelming victory for prescription drug consumers in this country.                          ____________________
