President, today, we are continuing to debate the Republican leader's bid for what I believe is one-party rule through his insistence to trigger the nuclear option. It is kind of a ``king of the hill'' situation. While playing king of the hill, you say ``might makes right,'' but it doesn't; it makes wrong in this case. Through the misguided efforts to undercut the checks and balances that the Senate provides in our system of government, it is the need to protect the rights of the American people, the independence and fairness of the Federal courts and, of course, minority rights in the Senate.  Our time would be much better used if we were doing something about the dramatic rise in the price of gasoline over the past 5 years, or the enormous and unprecedented increase in the national debt during the past 5 years; or what has happened when we have seen the huge budget surplus that former President Clinton left his successor, which has now turned into the largestbudget deficit in the lifetime of anybody in this Chamber.
