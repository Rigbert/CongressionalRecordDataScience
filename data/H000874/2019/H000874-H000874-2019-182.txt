Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.  On Tuesday, the House will meet at 12 p.m. for morning-hour debate, and 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes postponed until 6:30 p.m.  I remind Members that is Tuesday, not Monday. We will not be in session on Monday.  On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate and 12 p.m. for legislative business.  On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. Last votes of the week are expected no later than 3 p.m.  We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules, including H.R. 1595, the SAFE Banking Act of 2019, as amended. The complete list of suspension bills will be announced by the close of business today.  The House will consider H.R. 2203, the Homeland Security Improvement Act, and H.R. 3525, the U.S. Border Patrol Medical Screening Standards Act. These bills will improve how the Department of Homeland Security oversees border issues in a humane and responsible manner, including the care of children.  Members are of course advised that there is additional legislation that may come forward.
