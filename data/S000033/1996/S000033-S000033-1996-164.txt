 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by five Champlain Valley Union High School students, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people:       John: We'd like to first have all the people out in the      audience who are going to attend college to stand up right      now. All right. Whoever can pay off college by themselves,      without any assistance from the government, or the college,      please keep standing. Anyone who requires any kind of      financial aid, please sit down. Okay, I see one person out in      the audience that can afford college.       Okay, that's what's happening around the country right now,      is that people of our generation cannot afford college. The      cost of many colleges are approaching $30,000. People just      can't afford that.       I know in my personal experience, I'm going to a college      that costs $28,000; my mom works full-time as a teacher, and      she only makes $26,000. Without financial aid of any sort,      going to my college of choice would be impossible. And the      U.S. is unique in this fact, in that almost all of its young      and brightest citizens end up being in debt, be it $30,000 or      even $100,000. This really isn't right.       Ben: And in today's society, having a college education is      a must. Anyone that expects to succeed needs to have a      college education. You've heard the facts already, that the      males that go to college are 50% higher than high school      graduates, and without the funding of student aid and good      financial packages from colleges, it's impossible for our      generation--for us, for any of us--to really make any      contribution to our nation. And we're in strong support of      raising student aid to normal people, not just the people      that really need it, in the lower class, but in the middle      class, where you won't qualify for the financial aid that you      need. But yet, you cant' afford to pay it yourself. John's      got a graph that talks about how income has risen, and the      cost of college has risen also.       (John got up with graph) As you can see, the bar on top is      the Median* Household Income for families in U.S. (1980-     2000;) and at the bottom is the cost of 4-year colleges      across the board. (*taken from U.S. Census Bureau) And the      gap . . . ends up being about $10,000; and $10,000 is not      enough for a family, the moderate American family, to live      on. You also have to count taxes in that, and taxes slash the      American family income by about \1/3\. This means that the      families have little or no income after paying for college.       Ben: And one of our resolutions is that as a student, you      get a loan from the government, and in order to pay back the      loan that the government gives, is by doing work for the      government itself, in the field that they study. So, for      instance, I want to study Journalism in college. Well, the      government would give me a certain amount that would help pay      for college that would lessen the burden on myself for paying      it. A board would decide how long a person would have to      work, say it would be 4 years for the government, or      whatever, in that special range, working with public      relations and communications, and so on and so forth. We      believe that could work, and it very well can work. Also, we      just read in the Globe about how President Clinton is      (signal) working on doing . . . for every student in top 5%      in the high school graduating gets a $1,000 merit      scholarship. That's good, but it's not enough. Each student,      by need, has to have the necessity to make this country      better, and without a proper education, it's not going to get      any better.       John: One of the best things, in addition to loans, is      federal financial aid, is to make all college costs      deductible from your taxable income, so that--the family will      have more disposable income, and can write-off more income,      so they pay less taxes while sending their kids to school.      Hopefully this will encourage more people to go to school.      The government will get the money back in the long run, so      it's not like it's hurting the budget that much.       Congressman Sanders: Okay. Thank you for your testimony.      Let me ask you a couple of questions. Given the problems that      you've articulated, what is your understanding as to what      Congress is doing right now to address those problems?       Answer: Well the Republican-controlled majority in Congress      has not been very forgiving of . . . the cost of college;      they believe     that balancing the budget is more important than keeping our      young people afloat, and going to college. They've been      really selfish in that.       Congressman Sanders: Let me ask you another question. We      have heard from a number of the panelists today a great      concern, and it was interesting to see so many people stand      up, and say, ``Yes, we are going to need help from the      government or from some other source in order to go to      college.'' Given that reality, is it your judgment that the      students themselves have been effective politically in      fighting for more federal aid to education. Have they done as      good job in making their concerns known to their elected      officials?       Answer: I think a lot of them are not really at an age to      make an impact, because of their age, they're not old enough      to vote, and really vote for the candidates that will help      raise the financial aid. President Clinton is trying the best      he can, but with the Congress being so closed-minded in some      respects, we don't really have a say.                          ____________________
