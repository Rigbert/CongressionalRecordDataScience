I would like to ask the Senator if he would be kind enough to help me understand some of the elements.  When President Bush first took office, he invited a bipartisan group of Democrats and Republicans to come to the White House to talk about setting national goals for education. I thought it was a very positive conversation and dialog.  I know the Senator has been working with those on the other side of the aisle as well as the White House to come up with new ideas when we deal with education, whether it is accountability standards, testing, or improving teacher skills and the like. But I wish the Senator from Massachusetts would be kind enough to tell us how these ideas which are part of the better education for students and teachers are affected directly by the funding levels because as I listen to the Senator's discussion on the floor today, he is suggesting that the ideas may be good ideas but, if they are not funded, too few children will profit from them. If we are talking about values for American families, certainly we can't ignore two-thirds of our children and only help a third of them.  Can the Senator give us some idea whereas this lack of funding will have a direct impact on the education children receive in America?
