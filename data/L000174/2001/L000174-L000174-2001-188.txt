The answers are not back. For all we know, they may have been mailed in to the Judiciary Committee office. We don't know.  As the Republican leader knows, we have been somewhat stymied moving papers around here. But this is one where a Senator had asked a question. I notified Senator Hatch. I thought it would be a lot easier to get the questions answered than to bring the name up. Once they are answered, I expect the nominee to go through easily. That follows the tradition our committee has followed for 25 years under both Republicans and Democrats. If they have a question, we put them on the docket, I hope the question would be answered, and she would be on the next Exec.  I hope we will get back into our offices so we can find out if that material is there.
