Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Riverside, California are exceptional. Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent to making their communities a better place to live and work. Carole A. Gudde is one of these individuals. After a year of exemplary service, we salute Carole as the outgoing Chairman of the Board for the Greater Riverside Chambers of Commerce.  As one of the oldest, largest and most influential chambers in the state, the Greater Riverside Chambers of Commerce (GRCC) works closely with local government and other entities to stimulate development and improve the quality of life in Riverside County. Carole Gudde's vision, leadership and ability to work with others have continued the mission of the GRCC in its work to promote economic development and pro-actively address problems within the community. The GRCC is approximately 1,600 members strong and Carole has been instrumental in maintaining and adding members to the Chamber.  Carole's efforts as Chairman of the Board have extended beyond the boundaries of Riverside and into the State Capitol and Washington, DC. She has been actively involved in advocating pro-business legislation and fighting against measures that would put strains on local small business. She consistently kept members informed of the happenings in Sacramento as well as Washington, DC and made sure that Riverside's voice was heard.  Carole has also been instrumental in promoting quality education for our children. Carole is also a member of the Executive Council of the Riverside Community Hospital, the YMCA Professional Business Women's Association, and the A. Gary Anderson School of Management Forum. She has been a recipient of the Small Business Eagle Award, 1996 Volunteer of the Year Award, and was named a ``Woman of Distinction'' by the Business Press in 1998. She is also the owner of Archive Management Service in Riverside.  Carole's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Riverside, California. Carole's involvement in the community and on behalf of the local businesses makes me proud to call her a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for her service and salute her as she exits as the Chairman of the Board for the Greater Riverside Chambers of Commerce.                          ____________________
