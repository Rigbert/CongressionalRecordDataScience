Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to my friend and colleague, the distinguished Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, Bill Archer. Few legislators have the opportunity in their careers to effect such far-reaching reforms as the gentleman from Texas has during his time in this body, particularly his years as Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.  As we all know, the Committee on Ways and Means carries a very heavy legislative load, dealing each and every year with 100 percent of our nation's revenues. Bill Archer has taken this responsibility very seriously since becoming Chairman in 1994, and his accomplishments reflect this.  First and foremost, Bill Archer left his mark on legislative history with his work on the Balanced Budget Act of 1977. Among it's many provisions, the Balanced Budget Act gave Americans the first tax cut in 16 years. It also helped taxpayers by shifting the burden of proof on tax issues from the taxpayer to the Internal Revenue Service. Taxpayers received new rights and protections in their dealings with the Internal Revenue Service, and the Internal Revenue Service in turn became subject to the oversight of an independent agency.  However, reforming the Internal Revenue Service is not Bill Archer's only legacy. He also fought hard and successfully for welfare reform which has resulted in millions of former welfare beneficiaries leaving the welfare roles and moving back into the workforce. In addition, he has worked toward meaningful Social Security reform, and we know that the groundwork he laid will help us realize that goal effectively.  Bill Archer's legislative accomplishments speak volumes about his integrity, dedication, and commitment. These are the characteristics that have led his constituents to send him back to Washington 15 times. These same characteristics are the ones we, his colleagues, will miss most when Bill Archer retires. I join all Bill Archer's friends and colleagues in thanking him for his many years of service and wishing him the best of health and happiness in the years to come.                          ____________________
