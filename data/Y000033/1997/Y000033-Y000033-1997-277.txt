Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to offer legislation with the ranking minority member of the Resources Committee, Mr. George Miller. The 104th Congress considered several legislative bills to amend the Indian Child Welfare Act [ICWA], however, none of the legislative measures were enacted into law. In May 1996, the Committee on Resources and I directed the Tanana Chiefs Conference to begin a consultation effort with the American Academy of Adoption Attorneys, National Indian Child Welfare Association, and tribes to draft ICWA legislation.  Last year, tribal representatives met in Tulsa, OK, to reach a consensus to address concerns expressed with the ICWA. This legislation contains identical language which was drafted and agreed to by the Academy of Adoption Attorneys and tribal representatives in H.R. 3828. H.R. 3828 was favorably reported out of the Committee on Resources, however it was not considered by the House in the 104th Congress. This legislation addresses many of the concerns of the adoption of native children by providing notice to tribes for voluntary adoptions, terminations of parental rights, and foster care proceedings. It provides for time lines for tribal intervention in voluntary cases and provides criminal sanctions to discourage fraudulent practices in Indian adoptions. The proposal provides for open adoptions in States where State law prohibits them and clarifies tribal courts authority to declare children wards of the tribal courts. Additionally, it clarifies the limits on withdrawals of parental consent to adoptions. In addition, it states that attorneys and public and private agencies have a duty to inform Indian parents of their rights under ICWA, and provides for tribal membership certification in adoptions. These reforms resolve the ambiguities in current law which resulted in needless litigation, and have disrupted Indian adoption placements without reducing this country's commitment to protect native American families and promote the best interest of native children.  Mr. Speaker, all of the provisions contained in this bill have been tentatively embraced by the Academy of Adoption Attorneys and tribal representatives. My committee will seek additional input from the Department of Justice,the Department of the Interior, and the Department of Health and Human Services. Last year, both the Department of Justice and the Department of the Interior embraced identical ICWA legislation. Additionally, Jane Gorman, the attorney for the Rost family embraced and supported passage of this legislation in the 104th Congress. The Rost case has been a sad and tragic case which was caused by an attorney who tried to cover up the natural parent's tribal membership and purposefully avoided checking with the grandparents and extended family of the children to see if the family was available to adopt these children. The sad part is that this attorney did not violate the law, but he inflicted sorrow on the Rosts, the grandparents of the children, and ultimately on the children themselves. This proposed legislation will impose criminal sanctions on attorneys who violate ICWA requirements in the adoptions of a native child. In closing, I believe we have acceptable legislation which will protect the interests of adoptive parents, native extended families, and most importantly, Alaska Native and American Indian children.                          ____________________
