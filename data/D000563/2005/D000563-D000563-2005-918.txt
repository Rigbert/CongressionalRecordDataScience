In Mississippi, the enforcement of local gun laws is so relaxed and the enforcement of Federal laws is so relaxed that people could literally buy a van full of cheap ``Saturday night specials,'' get on the interstate highways and head north to Chicago, Springfield, and St. Louis, selling those guns on the street.  I ask the Senator from Rhode Island, is there anything in this bill which will make it more difficult for those gun traffickers to buy these guns, turn them loose on the streets to kill innocent people in my State or any State in this country?
