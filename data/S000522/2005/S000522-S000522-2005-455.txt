Mr. Speaker, May 12, 2005, I chaired a Capitol Hill briefing, ``Sex Trafficking in Eastern Europe: Belarus, Moldova, and Ukraine,'' conducted for the Congressional Human Rights Caucus. The Caucus heard testimony from a number of excellent witnesses regarding current efforts in Eastern Europe to combat human trafficking for forced economic or sexual exploitation.  Since the late 1990s, I have worked to eradicate trafficking in the United States and around the world. As Co-Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe and as Special Representative on Human Trafficking for the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), I have given particular attention to the situation in the 55 OSCE participating States, which include source, transit and destination countries for victims of trafficking, such as Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, The United States has been a solid supporter of the OSCE's role in generating the political will--and programmatic responses--necessary to stop trafficking in Europe and Eurasia.  Among those briefing the Congressional Human Rights Caucus was Michele Clark, Head of the OSCE's Anti-Trafficking Assistance Unit in Vienna, Austria, and previously Co-Director of The Protection Project at Johns Hopkins University. Ms. Clark is a dedicated and knowledgeable anti-trafficking advocate. Her recognized expertise on human trafficking issues led to her appointment at the OSCE in which she is now at the forefront of the anti-trafficking movement in Europe.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that Ms. Clark's prepared statement from the briefing be printed in the Congressional Record. Her statement was both visionary and practical and challenges all of us--Members of Congress and representatives of governments alike--to take bold, definitive steps to eradicate modem day slavery. Ms. Clark's statement also encourages us, and I believe rightly so, to evaluate carefully whether our current programs and strategies are effectively meeting that challenge.Testimony of Michele A. Clark, Head, Anti-Trafficking Assistance Unit, Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe: Sex Trafficking in                Eastern Europe: Moldova, Ukraine, Belarus                              Introduction       I am Michele Clark, Head of the Anti-Trafficking Assistance      Unit at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in      Europe (OSCE) in Vienna, Austria. The OSCE has a long history      of combating all forms of human trafficking, including      trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation as well as      forced and bonded labor within the framework of prevention,      prosecution and protection. A unique characteristic of the      OSCE's Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings is      the recognition of human trafficking as a complex,      multidimensional issue with far reaching security      implications. Consequently, the Action Plan enjoins all of      the OSCE institutions and structures, including the Strategic      Police Matters Unit and the Office of the Coordinator for      Economic and Environmental Activities, as well as the Office      for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, to work      together toward combating trafficking in human beings.       I appreciate the opportunity to address you today on the      status of Trafficking in Human Beings in Eastern Europe with      a focus on the countries of Moldova, Belarus and Ukraine. I      would like to thank you, members of the Human Rights Caucus,      for your sustained commitment to this noble cause and for      keeping informed of the most current issues, trends and      challenges. The OSCE looks forward to being of assistance to      you in any way we can, and to continuing our good work      together.       The movement to Combat Trafficking in Persons is poised to      become one of the most significant human rights movements in      the past two hundred years, but it isn't there yet. I say      this very carefully. For, notwithstanding the central      position that human trafficking has occupied on the world      stage for the past five years, the tragic, graphic stories by      print and broadcast media, the high level of political      visibility and, last but far from least, the hundreds of      millions of dollars and Euros made available by donor      countries, trafficking in human beings is in fact a growth      industry. Obviously, this statement begs the question,      ``Why?'' I would like to devote the bulk of my testimony      today to providing some thoughts that might prove beneficial      to policy makers as well as practitioners as we all attempt      to ``get it right.'' I would like to begin with a real-life      story.                            Mariana and Jana       A year and a half ago, I went to Moldova. Although I went      there to participate in an international conference, one of      my personal goals was to visit with a family I had only heard      about, but wanted very much to meet. Four months earlier, the      eldest daughter, a beautiful young woman in her early      twenties and herself the mother of a three-year-old      daughter, tragically killed herself, by hanging in the      country where she had been trafficked, abused, finally      imprisoned as she waited to participate in the prosecution      of her traffickers. I do not apply the word, ``rescue'' to      such circumstances. She worked with the law enforcement      officials of that country and her testimony resulted in a      conviction and stiff sentence. The only option available      to her, at the end of the legal proceedings, was return to      her country, and for that she was asked to pay $80 for her      travel documents. Return to what, however? A job that      would pay about 30 dollars a month? A home without a      father, because hers was absent 8 months of the year, a      migrant worker in Western European countries, trying to      make money to send home? For her daughter, a life with      prospects not much different than her own? Rather than      return to a future with no hope, Mariana as I will call      her now, ended her own life.       Her body was flown to Moldova, where she was buried. An      international organization there as well as an NGO in the      destination country contributed to the transport of the body      and to the funeral costs. I went to see her mother, younger      sister Jana, and her daughter Victoria. We spent many hours      together over several days, but the family did not want to      talk about Mariana--although everyone knew what had happened      to her. The stigma of Mariana's life as a trafficked woman      was a great burden for the family. Coupled with the suicide,      it was too much to bear. There were no visible pictures of      her in the home but I finally asked to see photos. The mother      warmed to us then and for a few moments we all wept together      as women and as friends. All except for little Victoria who      continued to express anger that her mother came home in a box      and that she was not allowed to see her.       In particular, I was deeply moved by the younger sister,      Jana, and became concerned for her future. Blonde (as much as      it pains me, there is a stereotype), bright-eyed and quite      lovely, she asked eagerly about life in the United States and      wondered if I could help her get there. I thought, how easily      swayed she would be by anyone who offered her a situation      similar to her sister's. For weeks her image would not leave      me and I made some inquiries, unwilling to accept that her      plight had to be the same as her sister's. Was there in fact      no hope for her? I learned that a year of university would      cost about $USD 500; she would then need money for supplies      and fees, and income to supplement the money she was making      in a candy factory. I engaged with a social worker there,      part of a large organization that assisted trafficked women.      I asked them, what could happen, and what were the options?      It took a long time to get answers, because the social      workers have very little capacity to assist victims, or      potential victims, to find long-term solutions, the focus      being primarily on emergency care. Finally I was told that      Jana could be sent to hairdressing school, and that she would      receive assistance with job placement after she left.      However, there was no money, not even the small sum $800 that      would take care of all costs. Together with a few friends, we      paid for Jana to go to school, and learn a trade. I was      deeply disappointed at how few options were available and by      the lack of attention to the long term. Parenthetically, I      must say how exasperated I get when I hear that vocational      training for trafficked women consists of beauty school. This      is certainly a fine trade, but how many beauticians can small      countries support? Another important fact is that many of      these women are intelligent and resourceful, and would do      well in business or any of the other professions.       To summarize this story, I would like to quote my colleague      Antonia DeMeo, who is the Human Rights and Senior Anti-     Trafficking officer at the OSCE Mission to Moldova: ``If the      economic situation in Moldova would improve, then I believe      that the trafficking problem would decrease. People are      looking for work and money, and better opportunities for the      future, and will take significant risks to get them. [While      working in the Balkans] I saw numerous asylum and residency      petitions filed by Moldovans and none of them wanted to      return to Moldova. Why? Because they saw no future there.      You can provide them with all the counseling you want--it      will not solve the problem of creating a viable future.                 Characteristics of Countries of Origin       Today we are talking about three different countries:      Moldova, Belarus and Ukraine. I would like to identify common      elements among each of these countries in an effort to assist      our policy and programmatic initiatives.       These three countries are among the top ten countries of      origin for trafficking for     prostitution in the world, according to a United Nations      report dated May 2003. It is interesting here to note that      these countries have all undertaken serious efforts towards      legislative reform to address trafficking in human beings.      Laws alone do not stop trafficking, although they are a      necessary place to start.       These countries share many of the same routes, and many of      the same countries of destination, including but not limited      to Italy, the United Arab Emirates, Germany, Czech Republic,      Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden, Greece, France, Finland, the      Netherlands, Hungary, Poland and the United States.       These countries are primarily countries of origin for women      trafficked for purposes of commercial sexual exploitation.      However, recent studies of trafficking patterns in these      countries indicate new trends, notably trafficking of      children (boys and girls), trafficking for labor, and the      development of local sex tourism. This particular trend is      very unsettling. The sex tourism is a by-product of coveted      commercial development necessary to the betterment of the      collapsing economic infrastructures.       Numbers of trafficked persons are very difficult to come      by, with most information being provided by countries of      destination. Victim identification remains inadequate.       Most trafficked persons return to the same conditions which      initially compelled them to seek employment elsewhere. The      hardship is compounded, however, by the fact that they are      often stigmatized as a result of their trafficking      experiences. Furthermore, criminal status that ensues from      being considered an illegal immigrant, or being in possession      of fraudulent documentation further marginalizes these women      and shuts them out of the formal economy.       Overall, there is a lack of protection and re-integration      programs for returning trafficked persons. Most programs      provide short term assistance only and are not equipped to      provide long-term support to trafficked persons. Failure in      identification of trafficked persons and the subsequent      dearth of long-term assistance appear to be factors which      contribute to re-trafficking.       Each country has experienced a period of great political      instability.          Challenges to Combating Trafficking in Human Beings       I believe that both countries of origin and of destination      have a responsibility for providing protection and assistance      to victims of trafficking, for the plight of women like      Mariana, and to ensure that Jana, and even Victoria, will be      able to contemplate a future with options and possibilities,      much in the way all of us in this room approach the future.       In countries of origin, root causes need to be considered.      These run very deep, and comprise social and economic push      factors that drive women to seek employment overseas,      including the absence of alternatives, the social stigma that      leaves trafficked persons marginalized, and the on-going need      to provide financial assistance to their families. It is also      necessary to consider wide-spread corruption, the lack of a      human rights approach, mistrust towards the police and      judiciary, the absence of a tradition to resolve issues      through court procedures, lack of co-operation between the      State and the civil society, widely spread distrust      towards NGOs as foreign agents and representatives of      political opposition, inadequate funding for the      implementation of anti-trafficking programs and projects,      lack of co-operation with countries of destination. This      list goes on.       Countries of destination, on the other hand,--and this      includes us--will have to concretely recognize that they      create the demand which encourages human trafficking and      enables organized criminal groups to generate billions of      dollars annually in tax-free revenue at the cost of human      misery. Furthermore, countries of destination need to develop      humane and compassionate approaches to victim identification,      victim protection, and long-term victim assistance.      Successful reintegration begins at the country of      destination.       After making this distinction, I personally believe that it      is no longer adequate to talk about solutions, policies and      practices directed exclusively towards countries of origin      and destination, for these countries are in fact linked by      very complex relationships that include financial      institutions, border and immigration police, law enforcement,      the tourist and transportation industry, and other equally      significant commercial and professional enterprises. To      address only a country of origin without looking at where the      reward comes from for criminal activity is an incomplete      approach, and will therefore yield incomplete results.      Regional approaches to combating trafficking in persons,      linking countries of destination and origin, have the best      potential for arriving at comprehensive and systemic      solutions.       In addition to the challenge of complex political and      commercial relationships mentioned above, I would like to      talk briefly about the great challenge of victim      identification, underscoring why there is such urgency in      addressing this topic. From 1 January 2000 to 31 December,      2004, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and      other nongovernmental organizations assisted 1,464      trafficking victims to return to Moldova, and this number      includes 81 minors. In 2004, one destination country alone      documented repatriation of 1,774 Moldovan women. These women      were listed as illegal immigrants; however, human rights      groups in this country attest that the majority of Moldovan      women who are arrested for violations of immigration laws are      victims of trafficking. Similar discrepancies can be found      among the other countries we are talking about. In one year,      one country reported more Moldovan women than other reports      claim were helped in five years. These discrepancies require      our serious consideration. Why the discrepancy? What needs to      be changed in order for women to seek out assistance? Are the      right groups providing the assistance so that trafficked      persons feel protected? Is the assistance appropriate to the      need?                          Policy Implications       Here I would like to ask two more questions:       (1) What about the present? Are we really making progress?      If trafficking, as all indicators tell us, is in fact a      growth industry, then what do we not know? What are we      getting wrong? What in fact is the real impact of anti-     trafficking funding?       (2) What about the future? Are our current efforts helping      to lay a foundation that will enable prevention, protection      and prosecution to continue after donor funds have decreased?       I am particularly concerned about the need to think about      investing in the creation of sustainable grass roots      initiatives as opposed to reactive project development. The      question of funding is of particular concern to me right now.      Wealthy nations have responded generously both by making      funds available and by elevating this issue to one of high      political visibility. But let us be realistic. History      shows us that in time, another world crisis will capture      world attention as well as money, even though human      trafficking itself will not disappear. Will there be      organizations, movements, trained personnel in rural      communities, small towns and big cities who will be able      continue to pressure their governments and work to assist      individuals?       Let us look again at Moldova. This small country with a      population of barely 4 million people is now receiving      between $USD 10M-12M over several years to combat trafficking      in persons. Here are some questions we need to think about,      not only for Moldova, but for all countries receiving large      amounts of external assistance.       To what extent are these funds actually reaching trafficked      persons or developing grass roots capacity?       To what extent are these funds being invested to ensure      sustainable anti-trafficking initiatives?       To what extent is there coordination among donors to ensure      that there are no duplicated efforts?        Who is around the table at these coordinating meetings?      Are the right partners present in order to make sure that      these efforts are able to continue into the future, long      after grant money has decreased?        Are the faith communities involved? It is well known at      this time that faith communities have the capacity to reach      trafficked persons which are normally outside of the grasp of      other organizations; this comes from the fact that they are      closely linked to the communities and have the trust of the      local populations--including the trust of trafficked persons.                            Recommendations       1. Coordinate initiatives of major donors to ensure that      there will be no duplication of efforts, and that there will      be monitoring of grant activities.       Make sure that grants provide for a broad representation of      local NGOs.       Make sure that funded projects ensure provision of benefits      directly to individuals and to the empowerment of small local      NGOs. Many budgets give only token amounts to local      initiatives while having large budgets for travel and foreign      consultants. This is the time to develop the grass roots work      force.       Develop existing capacity and cultivate potential/future      capacity. Are there sufficiently trained service      professionals? Do countries' economic development plans      foresee the training of new members of the work force taken      from returning trafficked persons?       Develop a long-term perspective to finding long-term      solutions rather than only addressing immediate needs.       Give priority to programs that work towards social      inclusion--the forgotten stepchild of the anti-trafficking      movement. Make reintegration a long-term policy.       Members of the Human Rights Caucus, I will end where I      began, challenging us to consider that we could be part of      the greatest human rights movement of the past two hundred      years, with a legacy of freedom, redemption and hope that      will serve as a model for generations to come. Do we have the      courage, the discipline, and the wisdom to make it happen?      May it be so. Thank you.                          ____________________
