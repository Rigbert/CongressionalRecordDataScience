Speaker, I have in my hand a letter. This is not a letter from Democrats. This is a letter from 13 Republican leaders, chairs of the subcommittees of the Appropriations Committee, who say to the budget conference committee: Bring a solution to the floor before the Thanksgiving break and no later than December 2. Yet, ladies and gentlemen of this House, Mr. Speaker--and yes, Mr. Speaker, all of us speak to the American people, who ought to be asking us, Why? Why? Why do we waste time when so much important work remains to be done?  Defeat the previous question. Allow us to offer a resolution which will say to the American people, We will continue to work until we get your work done.                                    Congress of the United States,                                  Committee on Appropriations,                                Washington, DC, November 18, 2013.     Hon. Paul Ryan,     Chairman, Budget Committee,     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.     Hon. Chris Van Hollen,     Ranking Member, Budget Committee,     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.     Hon. Patty Murray,     Chairwoman, Budget Committee,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Jeff Sessions,     Ranking Member, Budget Committee,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Ryan, Chairwoman Murray, Ranking Member      Sessions, and Ranking Member Van Hollen: We call on the      Budget conference to reach an agreement on the FY 2014 and      2015 spending caps as soon as possible to allow the      appropriations process to move forward to completion by the      January 15 expiration of the current short-term Continuing      Resolution. We urge you to redouble your efforts toward that      end and report common, topline levels for both the House and      Senate before the Thanksgiving recess, or by December 2 at      the latest.       If a timely agreement is not reached, the likely      alternatives could have extremely damaging repercussions.      First, the failure to reach a budget deal to allow      Appropriations to assemble funding for FY 2014 will reopen      the specter of another government shutdown. Second, it will      reopen the probability     of governance by continuing resolution, based on prior year      outdated spending needs and priorities, dismissing in one      fell swoop all of the work done by the Congress to enact      appropriations bills for FY 2014 that reflect the will of      Congress and the people we represent. Third, the current      sequester and the upcoming ``Second Sequester'' in January      would result in more indiscriminate across the board      reductions that could have negative consequences on      critically important federal programs, especially our      national defense.       In addition, failure to agree on a common spending cap for      FY 2015 will guarantee another year of confusion.       The American people deserve a detailed budget blueprint      that makes rational and intelligent choices on funding by      their elected representatives, not by a meat ax. We urge you      to come together and decide on a common discretionary      spending topline for both FY 2014 and FY 2015 as quickly as      possible to empower our Committee, and the Congress as a      whole, to make the responsible spending decisions that we      have been elected to make.           Sincerely,         Harold Rogers, Chairman, Committee on Appropriations;            Jack Kingston, Chairman, Subcommittee on Labor, Health            and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies;            Tom Latham, Chairman, Subcommittee on Transportation,            and Housing and Urban Development, and Related            Agencies; Kay Granger, Chairwoman, Subcommittee on            State, Foreign Operations, and Related Agencies; John            Abney Culberson, Chairman, Subcommittee on Military            Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies;            John R.
