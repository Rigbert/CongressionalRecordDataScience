Chairman, I do not know of any amendments to the Ward amendment. I do not know whether the Chairman does or not. But I would, if there are no amendments to it, then I would suggest that we agree with the gentleman from Kentucky [Mr. Ward] that we have 25 minutes on the Ward amendment. I do not know of any amendments, so I do not think it really affects the debate. Am I wrong? Are there amendments that the gentleman from Iowa knows of?
