President, reserving the right to object, on behalf of several Senators on this side of the aisle, I might say the bill that was brought to the floor is a bill which is fatally flawed. It is a bill which would have allowed a parent who was guilty of a crime against his child, a parent guilty of incest, would have been allowed to file a lawsuit against someone trying to help the victim of his crimes. Fortunately, an amendment was considered and unanimously passed here which addressed this fatal flaw in this bill.
