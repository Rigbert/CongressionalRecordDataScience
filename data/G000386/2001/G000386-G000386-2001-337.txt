 President, I appreciate the Senator from Minnesota always speaking strongly for the need to do more for education, but this is not the place for this particular issue. In addition, this motion, if it went into effect, would delay the over $30 billion of tax incentives for education that we already have in this bipartisan bill.  This amendment also is not germane. Consequently, I raise a point of order on the germaneness of this provision on a reconciliation measure and that the amendment will come under section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.
