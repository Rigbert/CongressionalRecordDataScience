 President, today I wish to recognize the 2013 Pride Foundation Scholars--a remarkable group of 89 students who share incredible perseverance, a strong desire to give back, and a focus on how education can improve their lives and their communities.  Pride Foundation plays a crucial role in encouraging and supporting the next generation of leaders in the LGBT community. Students who have been stigmatized because of their sexual orientation or gender identity sometimes do not receive the support they need from their families and communities, and too often, individuals of greatpromise give up on their dreams because they do not believe success is possible.  Over the past 20 years, Pride Foundation has worked to lift up future leaders by giving over $3 million in educational scholarships to LGBT and allied students in Washington, Alaska, Idaho, Montana, and Oregon. They have provided these students with financial support, mentorship opportunities, and a community that focuses on generosity, encouragement, and acceptance. As Pride Foundation marks the 20th anniversary of their scholarship program and honors these students at the 2013 Scholarship Celebration Reception, I wish to congratulate this year's scholars on all their achievements.  Pride Foundation's longstanding determination to help students succeed mirrors the LGBT community's tireless efforts in the fight for equality. And as we commemorate this year's Pride Month, we should look back and celebrate the tremendous strides that we have made toward equality in Washington State and across the Northwest.  I join with many in Washington State in congratulating this year's Pride Foundation Scholars on all they have achieved so far. I look forward to seeing all they will accomplish as leaders in their communities. Although we have a long way to go to move our country in the right direction, working together we have accomplished so much. I am proud to stand up and fight for the LGBT community, and I will continue to make sure that your stories are heard in the Senate. Again, congratulations to the 2013 Pride Foundation Scholars. I look forward to seeing all you will accomplish in the years to come.                          ____________________
