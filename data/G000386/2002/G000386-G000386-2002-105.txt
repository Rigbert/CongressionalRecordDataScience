 Jeffords. I thank him very much for his contribution to that.  It really has probably done as much for Medicare as the prescription drug provisions will, as we look to the day when we have baby boomers going into transition from their employer's health plans to Medicare. There will be a smooth transition if they choose the enhanced option; whereas all the other plans, including the Republican plan in the House of Representatives, including even the President's plan, Medicare will still be a 1965 model. And for baby boomers going from their modernized employer's health plan to the 1965 model of Medicare, if that is the only choice they had, it would not be a very good day for those baby boomers going into retirement.  It has been such a pleasure to work with Senator Jeffords on this whole package, but most importantly, to have his leadership on this part that deals with the enhanced option, the new and improved and strengthened Medicare.
