President, I would like to address two issues that are related. The first issue is the so-called nuclear option. I think many people have read about it and heard about it. I would like to explain, from my point of view, the merits of that issue. Then I would like to address an article which appeared this morning on the front page of the New York Times relative to a meeting which will take place on April 24, sponsored by the Family Research Council, a meeting at which the majority leader of the Senate, Senator Bill Frist, is reported to be scheduled to speak. I would like to address both of those issues and try to make this as direct and concise as I can.  First, let me say there is one thing that binds every Member of the Senate, Republican or Democrat or Independent. There is one thing that brings us together in this Chamber. It is an oath of office. That oath of office, where we stand solemnly before the Nation, before our colleagues, is an oath where we swear to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, this tiny little publication which has guided our Nation and our values for over two centuries.  Though we may disagree on almost everything else, we swear to uphold this document. We swear that at the end of the day we will be loyal to this Constitution of the United States. That, I think, is where this debate should begin, because this Constitution makes it very clear that when it comes to the rules of the Senate, it is the responsibility and authority of the Senate itself to make its rules. I refer specifically to article I, section 5. I quote from the Constitution:       Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings. . .      .  Because of that, most courts take a hands-off attitude. It is their belief that we decide how we conduct business in this Chamber, as the House of Representatives will decide about theirs. That is our constitutional right.  When this Constitution was written, there was a question about whether we could bring together 13 different colonies and they would agree to have one Federal Government. The first suggestion was that we create a House of Representatives with one Congressman for each American person who will be counted. There was, of course, a different system for counting those of color. But when the smaller States took a look at the House of Representatives, they were concerned. They understood in the House of Representatives the larger States would be a dominant voice because they had more people, more Congressmen. The Great Compromise said let us resolve this by creating a Senate which will give to every State, large and small, the same number of Senators--two Senators from each State. So today the State of Rhode Island has the same number of Senators as the State of New York; the State of South Dakota, the same number of Senators as the State of California--the Great Compromise, so the Senate would observe the rights of the minority, the smaller populated States, and give them an equal voice on the floor of the Senate.  The Senate rules were written to reflect that unique and peculiar institutional decision. We said within the Senate, following this same value and principle, that our rules would be written so the minority within the Senate would always be respected. We created something called a filibuster, a filibuster which is unique to the Senate but is consistent with the reason for its creation.  Some of you may remember the filibuster if you saw the movie ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.'' Jimmy Stewart, a brand new Senator, full of idealism, comes to the floor of the Senate and runs smack dab into this establishment of power in the Senate. He decides it is worth a fight and he stands at his Senate desk and starts to speak, and he continues to speak hour after hour until clearly he is about to collapse. But he holds the Senate floor because it was his right to do it as a Senator. As long as his throat would hold up, and other bodily functions, he continued.  We all remember that movie. It spoke to the idealism of the Senate and it spoke to its core values--the filibuster. That is because it was part of checks and balances. It said we are saying to the legislative branch of Government: You are independent, you have your own power, and within that legislative branch you make your own rules. You define who you will be and how you will conduct your business.  We said to the executive branch: We respect you, but you are separate. You don't make our rules; the legislature makes its own rules. The Senate makes its own rules. The House makes its own rules. It is because of that difference, because each branch--the executive with the President, the congressional branch of Government and the judicial branch of Government--is separate and coequal, that we have this great Nation we have today.  It was an amazing stroke of genius that in this tiny publication these Founding Fathers understood how to create a government that would endure.  Think of all the governments in the world that have come and gone since those men sat down in Philadelphia and wrote these words. We have endured. Each and every one of us comes to this floor before we can cast our first vote and we swear to uphold and defend this document and what it contains.  The reason I tell you this is because at this moment there are those who are planning what I consider to be an assault on the very principles of this Constitution. There are those who wish to change the rules of the Senate and in changing the rules of the Senate, defy tradition, change the rules in the middle of the game, and have a full frontal assault on the unique nature of this institution. That, I think, is an abuse of power. I think it goes way too far. It ignores our Founding Fathers. This nuclear option ignores the Constitution. It ignores the rules of the Senate. For what? So the President of the United States can have every single judicial nominee approved by the Senate.  What is the scorecard? How has President Bush done in sending judicial nominees to the Senate? I can tell you the score as of this moment. Since he was elected President, he has had 215 nominees on the floor for a vote in the Senate and 205 have been approved. That is 205 to 10; over 95 percent of President Bush's judicial nominees have come to the floor and been approved. Only 10 have not been approved. They have been subject to a filibuster, part of the Senate rules.  But this White House and majority party in the Senate have decided 95 percent is not enough. They want it all. They want every nominee. Sadly,they are about to assault this Constitution and the rules of the Senate to try to achieve that goal.  This so-called nuclear option is a power grab. It is an attempt to change the rules of the Senate. It is an assault on the principle and value of checks and balances. It is an attempt by the majority party in the Senate to ram through nominees who will not pledge to protect the most important rights of the American people. It is an attempt to say we cannot demand of the President's nominees that each person be balanced and moderate and committed to the goals of ordinary Americans. The fact that the President has had 205 nominees approved and only 10 rejected is not good enough. He wants them all.  This is not the first President in history who has decided in his second term to take on the courts of our country, to say he wanted to put into that court system men and women who agreed with him politically at any cost. The first was one of our greatest Americans, Thomas Jefferson. Full of victory in his second term, he decided to attempt to impeach a Supreme Court Justice who disagreed with him politically, to show he had the political power, having just been re-elected. His efforts were rejected. They were rejected by his own party, his own party in the Senate, who said: Mr. President, we may be part of your party, but we disagree with this power grab.  We are going to protect the constitutional rights and power of our institution of the Senate.  More recently, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt--one of the greatest in our history--as his second term began, became so frustrated by a Supreme Court that would not agree with him, that he sent to the Senate a proposal to change the composition of the Court to make certain that we filled the bench across the street in the Supreme Court with people who were sympathetic to his political agenda. He sent that legislative proposal to a Congress dominated by his political party, by his Democratic Party. What was their response? They rejected it. They said we stood by you in the election, we will stand by your policies, but we will not allow you to abuse this Constitution. We will not allow you to change the rules so you can have more power over our judges. That was the principle at issue. Frankly, Roosevelt lost the debate when men and women of his own party stood up and opposed him in the Congress.  Thomas Jefferson lost the same debate.  Here we go, again. For the third time in our Nation's history, a President, as he begins his second term, is attempting to change the rules of the Senate to defy the Constitution and to give the Office of the President more power to push through judges, to defy the checks and balances in our Constitution.  I don't believe I was elected to the Senate to be a rubber stamp. I believe I was elected and took the oath of office to uphold this Constitution, to stand up for the precedents and values of Congress and our Nation. We need to have, in our judiciary, independence and fairness. We need to have men and women on the bench who will work to protect our individual rights, despite the intimidation of special interest groups, despite the intimidation of Members of Congress. They need to have the courage to stand up for what they believe, in good conscience, to be the rights and freedoms of Americans.  I speak, as a Senator on the Democratic side, and tell you that our 45 Members will not be intimidated. We will stand together. We understand these lifetime appointments to the bench should be subject to close scrutiny, to evaluation, and to a decision as to why they are prepared to serve and serve in a way to protect the rights and aspirations of ordinary Americans.  The filibuster, which requires that 60 Senators come together to resolve the most controversial issues, that rule in the Senate, forces compromise. It forces the Republicans to reach across the aisle and bring in some Democrats when they have very controversial legislation or controversial nominees. It forces bipartisanship--something that tells us, at the end of the day, we will have more moderate men and women who will serve us in the judiciary. Those who would attack and destroy the institution of the filibuster are attacking the very force within the Senate that creates compromise and bipartisanship.  Those who are forcing this nuclear option on the Senate are not just breaking the rules to win, but they want to break the rules to win every time.  Despite the fact that President Clinton had over 60 judicial nominees who never received a hearing and vote when the Republicans were in control of the Senate, this President has only been denied 10 nominees out of 215. We have one of the lowest vacancy rates in the Federal court in modern memory. Yet, they are prepared to push through this unconstitutional and unreasonable change in the Senate rules. It is the first time in the history of the Senate, it is the first time in the history of the United States, that a majority party is breaking the rules of the Senate, to change the rules of the Senate in the middle of the game. I think that is truly unfortunate.  I only hope that some Republican Senators, who value their oath of office and who value this institution, will have the same courage the Democratic Party had when it said to President Franklin Roosevelt: You have gone too far. We cannot allow you to impose your political will on the Supreme Court. They stood up to their President and said our first obligation is to the Constitution, our first obligation is to the Senate.  We will be Democrats after that, but first we must stand behind the Constitution.  I am only hoping that six Republican Senators will stand up, as Thomas Jefferson's party stood up and told him--one of our Founding Fathers--that he was wrong in trying to impose his political will on the Supreme Court and the Federal courts of the land. They had the courage to do it to their President.  How many Republican Senators will stand up to this Constitution and for the values and traditions of this great Senate?  I have a document which I ask unanimous consent be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   History of Filibusters and Judges       Prior to the start of the George W. Bush administration in      2001, the following 11 judicial nominations needed 60 (or      more) votes--cloture--in order to end a filibuster:       1881: Stanley Matthews to be a Supreme Court Justice.       1968: Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court      (cloture required \2/3\ of those voting).       1971: William Rehnquist to be a Supreme Court Justice      (cloture required \2/3\ of those voting).       1980: Stephen Breyer to be a Judge on the First Circuit      Court of Appeals.       1984: J. Harvie Wilkinson to be a Judge on the Fourth      Circuit Court of Appeals.       1986: Sidney Fitzwater to be a Judge for the Northern      District of Texas.       1986: William Rehnquist to be Chief Justice of the Supreme      Court.       1992: Edward Earl Carnes, Jr., to be a Judge on the      Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.       1994: H. Lee Sarokin to be a Judge on the Third Circuit      Court of Appeals.       1999: Brian Theadore Stewart to be a Judge for the District      of Utah.       2000: Richard Paez, to be a Judge on the Ninth Circuit      Court of Appeals.       2000: Marsha Berzon to be a Judge on the Ninth Circuit      Court of Appeals.       Because of a filibuster, cloture was filed on the following      two judicial nominations, but was later withdrawn:       1986: Daniel Manion to be a Judge on the Seventh Circuit      Court of Appeals Senator Biden told then Majority Leader Bob      Dole that ``he was ready to call off an expected filibuster      and vote immediately on Manion's nomination.''--Congressional      Quarterly Almanac, 1986.       1994: Rosemary Barkett to be a Judge on the Eleventh      Circuit Court of Appeals ``... lacking the votes to sustain a      filibuster, Republicans agreed to proceed to a confirmation      vote after Democrats agreed to a daylong debate on the      nomination.''--Congressional Quarterly Almanac, 1994.       Following are comments by Republicans during the filibuster      on the Paez and Berzon nominations in 2000, confirming that      there was, in fact, a filibuster:       ``. . . It is no secret that I have been the person who has      filibustered these two nominations, Judge Berzon and Judge      Paez.''--Senator Bob Smith, March 9, 2000.       ``So don't tell me we haven't filibustered judges and that      we don't have the right to filibuster judges on the floor of      the Senate. Of course we do. That is our constitutional      role.''--Senator Bob Smith, March 7, 2000.       ``Indeed, I must confess to being some what baffled that,      after a filibuster is cut off by cloture, the Senate could      still delay final vote on the nomination.''--Senator Orrin      Hatch, March 9, 2000, when a Senator offered a motion to      indefinitely postpone the Paez nomination after cloture has      been invoked.       In 2000, during consideration of the Paez nomination, the      following Senator was among those who voted to continue the      filibuster:       Senator Bill Frist --Vote #37, 106th Congress, Second      Session, March 8, 2000.
