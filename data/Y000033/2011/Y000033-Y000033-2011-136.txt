Mr. Chairman, may I say there were no facts presented in that last presentation. There were opinions; there were no facts. When everybody says never mind the facts, there were no facts there. That's all opinion.  One thing that bothers me most, they talk about what the oil companies made. They made it overseas; they made it overseas selling us oil. These are international companies. International companies. That is something that really disturbs me, when you understand we're burning oil produced overseas, yes, by the same companies that work in the United States.  And, yes, they did lay off 10,000 people, because of this moratorium this President laid in place in Louisiana in the gulf. There's where the jobs are lost.  The biggest economic impact of the Horizon spill was the loss of employment of the people in Louisiana, Alabama, and the Gulf of Texas, the loss of jobs, loss of oil to this country.  That's the thing that concerns me, because there are no facts about the profits made and the people laid off, other than the fact it was done by the Obama administration.  At this time, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Quayle).
