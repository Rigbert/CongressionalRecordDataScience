President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator Dorgan today introducing legislation which would make it easier for a family to hold onto a small business or farm when the head of the family passes away. I am especially pleased to be joined by Senator Dorgan on this bill as he has been a good friend and colleague for almost two decades and a real leader on small business issues since his election to Congress in 1980.  Mr. President, ownership is a powerful force. Anyone who has gone from renting to owning a home will tell you how much more work you put in as an owner. Suddenly, problems with the plumbing or the roof that used to be the landlord's problems are now your problems. Developments in the neighborhood take on new meaning and you tend to spend more time working with neighbors to figure out ways to make your community stronger.  The trade-off for all this work is that whatever improvements we make to our homes and our communities, they're ours. And if our homes increase in value, we get to keep the difference.  The same is true for small businesses and family farms. Most people who have gone from being an employee to owning a small business or farm will tell you that they work harder as an owner, save more, and take more pride in their work. As with homeowners, small businesspeople and farmers are willing to put in the extra work it takes to run a business because they know it will come back to them in the form of more customers and higher profits. It is this industrious spirit that has defined our nation for more than two centuries and allowed us to enjoy a level of prosperity unknown in any other part of the world, in any other era of human history.  The bill we are introducing today makes a simple change in the tax code that will help families pass down the legacy of business ownership from one generation to the next.  Mr. President, the federal estate tax is one of the most controversial provisions of the tax code. Whatever the merits or shortcomings of the estate tax, I believe most of my colleagues would agree that a family should not have to sell a small business or family farm just because the head of the family passes away. Unfortunately, small business owners face a very real concern that the estate tax may force their families to do just that, particularly families whose business' principal assets consist of machinery, real estate, equipment, and inventory . Those families fortunate enough to avoid selling their business or farm are often frustrated by having to finance their estate tax burden at the expense of needed investments in the business.  Recognizing this problem, Congress worked on a bipartisan basis in 1997 to include provisions in the Taxpayer Relief Act which provide targeted assistance to estates with family-owned businesses and farms. Among its provisions, the Taxpayer Relief Act provided an immediate increase in the estate tax exemption from $600,000 to $1.3 million for estates with businesses that are kept in the family, and improved the terms for installment payments made by estates with businesses by reducing the interest rate from 4 percent to 2 percent for the first $1 million in taxable value of the business in excess of the $1.3 million exemption.  The bill that Senator Dorgan and I are introducing today builds on the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act by simply doubling the $1.3 million exemption for family-owned businesses and farms to $2.6 million. This new level would mean that a typical business with up to 25 employees would face no estate tax liability if the business is kept in the family after the owner dies. Somewhat larger businesses would enjoy a significant reduction in their estate tax burden.  Mr. President, we should be doing what we can to promote small business and farm ownership in America. This bill does just that by simply making it easier for families to continue their tradition of small business ownership. I urge all my colleagues to join Senator Dorgan and me in supporting this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1413       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTIOIN 1.
