President, I have absolutely no objection. In fact, I think it would be a good idea to have the vote on the Helms amendment in an hour and a half, with the time equally divided under control of the managers.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the Helms amendment occur at 6:30 and that the time on the amendment be equally divided in the usual fashion.
