 President, last week, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to approve the bipartisan agreement to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program. On Saturday, on television I saw that the President called our agreement--our bipartisan agreement, I want to emphasize--he called it irresponsible.  Specifically, in his radio address, the President said we ``put forward an irresponsible plan that would dramatically expand this program beyond its original intent.''  Well, I am here to respond to that accusation by President Bush. To callwhat we agreed to as irresponsible is an insult to an agreement we reached and is an insult to 67 Members of the Senate and 265 Members of the House who voted in favor of it.  Calling our bipartisan proposal irresponsible ignores reality.
