President, Senator Gregg and I are trying again to get a finite number of amendments. I appreciate that we have had two amendments that could have gone to rollcall votes. We accepted them and saved time. We have a number of other amendments that fall into that same category. But I guess as the hour goes on, people want to demonstrate how good they are, and if we want to accept it, they want a rollcall vote. I have never been able to figure that out, but that is their right. Of course, it keeps everybody here beyond the time we otherwise would have to be here.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
