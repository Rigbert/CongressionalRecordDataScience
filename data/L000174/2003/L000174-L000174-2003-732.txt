I am sure they do so out of principle. I know they do not relish opposing this nomination. These are organizations, individuals who have devoted their lives to improving the lives of Hispanic members. They worked for decades to increase representation of Latinos on the courts of our country.  It is because of the history and dedicated efforts and deep-seated commitment to the cause of equality for Hispanics I take their views seriously. I understand the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund came to their conclusion after a thorough review of the nomination but also after interviewing and meeting with the nominee.  Yesterday, we received a letter from 15 former presidents in the Hispanic National Bar Association, 15 well-respected national leaders of this important bar association, leaders who date back to the founding of the organization in 1972 have written to the Senate leadership to oppose this nomination. Their weighty opposition is based on the criteria to evaluate judicial nominees this association has formally used since 1991. It has been their standard practice for the past 30 years.  In addition to the candidates' professional experience and temperament, the criteria for endorsement also includes, ``one, the extent to which a candidate has been involved and supported and responsive to the issues, needs, and concerns of Hispanic Americans; and, two, the candidates' demonstration of the concept of equal opportunity and equal justice under law.''  In the view of the overwhelming majority of the living past presidents of the HNBA, Mr. Estrada's record does not provide evidence he meets those criteria. His candidacy falls short in those respects, they say.  Now the Hispanic National Bar Association has been at the forefront of efforts to increase diversity on the Federal bench. They have been at the forefront of the effort to improve public confidence among Hispanics and others in the fairness of the Federal courts. The most important thing in the Federal courts is the fairness, their integrity, their independence.  Time and time again I have asked, both when we have had nominees of Democratic Presidents and Republican Presidents, is this nominee somebody I believe I could walk into the court and be treated fairly? As a Democrat or Republican, whether as plaintiff or defendant, whether rich or poor, white or person of color, no matter what my religion, no matter what my background, would I be treated fairly?  During Democratic leadership of the Senate, we confirmed 100 of President Bush's nominees, and I voted for the overwhelming majority of them. When I was chairman, I moved his nominees through far faster than Republicans ever did for President Clinton when they were in charge, when they averaged only 39 confirmations per year during their six and one-half years of control of the Senate. But I set the same test. Sometimes to satisfy myself of the test I had to go to a hearing that lasted sometimes a day long to be sure. You have a conservative, I want to be sure they will be fair and not too much of an ideologue; the same way I did when I believed someone was too liberal and could be too much of an ideologue. I had to satisfy myself they would be fair.  Now, the HNBA has done the same. They want to make sure the Federal courts are independent and fair. They have supported Republican nominees as well as Democratic nominees. These 15 individuals, all of whom are past presidents of the Hispanic National Bar Association, people who have devoted a great deal of time in their legal careers to advancing the interests of Hispanics in the legal community, have felt compelled to publicly oppose the Estrada nomination.  I regret very much that the White House, instead of seeking someone who would unite the community, has brought in somebody who would divide the community.  Yesterday, Delores Huerta, who cofounded the United Farm Workers with Caesar Chavez, wrote a column in the Oregonian opposing Mr. Estrada's confirmation. I ask unanimous consent this article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:                  [From the Oregonian, Feb. 24, 2003]     Dolores C. Huerta: Estrada Would Destroy Hard-Fought Victories                         (By Dolores C. Huerta)       As a co-founder of the United Farm Workers with Cesar      Chavez, I know what progress looks like. Injustice and the      fight against it take many forms--from boycotts and marches      to contract negotiations and legislation. Over the years, we      had to fight against brutal opponents, but the courts were      often there to back us up. Where we moved forward, America's      courts helped to establish important legal protections for      all farm workers, all women, all Americans, Now, though, a      dangerous shift in the courts could destroy the worker's      rights, women's rights, and civil rights that our collective      actions secured.       It is especially bitter for me that one of the most visible      agents of the strategy to erase our legal victories is being      called a great role model for Latinos. It is true that for      Latinos to realize America's promise of equality and justice      for all, we need to be represented in every sector of      business and every branch of government. But it is also true      that judges who would wipe out our hard-fought legal      victories--no matter where they were born or what color their      skin--are not role models for our children. And they are not      the kind of judges we want on the federal Courts.       Miguel Estrada is a successful lawyer, and he has powerful      friends who are trying to get him a lifetime job as a federal      judge. Many of them talk about him being a future Supreme      Court justice. Shouldn't we be proud of him?       I for one am not too proud of a man who is unconcerned      about the discrimination that many Latinos live with every      day. I am not especially proud of a man whose political      friends--the ones fighting hardest to put him on the court--     are also fighting to abolish affirmative action and to make      it harder if not impossible for federal courts to protect the      rights and safety of workers and women and anyone with little      power and only the hope of the courts to protect their legal      rights.       Just as we resist the injustice of racial profiling and the      assumption that we are lesser individuals because of where we      were born or the color of our skin, so too must we resist the      urge to endorse a man on the basis of his ethnic background.      Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus met with Miguel      Estrada and came away convinced that he would harm our      community as a federal judge. The Mexican American Legal      Defense and Educational Fund and the Puerto Rican Defense and      Education Fund reviewed his record and came to the same      conclusion.       Are these groups fighting Miguel Estrada because they are      somehow anti-Hispanic? Are they saying that only people with      certain political views are ``true'' Latinos? Of course not.      They are saying that as a judge this man would do damage to      the rights we have fought so hard to obtain, and that we      cannot ignore that fact just because he is Latino. I think      Cesar Chavez would be turning over in his grave if he knew      that a candidate like this would be celebrated for supposedly      representing the Hispanic community. He would also be      dismayed that any civil rights organization would stay silent      or back such a candidate.       To my friends who think this is all about politicians      fighting among themselves, I ask you to think what would have      happened over the last 40 years if the federal courts were      fighting against workers' rights and women's rights and civil      rights. And then think about how quickly that could become      the world we are living in.       As MALDEF wrote in a detailed analysis, Estrada's record      suggests that ``he would not recognize the due process rights      of Latinos,'' that he ``would not fairly review Latino      allegations of racial profiling by law enforcement,'' that he      ``would most likely always find that government affirmative      action programs fail to meet'' legal standards, and that he      ``could very well compromise the rights of Latino voters      under the Voting Rights Act.''       Miguel Estrada is only one of the people nominated by      President Bush who could destroy much of what we have built      if they become judges. The far right is fighting for them      just as it is fighting for Estrada. We must fight back      against Estrada and against all of them. If the only way to      stop this is a filibuster in the Senate, I say, Que viva la      filibuster!       Dolores C. Herta is the co-founder of the United Farm      Workers of America.
