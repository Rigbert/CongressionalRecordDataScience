President, I wish to honor an illustrious individual in both Oregon and the Nation's HIV/AIDS research and treatment community who passed away on October 4 of this year. Dr. Jim Sampson, while born a Georgia southerner, made Portland, OR, his home for the past 36 years. As a father, husband, brother, uncle, and friend, Jim generated an inclusive atmosphere of passion, love, and laughter wherever he went. As a medical doctor and a fervent leader in the fight against HIV/AIDS through research and treatments, Jim brought hope and compassion to his daily interactions with colleagues and patients alike. For Jim, no person or job was too big or too small to embrace.  In 1979, after Jim graduated from Emory University and the Medical College of Georgia, he moved to Portland to become the medical director of the health services division and the HIV/AIDS program at Multnomah County Health Department. At a time when a lack of public education and stigmatization of HIV/AIDS stymied research in America, Jim fought to build a greater understanding of the disease. Because of Jim's desire to see HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment improve through extensive research and because of the way he showed love and hope in his interactions with his patients, Jim helped push the doors open wide in the fight against HIV/AIDS.  Over the years, Jim expanded his involvement in the community and the field of HIV/AIDS research and treatment. He would go on to become the chairman of the Oregon Board of Medical Examiners; cofound the Oregon AIDS taskforce; cofound Art AIDS; and sit as executive director and principal investigator at the Research and Education Group, where Jim and his colleagues conducted clinical research. Jim even managed to find time to serve on the board of trustees for the Portland Institute for Contemporary Art and the Pacific Northwest College of Art. Also, over the past 35 years, both Jim and his husband, Geof Beasley, created an unbelievable Sherwood, OR, garden, Bella Madrona, a place where Jim's love of community, advocacy, and family still live on. The Bella Madrona garden has been nationally and internationally recognized, not only for its remarkable beauty, but as the site for many benefits through the years, including human and animal rights, environmental causes, and the arts.  Jim was a valued and loved leader, a healer, and a family man worthy of emulation. With a full and loving heart and an ambitious mindset, Jim selflessly served Oregon and the Nation. While Jim will be remembered by those whose lives he touched, he will especially be remembered as a loving husband and partner of 47 years to Geof Beasley; dedicated father to daughter Adele; and caring brother to sisters, Miriam Tillman and Elizabeth Martin, and brother, George. I honor the esteemed life and career of Dr. Jim Sampson and thank him for his enduring legacy.                          ____________________
