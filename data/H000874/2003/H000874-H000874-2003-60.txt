 million families, the 200,000 military families who would otherwise be eligible, are the ones who are paying the price for the inability of the two Houses to come together when apparently both Houses believe that they ought to get the tax relief of which we speak, and but for the difference on making it permanent, would be getting.  I would again reiterate our hope in the next 2 weeks that we plan on being in session, that if we cannot resolve the differences between the two Houses, we would urge leadership to reconsider that and pass at least the 1- or 2-year extension while we try to reach agreement on the differences that exist between the two Houses.  Mr. Leader, on the FSC bill, it is our understanding that the Committee on Ways and Means will mark up this legislation on Monday. Does leadership expect the bill to be on the floor next week or does leadership expect it to pass before we leave?  Mr. DeLAY. Madam Speaker, the Committee on Ways and Means is considering a markup in the very near future, and once the committee has completed its work, because this bill has been a work in progress and has taken longer than we thought it would take to mark it up in committee, we have not scheduled time for it. But obviously, it is a very important piece of legislation; and once the committee has completed its work, we will look for floor time to move it. But at this point we cannot give an exact prediction of whether it is next week or the following week.
