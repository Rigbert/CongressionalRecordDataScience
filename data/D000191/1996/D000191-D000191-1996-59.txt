Speaker, if my colleagues think the current tax system is fair and equitable, then they will love this amendment. If they like the loopholes and tax giveaways in our Tax Code, they should embrace this constitutional amendment.  Why? Because it will let the special interests and foreign corporations who are now getting a free ride under our loophole-ridden Tax Code stop any reforms from moving through Congress.  Seventy-three percent of the foreign corporations doing business in the United States pay absolutely no Federal corporate income tax. This is a scandal, and the authors of this legislation want to keep it that way. They say that a minority of either the House or Senate should be able to stop tax reform that places a fair tax on foreign corporations doing business in the United States.  Every year foreign corporations mine millions dollars of gold on Federal lands. They pay no royalties to the U.S. Treasury. This bill allows a minority of Members of the House or Senate to stymie any legislation placing a reasonable royalty on mining operations on Federal lands.  The oil and gas industry seems to be doing just fine. Prices are rising at the gas pumps. Profits are up, stocks are increasing in value. Do they really need a $1.5 billion a year Federal tax subsidy? Do we need a constitutional amendment that protects their subsidies? They majority thinks so.  This amendment has been cynically sold as tax relief for average Americans. Nothing could be further from the truth. This legislation makes certain that Members of Congress, whose campaigns are fueled by contributions from the oil industry and a host of other special interests, can protect their tax breaks, subsidies, and loopholes those special interests receive.                              {time}  2100  Make no mistake about it, every dollar that the U.S. Tax Code dishes out in corporate tax loopholes comes straight out of the pockets of working people in this country. This cynical legislation ought to be called the Special Interest Tax Loophole and Corporate Welfare Protection Act. It is a desperate attempt to defend the status quo and make sure that working Americans pay while foreign corporations and special interests play.
