 President, I rise today in honor of Mr. Thomas ``Buddy'' Morgan, the general manager of the Montgomery Water Works and Sanitary Sewer Board in Montgomery, AL. Mr. Morgan serves as their representative to the Association of Metropolitan Sewerage Agencies, AMSA. On May 19, 2030, the members of AMSA elected Mr. Morgan to be the first president of the association from Alabama. Mr. Morgan was selected for his exemplary commitment and dedication to a clean-water community.  AMSA's mission is to effectively maintain a strong leadership role in the development and implementation of scientifically sound, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly policies for the protection of the health of the public and the environment. In May of 2003, AMSA will celebrate 33 years of service to the clean-water community and the Nation.  Mr. Morgan has worked on many projects on behalf of the city of Montgomery. His distinguished background includes his service on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Urban Wet Weather Flows Federal Advisory Committee and the Sanitary Sewer Overflow Federal Advisory Committee. He also served as chair of the Catoma Creek Watershed Committee and as a board member of the Alabama Clean Water Partnership. As a result of his involvement, Montgomery and surrounding areas of the Great State of Alabama are directly represented in national policy discussions.  Mr. Morgan was instrumental in creating the Montgomery County Water Festival, which is now in its third year. As a result of his efforts, the water festival brings together local students for a day of activities and entertainment that instills in them a sense of environmental stewardship and awareness.  Alabama is honored to be the home to Mr. Morgan. It is no secret that he is a man who, day in and day out, goes above and beyond the call of duty. He is to be commended for his extraordinary efforts on behalf of the Montgomery Water Works and Sanitary Sewer Board and his election to lead the Association of Metropolitan Sewerage Agencies.                          ____________________
