President, tomorrow morning we will consider the Defense appropriations conference report with very little debate. It is an important measure. Earlier I came to the floor to speak about one aspect of the bill which relates to drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. It is a large bill, about 1,000 pages. It contains many things. I would like to address the other elements that are included in that bill.  This conference report provides $453 billion in defense spending, money for body armor, armored vehicles, protective equipment for our troops that they need and haven't always had.
