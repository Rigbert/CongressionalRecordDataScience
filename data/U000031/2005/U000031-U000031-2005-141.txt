Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Bronson MethodistHospital in Kalamazoo, Michigan for providing outstanding health care to the residents of Southwestern Michigan. Bronson was recently honored with the 2005 Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, which is our Nation's highest Presidential honor to commend quality and organizational performance excellence.  The 6 recipients of the Malcolm Baldrige Award were selected from a highly competitive field of 64 nation-wide applicants, which were rigorously evaluated by an independent board of examiners.  This prestigious award will come as no surprise to the folks of Southwestern Michigan who have for years relied upon the hard work and treatment provided by Bronson Methodist Hospital. There is nothing more important to us than our health and the health of our family members. I would like to thank Bronson Methodist Hospital for the continued quality service they provide our community and congratulate them once again for being recognized nationally for their hard work and dedication. We are truly fortunate to have such an exemplary hospital working for us in our corner of Southwest Michigan.                          ____________________
