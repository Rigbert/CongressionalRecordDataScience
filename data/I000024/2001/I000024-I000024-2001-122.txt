President, in his recent address to Congress, President George W. Bush made it clear that, unlike his immediate predecessor, he strongly endorses the deployment of an effective missile defense system capable of protecting the United States, its allies and its forward deployed forces from the growing threat of missile attack. As someone who has long viewed the deployment of missile defense as an urgent national priority, I look forward to working with President Bush to achieve this vital national security goal for America.  March 23 marks the 18th anniversary of President Ronald Reagan's historic speech announcing his determination to see America build a defense against ballistic missiles. It is gratifying to know that Reagan's vision remains alive today. As Reagan said in 1983:       What if free people could live secure in the knowledge that      their security did not rest upon the threat of instant U.S.      retaliation to deter a Soviet attack, that we could intercept      and destroy strategic ballistic missiles before they reached      our own soil or that of our allies?       I know this is a formidable technical task, one that may      not be accomplished before the end of this century. . . . It      will take years, probably decades of effort on many fronts.      There will be failures and setbacks, just as there will be      successes and breakthroughs . . . as we pursue a program to      begin to achieve our ultimate goal of eliminating the threat      posed by strategic nuclear missiles.  Now, 18 years later, at the dawn of the new century, a renewed Presidential focus on missile defense is appropriate and necessary. The threat posed by ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction is very real and growing. And as we have seen over time, the technology to begin to meet this threat is available, if we will make the effort to aggressively develop it. Today, President Bush promises to do just that.  Unfortunately, the Clinton administration squandered most of the last 8 years, failing to build a proper foundation for the kind of robust missile defense development and deployment which the growing threat demands. Wedded to the outdated 1972 ABM Treaty, to the superstitions of arms control and to greatly reduced defense budgets, Clinton was consistently hostile to the deployment of effective missile defense. Here is a quick year-by-year review of some of the highlights of the Clinton administration's dismal record on missile defense.  1993: cut $2.5 billion from the Bush missile defense budget request for fiscal year 1994; halted all cooperation with Russia on a joint global missile defense program; terminated the Reagan-Bush Strategic Defense Initiative program; downgraded National Missile Defense to a research and development program only; cut 5-year missile defense funding by 54 percent from $39 billion to $18 billion; reaffirmed commitment to ABM Treaty, saying any defense must be ``treaty-compliant.''  1994: State Department official called the ABM treaty ``sacred text,'' saying ``arms control has more to offer our national security than do more weapons systems. We look first to arms control and second . . . to defenses;'' declared Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) non-treaty compliant; placed self-imposed limits on THAAD testing to keep it ``treaty-compliant.''  1995: Placed self-imposed limits on Navy Upper Tier system to keep it ``treaty compliant;'' politicized National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) to downplay growing missile threat; vetoed Defense Authorization bill requiring missile defense deployment by 2003.  1996: Cut funding and slowed development of THAAD and Navy Theater-Wide systems, in defiance of the law--the Defense Authorization bill--requiring accelerated development; announced fraudulent ``3-plus-3'' program for national missile defense: three years to develop, plus three years to deploy. (Later changed to ``5 plus 3,'' then ``7 plus 3,'' then dropped the ``plus 3''); reaffirmed ABM Treaty as the ``cornerstone of strategic stability;'' opposed and helped kill legislation calling for NMD deployment by 2003.  1997: signed ABM Treaty agreements with Russia which, if ratified by the Senate, would: (1) reaffirm the validity of the ABM Treaty banning effective national missile defense; (2) sharply limit the effectiveness of theater defense systems; and (3) ban space-based missile defenses.  Clinton never submitted these for ratification, knowing they would fail to get the needed 67 votes for ratification.  1998: opposed and helped kill legislation calling for NMD deployment ``as soon as technologically possible;'' disputed the Rumsfield Commission's assessment of the growing missile threat, arguing that there was no need to accelerate missile defense deployment; on August 24, Joint Chiefs Chairman Henry Shelton wrote to me affirming his assurance that U.S. intelligence would detect at least three years' warning of any new rogue state ICBM threat; on August 31, one week later, North Korea surprised U.S. intelligence by testing a three-stage Taepo-Dong I missile with intercontinental range, demonstrating critical staging technology and rudimentary ICBM capability.  1999: delayed by at least two years the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites designed to detect and track missile launches necessary to coordinate with any effective national missile defense system; emasculated the Missile Defense Act of 1999--passed by veto-proof majorities in both houses--calling for deployment ``as soon as technologically possible.'' In signing the bill into law, Clinton outrageously interpreted it to mean that no deployment decision had been made and that therefore he would make no change in his go-slow missile defense policy.  2000: cut funding for the Airborne Laser (ABL) program by 52 percent over 5-year period, but the cuts were later reversed by Congress; allowed Russia to veto U.S. missile defense plans by making NMD dependent on Russia's agreement to modify the ABM Treaty, but Russia would never agree; postponed the administration's long-awaited NMD deployment decision from June to September and then decided to defer any decision indefinitely to the next administration, insuring that the entire eight years of the Clinton presidency would pass without a commitment to deploy national missile defense.  The net result of this abysmal record is that America continues to remain completely vulnerable to missile attack, despite growing threats. In the 8 years of the Clinton administration, there was never a commitment to deploy national missile defense. Instead, there was a misguided ideological dedication to preserving the ABM Treaty, whose very purpose was to prohibit effective missile defense. In essence, the Clinton vision was exactly opposite of the Reagan vision.  Today, the threat grows. Proliferation of missile and weapons technology around the world proceeds at an accelerated pace. Under Clinton, weapons inspectors were kicked out of Iraq; Russia greatly increased its military assistance to China; China was caught stealing U.S. nuclear secrets; U.S. companies were given a green light to help improve the accuracy and reliability of China's nuclear missiles; China transferred missile and weapons technology to North Korea, Iran, Iraq and others; China threatened to absorb Taiwan; and China threatened to attack the United States with nuclear missiles.  The Rumsfeld Commission determined that new ICBM threats could emerge in the future ``with little or no warning.'' The Cox Commission determined that Clinton covered up or presided over some of the most serious security breaches in U.S. history, affecting critical national secrets about virtually every weapon in our nuclear arsenal and numerous military-related high technologies.  The case for missile defense is more compelling today than it has ever been. With a new President determined to set a new course, or rather to set us back to the course first articulated by President Reagan, there is reason for hope and optimism.  I urge President Bush to move quickly in forging a national commitment to the deployment of a robust global missile defense system capable of defending all 50 States, our allies and our forward deployed troops around the world. We should appropriate the necessary budgets. We should exploit all options and technologies. We should seriously consider an initial deployment at sea, using our proven Aegis ships and complementing it with important ground and spaced based systems.  In consultation with our allies, and while maintaining our nuclear deterrent, we should break free of the constraints of the outdated ABM Treaty and begin to fashion a security regime based, as Reagan said, on our ability ``to save lives rather to avenge them.'' This is the legacy America deserves, consistent with Reagan's vision of courage, morality and security--a vision I know is shared by President George W. Bush.                          ____________________
