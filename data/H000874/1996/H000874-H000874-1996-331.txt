Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to John Kabler, one of Maryland's most effective and respected environmental leaders; no one worked harder than John to protect the Chesapeake Bay. As regional director of Clean Water Action, John Kabler showed citizens of Maryland how to work together for a better environment.  John's quiet constructive approach to leadership is well described in a brief tribute published in the New Bay Times. Because we all have much to learn from the way John helped Maryland and the Nation, I would like to share this article with my colleagues and the public.                 [From the New Bay Times, Aug. 8, 1996]                       Appreciation: John Kabler                            (By Joe Browder)       John Kabler's life was about protecting water: assuring      safe drinking water for all Americans; working to save the      Chesapeake and his hometown rivers and streams that nourish      the Bay, restoring the Everglades waters flowing to coastal      south Florida's mangroves and corals and cities. The      difference John made, in these and other issues that help      shape our lives, actually came from his love of life and      people. John loved his family most of all; few persons so      accomplished in public service remain so deeply grounded in      the love of family and friends.       My wife Louise Dunlap and I began working with John in the      '70s and came to know him better through three paths. For      Louise, the intensity of a political campaign during the 1984      presidential primaries and work on the Clean Water Fund's      board. For me, the continuing struggle to protect the      Everglades. For both of us, living in Anne Arundel County and      treasuring every moment spent with John and Sandy.       John took joy from the absurdity and dignity of America's      political process. He relished helping people realize that      they can be powerful when working together. He believed      that citizens, informing themselves and sharing their      knowledge, can and should define the rules that everyone      must play by.       John knew that both nature and neighborhoods are usually      the losers when politicians make deals with polluters. But      John remembered what was worth fighting for, so he understood      that there is no more important struggle than against the      impulse to let ehtier conflict or compromise becomes ends in      themselves. When colleagues would form a circle and fire on      each other, he was kind enough to help all the wounded.       John also believed that so long as the right things happen,      it doesn't matter who appears to be responsible. That's why      John's fundamental role in protecting the Bay was only      recently given wide recognition, when the Governor of      Maryland proclaimed John an Admiral of the Chesapeake.       In the Everglades, John's team demolished the myth about      immigrants' indifference to the environment. Talking with      thousands of households in south Florida, John's Clean Water      surveyors repeatedly found Spanish-speaking families      expressing the highest level of support for protecting the      Everglades and making polluters pay.       When the Everglades was betrayed by the sugar industry's      pet politicians and frustrated citizen leaders turned on each      other or lashed out at government workers, John counseled      better ways. Whether managing small armies or nurturing new      leaders, John guided by teaching and learning.       John experienced what nature gives us, so his work was      founded on understanding what is really to be won or lost. He      believed in justice, for everyone, and saw the connection      between social opportunity and the integrity of nature. He      was awed by the majesty and intricacy of being while loving      people--as a part of life and one person at a time.       John left us as gracefully as he lived with us. He is on      his present journey filled, and filling us, with all the love      a person could hope to give or get.                          ____________________
