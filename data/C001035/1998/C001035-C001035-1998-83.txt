President, there is no conduct less consistent with the precepts of a civilized society than the physical abuse of those unable to defend themselves. Our recognition of this has led to an aggressive and ongoing campaign against child abuse, and it must lead to an equally strong response to domestic violence directed at older Americans. For that reason, I am honored to rise today to cosponsor the Older Women's Protection from Violence Act, legislation introduced by my distinguished colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, and I commend Senator Durbin for his leadership in this area.  Mr. President, at a 1995 hearing in Portland, Maine, chaired by my predecessor, Senator Cohen, elder abuse was aptly described as ``society's secret shame.'' Family violence, particularly when directed at the elderly, was a major concern of Senator Cohen, and I welcome the opportunity to continue his efforts to combat this intolerable mistreatment of older Americans.  Mr. President, earlier this month my home state released its crime statistics for 1997. I was cheered by the wonderful news that crime fell by 8.7% from 1996, to the lowest rate in at least 20 years. Hidden behind this positive statistic, however, was one that was very disquieting, namely, that domestic violence increased by 7.8%. Ironically, at the same time as we are becoming less likely to be harmed by strangers, many of our neighbors face an increasing threat from members of their own households.  National data demonstrate that cases of domestic elder abuse, which includes neglect as well as physical abuse, are steadily increasing. From 1986 to 1996, the number of cases went from 117,000 to 293,000, an increase of 150%. Furthermore, there is widespread agreement that this type of abuse is greatly underreported. For example, although the number of reported cases in 1994 was 241,000, the National Center on Elder Abuse estimates that the true number of cases was 818,000.  Mr. President, while these numbers indicate a serious and growing problem, all of the statistics in the world do not describe the problem as eloquently as the words of a single victim. At the Maine hearing, one such victim told what happened to her at the hands of her husband after her children left home.       [T]hings got really bad. I had two broken wrists, cracked      ribs, held down with his knee on my chest with a knife at my      throat. I was made to crawl across the floor with a gun      resting on my head, ready to fire. I've been choked until I      was limp, and then he would drop me on the floor with a kick.      I've been spit on, thrown through a window, dragged into the      lake as he said he was going to drown me.Astonishingly, but not atypically, the witness was married to her husband for 44 years.  Compounding the physical abuse suffered by elderly victims of violence is the sense of being trapped. Again, one of the witnesses at the Portland hearing described this far more effectively than I can.       People ask why I remained under such circumstances. It was      fear that kept me     there. . . . I had been on an island for eight years. Where      would I go? I had no money, no home, no job, and no credit.      Although I had left good jobs to follow him from job to job,      at age 60 who would hire me? Health insurance was my greatest      concern.With a dependence on the abuser for financial support and physical care, with a long history of emotional ties to that person, with the fear of being held up to ridicule, and with a sense of hopelessness about finding a way out of the predicament, it is hardly surprising that the elderly victim is often reluctant to report domestic assaults.  Domestic violence against older women is a complex problem about which we still lack adequate information. This has led to some erroneous assumptions. For example, it had been thought that assaults against the elderly usually result from caregiver stress, but while this is a factor, its effect now appears to have been overstated. Indeed, according to a recent report, ``[a]busers are not identical in their behavior or their assumptions about abusive conduct.'' As the report points out, this means that a ``cookie cutter'' approach will not solve the problem.  Furhter complicating our efforts to deal with domestic violence against older women are the conflicting feelings and desires of many of the victims. It is quite common for the victim to have a familial relationship with the abuser, and thus, far more is likely to be involved in dealing with these situations that in dealing with an assault committed by a stranger. For understandable reasons, the older woman may want to preserve the relationship while ending the abuse. Finding effective ways to accomplish this can be a formidable challenge.  Mr. President, the legislation that Senator Durbin and I are introducing today recognizes that complex problems defy simple solutions. Thus, the Older Women's Protection from Violence Act does not purport to contain a magic bullet that will eliminate this reprehensible conduct, but rather looks to a multi-faceted approach to address a multi-faceted problem. Similarly, the bill does not offer revolutionary solutions; instead, its message is that the time has come for society to roll up its sleeves and engage in the hard work of protecting those who have contributed so much to our individual and collective well-being.  In keeping with the nature of the problem, the legislation provides for training those who are in a position to identify cases of domestic violence against older women. Consistent with the notion that we cannot stop or correct what we do not discover, the primary recipients of that training would be law enforcement officers and health professionals. In addition, the Attorney General is authorized to make grants to law school clinical programs to include elder abuse cases.  The bill reauthorizes and expands programs that provide services to battered older women. Such services include outreach, support, and counseling. It also enhances their access to domestic violence shelters, something that can mean the difference between life and death in some cases. I should emphasize that the provision of these services will be largely at the local level, with financial assistance from the federal government.  Mr. President, in a prior position, I managed a state agency that has as one of its principal mandates that protection of Maine people, many of them elderly, from fraud and other financial abuses. Thus, I am especially pleased that in addition to addressing violence against older women, this bill seeks to shed light on a problem affecting the elderly that has received even less attention, namely, their financial exploitation by a caregiver or family member.  Two cases discussed at the Maine hearing illustrate my point. In one, an elderly gentleman from southern Maine went without food because his two nephews were stealing his money. Yet, he refused to send them away because they were ``family.'' In the second case, a 75-year old eastern Maine woman returned from the hospital after a severe stroke to find that her daughter and son-in-law had changed the locks on her house. The physical and emotional impact of the experience was so great that she was unable to undertake the legal battle to reclaim her home.  This bill will shed light on this type of abuse by requiring the Secretary of the Treasury to conduct a study of the nature and extent of financial exploitation of older individuals. Our society simply cannot allow our senior citizens who have labored hard to build up a nest egg to have it wrongfully taken from them a the time they need it most.  Mr. President, interest in elder abuse did not begin in our country until the late 1980s, long after we began to focus on child abuse in the 1960s. This may be because these cases are among the least likely to be reported. It may also be because our culture tends to worship youth, perhaps giving our older citizens the sense that we care less about them. In any case, this must change, not only because of demographic trends, but also because it is right.  This bill will contribute to that change by dealing specifically with domestic violence against older women. In addition to providing services to the victims of this conduct, it funds research into various aspects of the problem to enhance our understanding and improve our ability to respond. Our secret shame must not remain a secret.  Mr. President, in 1996 the average age of elder abuse victims was 78. There can be no justification for letting these older Americans, who have reached the point in life where they deserve peace, comfort, and respect, to be the victims of domestic violence or any other form of abuse. This bill is designed to prevent that, and I trust that my colleagues will support us in the effort.                                 ______                                       By
