Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  No relationship to NAFTA? I heard it early on the floor. The United States has entered into an agreement to ship $20 billion to Mexico. We are propping them up through the Bank for International Stabilization, the International Monetary Fund.  How much taxpayer money is at risk? No relationship to NAFTA? This is all about the failed NAFTA, and a bunch of people trying to cover their derrieres because the things we predicted would come about if we entered into this agreement have come about.  What authority was used to enter into this agreement? Never before in the history of the Economic Stabilization Fund, 60 years, has this kind of credit been extended to a foreign power. In fact, when it was first suggested by the Republican leadership to the administration that they use the Economic Stabilization Fund they said it was impossible. It was only later that the administration switched its position.  What terms? Twenty billion dollars. How much of the BIS money is our money? How much of the IMF money is our money? How much are the U.S. taxpayers on the line in this backdoor bailout?  What security? The oil security, the oil funds that are already totally pledged by the company that has no money even to make capital investments because they are so oversubscribed to meet other obligations in Mexico? That is security?  Who benefits? We need the names of each and every business and individual who receives a disbursement that is related to these bailout funds. The American taxpayers have that right.  We will begin to answer some of those questions, only begin with this resolution of inquiry. We must go further. We need to restrict the use of this fund in the future to supporting the U.S. currency and the interests of the United States of America, not foreign authoritarian regimes that are creating billionaires and disasters south of our border.
