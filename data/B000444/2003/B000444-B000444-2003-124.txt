 President, along with Senator Mikulski, I offer the following sense of the Senate amendment with respect to condemning violence against women. It states that the United States should continue to:     condemn violence against women and should urge states to      refrain from invoking any custom, tradition or practice in      the name of religion or culture as a means to avoid      obligations regarding the elimination of violence against      women referred to in Article IV of the Declaration on the      Elimination of Violence against Women.  In this year's session of the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women, the United States sided with Iran, Pakistan and Sudan in opposing the above language in the final report of the Commission's session.  We ought to wonder why.
