I phrase it slightly differently, but I reach the same conclusion.  If gun dealers--who now have the threat of a civil suit if there has been negligence--are so cavalier in their attitude about guns, selling them to criminals, to straw purchasers, what happens when they are fully immunized or virtually immunized from any type of liability? What happens when they know that no family is going to come in and say, My son or daughter died because of your negligence, and we are going to see if we can take you to court and get something back--we will never get the child back--but something back.  What about the surviving spouse or children who need something to maintain the quality of their life because they have lost their breadwinner?
