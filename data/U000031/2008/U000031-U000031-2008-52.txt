 Bill Number: H.R. 5658.  Account: Research, Development, Test and Evaluation--Army.  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Eaton Corporation.  Address of Requesting Entity: 19218 B Drive South, Marshall, MI 49068.  Description of Request: This request is to provide funding for the final phase of an on-going three phase program between Eaton and the U.S. Army. Eaton Corporation, which produces truck components in Galesburg, Michigan, has successfully worked with the Army over the past several years to develop specialized torque-modifying differentials for the HUMVEE to improve the vehicle safety. Phase I and II of the project was structured to first adapt commercial Eaton side-to-side torque modifying differentials to HUMVEES. These programs have proven very successful in quantitatively demonstrating improved vehicle safety by increasing mobility and stability on rough terrain and drastically reducing vehicle rollovers. Prototype systems will be delivered to the Army for additional testing in May2008. Military-hardened systems will be subsequently designed.  The third and final phase of the program is to develop a front-to-rear transfer case to modulate the driving torque between the front and rear axles. In conjunction with the side-to-side system developed in Phases I and II, this will provide the soldier with the ultimate system for HUMVEE stability and mobility through complete 4x4 active torque management.  Financial Breakdown:  Funding Source Breakdown: Total Phase III project cost: $3,500,000; Federal funds: $2,500,000; Eaton internal funds: $1,000,000; Percent matching funds = $1,000,000  $3,500,000 100 percent = 29 percent.  Allocation of Funds: 15 percent--$375,000--Model hardware function and vehicle maneuvers; 25 percent--$625,000--Materials--modifications to transfer case and addition of differential; 10 percent--$250,000--Preliminary Bench test and vehicle functional tests; 50 percent--$1,250,000--Labor--Design/procure hardware, develop preliminary controls software.  Justification for the use of taxpayer dollars: This program addresses a key military need for tactical wheeled vehicle stability and mobility. The technology will greatly improve soldier safety and survivability and mission effectiveness. Eaton Automotive is a commercial company serving non-military customers. Taxpayer dollars are requested for this program to adapt Eaton commercial technology to military vehicles.                          ____________________
