President, I thank the senior Senator from Alaska for his cooperation and his many helpful suggestions for improving this bill. I have great affection and respect for the senior Senator. I very much appreciate the fact that he is going to support this bill on final passage. That means a great deal to me and will certainly assist us. I look forward to continuing to consult with him as we move through the conference process, and I will tell the senior Senator from Alaska that I am very relieved today to see that he is not wearing his ``Incredible Hulk'' tie but, rather, a very restrained tie from some national museum, I believe. I know that bodes well for the day ending well. Again, I thank the Senator. I very much enjoy working with him.
