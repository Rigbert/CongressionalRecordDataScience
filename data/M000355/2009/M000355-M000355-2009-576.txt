 President, a couple brief observations with reference to what the Democratic leader just indicated. I want to say I appreciate the way in which we are going forward here. When he and I first came to the Senate, the notion that you would pass bills without amendment was foreign to everyone. I think we are getting off to a good start here with a kind of reestablishment of the Senate as it used to operate with amendmentsbeing appropriate. As members of his party said when they were in the minority, the Senate is not the House. I think there is a growing appreciation on both sides of the aisle that we ought not to operate that way.  With regard to the organizing resolution, I agree with the majority leader that we are very close to being ready to move forward on that. It is a difficult process for the two of us, but I think we have gotten close to being at a point of completion, which is, of course, essential to beginning our business.                                  TARP  Now, on another matter, Mr. President, a few months ago some of our Nation's top economic minds came to the Capitol to tell us about an impending crisis. The crisis, of course, was the accumulation of toxic assets at banks here and around the world that threatened to paralyze America's economy, jeopardizing the livelihood of literally millions. Without action, we were told, the Nation faced certain calamity.  For many, the normal impulse would be to let the bad actors who caused this mess face up to their mistakes. But since millions of families and small business owners, who did nothing wrong, were caught up in the errors of the few, we decided, with some degree of reluctance, to approve funding for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, now commonly referred to as the TARP.  Fearful of waste and abuse, Republicans insisted on a number of taxpayer protections. We also insisted on releasing the money in two installments so we could review how the first one was spent before approving the second. Yesterday, a request for the second installment was made. I had an opportunity to talk to the incoming President about that matter yesterday.  Throughout this ordeal, I have not wavered on one basic principle: I voted for the first installment on the condition that it be used to prevent a systemic--a systemic--economic collapse affecting every single American. And I continue to believe this money should be used for the reason it was first approved. The current administration, regretfully, used these funds for the auto industry, a move I opposed. Now congressional Democrats are suggesting more of the same. The American people still do not have assurances that this money will not be wasted or misused to play favorites.  So far, the incoming administration has not said whether it plans to limit the funds to their original purpose or to expand their use to help specific industries. The taxpayers are eager to hear the new administration's plan, and so are Republicans in Congress. We will hear from the incoming administration soon. We will be happy to listen. They will have a receptive, albeit cautious, audience.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
