President, I would like to bring to your attention today the exemplary work and most commendable public service of one or our country's outstanding military leaders, Major General William A. Moorman, the Judge Advocate General of the United States Air Force. General Moorman will be retiring after an especially distinguished military career on May 1, 2002.  General Moorman entered the Air Force in 1971 through the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps program. His early assignments included Richards-Gabaur Air Force Base, Missouri, Yokota Air Base, Japan, HomesteadAir Force Base, Florida, Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, and at the Pentagon here in Washington, D.C. He later served as the Staff Judge Advocate for 12th Air Force and U.S. Southern Command Air Forces, Bergstrom Air Force Base, Texas; as the first Staff Judge Advocate of U.S. Strategic Air Command, Offut Air Force Base, Nebraska; Staff Judge Advocate U.S. Air Forces in Europe, Ramstein Air Base, Germany; Commander Air Force Legal Services Agency, Bolling Air Force Base, Washington, D.C.; Staff Judge Advocate Air Combat Command, Langley Air Force Base, Virginia; and finally his current position as The Judge Advocate General of the United States Air Force, where he serves in the Pentagon.  General Moorman was born and raised in Chicago, and his father and mother, James and Mary Moorman, still reside in its suburbs. General Moorman earned a Bachelor's degree in history and economics at the University of Illinois, and then went on to attend the University of Illinois College of Law. He is a graduate of Squadron Officer School, a Distinguished Graduate of Air Command and Staff College, Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, and a graduate of the National War College, Fort McNair, Washington, D.C. General Moorman is admitted to practice before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, the United States District Court for the Seventh Circuit and the Illinois State courts. His military decorations include the Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit with oak leaf cluster, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal with four oak leaf clusters, and the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for his service in Panama during Operation JUST CAUSE. General Moorman was also recognized as the Outstanding Young Judge Advocate of the Air Force in 1979, winning the Albert M. Kuhfeld Award, and as the Outstanding Senior Attorney of the Air Force in 1992, winning the Stuart R. Reichart Award.  Since 1999 General Moorman has served as The Judge Advocate General of the Air Force. In that capacity, he led and inspired an organization of over 3,000 military and civilian lawyers, paralegals, and support personnel. General Moorman's dynamic leadership, sound judgment, personal and professional integrity and unwavering devotion to duty were instrumental in the successful resolution of numerous difficult issues facing the JAG Department and the Air Force. At the same time, he was a key and trusted advisor to two Air Force Chiefs of Staff who relied on his sound, timely and cogent advice in resolving a host of complex legal and policy issues they encountered as the military leaders of the Department of the Air Force.  A visionary leader, Bill Moorman's tenure as The Judge Advocate General was marked by innovation and an unwavering focus on serving the needs of his Air Force client, wherever and whenever the mission required. From the outset of his assignment as the Judge Advocate General, he set about to leverage technology, particularly the use of electronic media and communications capabilities, and focus the efforts of his Department on a common vision for its evolution in the coming years. He drew upon the collective expertise of his most knowledgeable senior leaders to create several cornerstone publications, including the first ever judge advocate doctrine, and the ``TJAG Vision for the 21st Century.'' These documents articulate a common understanding of the unique and increasingly critical capabilities military legal professionals bring to bear in support of air and space operations and will ensure the momentum his efforts generated continue beyond his tenure.  Another hallmark of General Moorman's leadership was his sustained initiative to maintain the high levels of skill and competency of the legal professionals who comprise the Department. His efforts were instrumental in enactment of legislation authorizing continuation pay for judge advocates, a measure that is reversing a perennial recruiting and retention problem by ameliorating spiraling student loan financial burdens that previously had prevented many of our best and brightest law school graduates from electing to serve in the nation's armed forces.  Perhaps General Moorman's greatest legacy will be his commitment to ensuring the Air Force Judge Advocate General's Department operates in a fashion that seamlessly merges its diverse, traditional fields of practice into the Expeditionary Aerospace Force model. He orchestrated numerous programs to ensure judge advocates are skilled in advising commanders on the application of air and space power across the spectrum of military conflict and also oversaw the creation of a comprehensive guide covering the application of air and space power across the full range of combat and noncombat operations.  In the midst of the tragedy of September 11, his first thoughts turned to care for the injured at the Pentagon. He used his personal van as an ambulance and drove a wounded civilian employee to Arlington Hospital. He then returned to duty and led the remarkable effort to consider the unique legal issues involved in our homeland defense and the global war on terrorism. His efforts during and after the Pentagon attack underscore the force multiplying effect reliable legal counsel will bring to armed conflict in the 21st century.  I ask that you join me, our colleagues and General Moorman's many friends and family in saluting this distinguished officer's many years of selfless service to the United States of America. I know our Nation, his wife Bobbie, and his family are extremely proud of his accomplishments. It is fitting that the United States Senate honors him today.                          ____________________
