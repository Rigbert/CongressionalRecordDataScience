 President, today is an important day for our country. Many Senators took the oath this afternoon--13 for the first time--and the new Republican majority accepted its new responsibility. We recognize the enormity of the task before us. We know a lot of hard work awaits. We know many important opportunities await as well.  I am really optimistic about what we can accomplish. I will have much more to say about that tomorrow. For now, I just want to welcome back all of our returning Members. I want to congratulate the many new ones, and I want to say a word about our colleague from Nevada.  Senator Reid is a former boxer. He is tough. I know he will be back in fighting form soon enough. We all wish him a speedy recovery and I wish him the very best.  To all of you, enjoy the ceremonies today. Tomorrow is back to work.  I yield the floor.
