Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman would yield further, I want to say to the gentleman that he and I have worked together for so many years on the Subcommittee on Defense, as he has so ably pointed out. The gentleman from Washington is one of the most outstanding Members of this House, and he is totally dedicated to the principle of a strong national defense, totally honest, while sometimes a little abrasive, but totally honest and sincere; and I look forward to continuing our great relationship.
