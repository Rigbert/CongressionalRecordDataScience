Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House, as you know, we will not be in session tomorrow night.  Many of us remember some 6 years ago when we first had a meeting in the Capitol Police headquarters, many of us, after the traumatic morning and afternoon; and we resolved that we would show to the country a unity and a resolve that the terrorist attack would neither cow us nor deter us from the defense of freedom and liberty and our country and its people.  We are now, of course, 6 years later and continue to be involved in a battle to defeat those who by terror would intimidate us and hurt our people and our country and our way of life.  In a moment we will be led by Speaker Pelosi and Leader Boehner to the front steps of the Capitol. We will have a brief ceremony to again show to the country and, indeed, to the world that while we may have differences in debate, there are no differences in our unity of purpose to defend our country, our Constitution, and our people, and to ensure that the friends of liberty around the world will know that they have a friend in the United States of America.  So I would ask all of you to join us as Speaker Pelosi and Leader Boehner lead us out to the front steps on the House side. We will organize there, stand, and we will be led in the ``Star-Spangled Banner'' by the United States Marine Corps Band. We will have some comments by the Speaker and by the leader, and then we will conclude, as we did on that evening 6 years ago, with the singing of ``God Bless America.'' I think that was one of the most moving moments in my service in the House of Representatives. I am sure that many of you feel the same way.  So, Mr. Speaker, the House will remain in session, but we would ask all Members to join, as I said, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Boehner, and myself on the front steps of the Capitol. We will proceed now.                          ____________________
