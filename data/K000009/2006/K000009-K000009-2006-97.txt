Every single trade agreement this country has gotten itself into, whether it is NAFTA that was supposed to give us jobs, which has cost us nearly 1 million jobs now, was supposed to yield a trade surplus and it has yielded growing trade deficits. The same is true with the CAFTA countries. Now they want to push FTAA. If you look at what is happening to our country, we are losing the ability to produce the wealth that provided the middle class standard of living for a vast majority of our people, and that was America's great achievement in the 20th century. In addition to defeating Naziism and communism, it was our great achievement in the economy where we helped lift an entire society. We provided for seniors in their retirement years. We made affordable college education possible for those who had the ability and the will. And now we look at this century and we look at those possibilities being diminished for the families that used to see rising standards of living and rising tides. And it goes right back to mismanagement of the economy, the overborrowing that is going on, the lack of production, the lack of trade agreements that really open markets so that we can sell products and earn income so that we do not go into these trade deficits and end up having to monetize that through borrowing.
