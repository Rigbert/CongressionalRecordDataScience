President, there is another aspect of Judge Alito's record that is equally troubling, and that is his failure to show that he will protect the average American from the overreaching hand of government.  I question whether he is dedicated to protecting the privacy rights of individuals from government officials in many critical areas of our lives. For example, I share the concern of many of my colleagues about Judge Alito's decision to allow a police officer to conduct a strip search of an innocent 10-year-old girl.
