 President, I thank Senator Reid.  I wish to speak as cosponsor of the Graham-Feinstein amendment to remove the inventory of Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas resources from the Energy bill. I deeply believe that this proposed inventory threatens our coasts and should not be part of this Energy bill. The House already stripped the studies out of the Energy bill. The Senate should do the same.  The Energy bill's current language requires a new inventory of all the Outer Continental Shelf resources and a study of impediments to production. We oppose these studies because the purpose of the studies is really meant to undermine the moratoria which is in place. Many of these moratoria have been in place with bipartisan support on both coasts for 20 years.  Proponents of the inventory argue that it is meant to provide information and nothing more. However, the real intent is clear: The Minerals Management Service is specifically directed to inventory moratorium areas that are not available for development. Inventorying these areas does not make sense unless you want to overturn the moratoria.  The provision's second study on impediments to production makes the intent of the studies even clearer. In section 105, the popular moratorium that now protects our States' coastal resources is disparaged as ``an impediment to production.'' An impediment is something to be removed. So this is a hint as to the intention of these studies.  Perspective is important in this debate. The moratorium is there to protect our coast, not just to impede production of oil and gas. Facts are thatwe do not need the information these studies would provide to make an informed decision. We have inventoried the Outer Continental Shelf's resources before. In fact, the Minerals Management Service already publishes an update of this inventory every 5 years. We have a good idea what resources are out there, and we do not need additional studies.  Californians are also too familiar with the consequences of offshore drilling. An oilspill in 1969 off the coast of Santa Barbara killed thousands of birds, as well as dolphins, seals, and other animals. We know this could happen again, and how well I remember that cleanup effort on those beaches.  A healthy coast is also vital to California's economy and our quality of life. One of our major economic areas is the visitor industry--conventions, tourists. People do not want to see oil rigs off the coast of California, and they do not come there for that purpose. The ocean-dependent industry is estimated to contribute $17 billion to our State each year. So the economics of what the ocean produces in its pristine state are critical to our State.  In 1991, the California Department of Parks and Recreation found that almost 70 percent of Californians participated in beach activities and 25 percent of our population did some saltwater fishing. So Californians know what is at stake, and we made an informed decision: We do not want drilling off our coast.  As Mike Reilly, chairman of the California Coastal Commission, said to me in a letter:       The energy bill's provision is directly contrary to      California's strong interest in safeguarding its precious      coastal resources from offshore oil and gas-drilling related      activities, and for that reason we oppose this study.  The California Coastal Commission is the State governmental agency in charge of the coastline. I myself served on one of the regional boards of the Coastal Commission, so I know it well.  Even without the threat of future drilling, we would oppose conducting these studies in moratorium areas. We have moratoria to protect our coasts. The studies would harm resources we want to protect.  I wish to focus for a moment on the destructive studies required by this provision. The provision's original language would have allowed for exploratory drilling. I appreciate that the current version no longer allows for exploratory drilling. However, the bill still requires invasive study methods that will harm our coastal resources.  The provision specifically calls for 3-D seismic testing. One might ask, What is that? This technology requires a sparker or air gun and loud repeated pulses of underwater sound. These sounds can be heard for miles under water.  Seismic surveys harm marine mammals and have been linked to strandings of whales on beaches on multiple occasions. Seismic testing also hurts fish. Recent studies show these surveys damage the ears of at least some fish species, and that the damage may well be permanent. Fish rely on their hearing for survival. Additional seismic testing would threaten our fishery resources and our commercial fishing industries. This is a $17 billion industry in California, so we cannot afford threats to our fisheries and our fishing industry.  The inventory would also likely include something called dart core sampling. Dart cores are collected by dropping large metal tubes from ships. The tubes sink fast enough to penetrate the sea floor to a substantial depth, remove a column of rock, and then are retrieved to the ship. This is suspiciously similar to drilling. So that is what is going to go on. This is not just a benign study of people sitting at their desks on land studying something. They are sinking these tubes down to some depth, obviously to examine core samples to determine the presence of natural gas or oil.  Dart core sampling also damages organisms and habitat on the ocean floor. The dart cores also create silt plumes that smother nearby organisms.  Protecting our coastlines is not a partisan issue. The Governors of both Florida and California oppose these studies. Furthermore, the successful effort to defeat the studies in the House was a bipartisan effort. A broad coalition of Senators, including the distinguished Senators from Florida and North Carolina, opposes the studies in this provision. We should not override the wishes of the most affected States and people to protect their own coastlines.  So I ask my colleagues to vote for our amendment to strike the Outer Continental Shelf study from the Energy bill. Directly following my remarks, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the League of Conservation Voters dated June 10 be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                League of Conservation Voters,                                    Washington, DC, June 10, 2003.     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC. re: support an amendment to S. 14 to protect sensitive coastal areas                        from oil and gas drilling       Dear Senator: The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) is      the political voice of the national environmental community.      Each year, LCV publishes the National Environmental      Scorecard, which details the voting records of members of      Congress on environmental legislation. The Scorecard is      distributed to LCV members, concerned voters nationwide, and      the press.       LCV urges you to support an amendment that will be offered      by Senators Graham (FL), Feinstein, Cantwell, Wyden, Nelson      (FL), Lautenberg, Boxer, Edwards, Kerry, Murray, Lieberman,      Leahy, Snowe, Dodd and Chafee to strike section 105 of S. 14.      This provision would undermine the existing bipartisan Outer      Continental Shelf (OCS) moratorium that currently protects      some of the nation's most sensitive coastal and marine areas.       Section 105 requires the Interior Department to inventory      potential oil and gas resources of the entire Outer      Continental Shelf (OCS), including the moratorium areas,      using seismic surveys, sediment sampling, and other      exploration technologies that can damage sea life and ocean      habitat. Section 105 also requires the Secretary to report to      Congress on ``impediments'' to the development of OCS oil and      gas, including the moratoria, and the role coastal states and      localities have played in stopping environmentally harmful      offshore oil-related activities. This lays the groundwork for      an attack on the moratoria, as well as on the rights of      coastal states and local governments to raise legitimate      objections to offshore development and related onshore      industrial development that affects their coasts.       Since 1982, Congress has included language in the Interior      Appropriations bill that prevents the Department of the      Interior from conducting leasing, pre-leasing and related      activities in areas under moratoria. President George W. Bush      included the traditional legislative moratorium language in      his FY 04 budget request.       Section 105 is clearly inconsistent with more than 20 years      of bipartisan legislative and administrative actions that      protect sensitive coastal areas around the country from      offshore oil and gas activity. Please support the Graham      amendment to strike this damaging provision when the energy      bill comes to the Senate floor, and please oppose this dirty,      dangerous energy bill.       LCV's Political Advisory Committee will strongly consider      including votes on this issue in compiling LCV's 2003      Scorecard. If you need more information, please call Betsy      Loyless or Mary Minette in my office at (202) 785-8683.           Sincerely,                                                     Deb Callahan,                                                        President.
