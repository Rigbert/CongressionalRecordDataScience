President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for propounding that unanimous consent request because I think now it is clear what has happened in the Senate; that is, it will not be possible to get an up-or-down vote at any point on rolling back this outrageous boondoggle that wastes taxpayer money.  My good friend from New Mexico made the point, and I want to kind of summarize it because I think we are getting close to being able to wind down.
