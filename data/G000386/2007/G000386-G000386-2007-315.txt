 President, I would like to take a moment today to honor the distinguished civil service career of a particularly remarkable senior law enforcement official. Mr. Gary J. Lang recently retired from his position as chief of staff of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the Department of Homeland Security and in doing so, this special agent will leave behind a legacy of exceptional accomplishment and dedication to his country.  Over the years, Mr. Lang has successfully handled a series of professional challenges that truly distinguish him as one of our Nation's outstanding leaders. His entry into the Federal service in 1978 as an investigator with the Food and Drug Administration began a tradition in law enforcement to protect the public interest that exists to this day.  From his time at the FDA, through the Defense Investigative Service, and as a special agent with the U.S. Customs Service working in south Florida during an era known for its smuggling, drug trafficking and the related criminal violence, Mr. Lang demonstrated courage, honesty, and leadership in positions of increasing responsibility that have become defining characteristics of his career. He earned the respect of his colleagues and supervisors for his operational and managerial expertise in the field.  The Hill benefited from Mr. Lang's expert Federal law enforcement knowledge during the more than 4 years he spent supporting me through his work on various committees, including serving as special assistant for the Caucus on International Narcotics Control, as well as his time working with staff on the Judiciary and Finance Committees. The positive impact Gary had upon our initiatives through his expertise, dedication and memorable dignity was truly meaningful to me and our work effort.  More recently, in a headquarters management position as deputy executive director of operations/transition teams, Mr. Lang participated at the very center of the decision making that defined the investigative role the DHS would have in its mission to protect the public against acts of terror, and resulted in the creation of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the second largest investigative agency in the Federal Government. And, as a senior executive, Mr. Lang served as assistant director for ICE's Office of Investigations, managing the operational activities of a staff of 7,000 across the Nation and around the world.  Mr. Lang most recently served as the chief of staff at ICE, where he spearheaded the advancement of the Assistant Secretary's mission-critical goals across the full spectrum of the agency's operations and administrative lines of business, through its staff of 16,000. He worked diligently to ensure that ICE maximizes the application of its strategic resources to enforce U.S. trade and immigration laws and to target and neutralize national-level homeland security risks under ICE's legal authorities. Mr. Lang leads by example, by holding himself and others accountable in achieving ICE's highestpriority goals, in demanding a proactive approach in addressing emerging homeland security issues, and by setting the standard for dedication, morale and integrity throughout the ICE workforce.  Mr. Lang has distinguished himself at every level of Federal law enforcement and has engendered respect and appreciation from subordinates, peers, and leadership alike. I am glad to be able to congratulate him and honor his memorable career as it comes to a close after nearly 29 years in the Federal Government. We on the Hill wish both Gary and his wonderful wife Karyn the very best of luck for the future and thank them for their years of public service.                          ____________________
