President, I think the distinguished leader is doing all he can do in this case. I am surprised, as he said, since this bill has had huge bipartisan support and bipartisan sponsorship. It is to try to protect people from losing their retirement funds, their home, their savings for their children to go to college, from these mortgage fraud people. Everybody across the political spectrum has endorsed the bill.  We voted on every amendment to remain to the bill. There are about a dozen or more that have nothing to do with the bill. It is unfortunate for the people who are seeing their life savings being ripped off by unscrupulous criminals, and that we cannot criminalize it in such a way as to stop it. So I will be here to vote. The irony is that when the bill finally gets to a vote, it will probably pass about 90 to 5.
