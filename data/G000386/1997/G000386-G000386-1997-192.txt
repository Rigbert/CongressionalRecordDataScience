 President, In the past few months my Democratic colleagues have attempted to paint the picture of a national emergency regarding unfilled vacancies in the Federal courts. We hear talk of a judicial crisis, of justice suffering at the hands of overworked and over-burdened judges, and of the Senate Judiciary Committee creating this situation out of political motivation. A recent example is an article in the Washington Post which interviewed only one Texas district judge who described how he was plowed under with work ever since Congress decided to get tough on drug smuggling and illegal immigration. And because his district has three open seats, he can't keep up with the caseload. Unfortunately this one judge has been used in an attempt to reflect some kind of a national crisis. Maybe some clarifying remarks regarding the central issues of this article will shed some light on this matter.  As the chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, I sent a comprehensive questionnaire to article III judges last year. This extensive judicial survey addressed the very concerns raised by the May 15 article in the Washington Post. The judge in question was kind enough to respond to the questionnaire, as were most of his colleagues. As a matter of fact, 12 out of 17 active judges over 70 percent of the southern district of Texas furnished my subcommittee with detailed replies. Of those 12 judges, only 2 other judges complained of an unmanageable caseload and of a growing backlog. That means that 9 out of 12 judges found their caseloads to be manageable. As a matter of fact, one judge even stated that: ``there is absolutely no backlog whatsoever.''  Of the three judges who did complain of not being able to keep up with their workload, one had been on the bench less then 2 years, and the other two were the only two judges in the southern district involved in extensive outside work activities beyond occasionalspeaking engagements. You would think that before judges complain about needing more help, they would be devoting 100 percent of their working time and energy to their caseloads. Unfortunately, it appears that is not the case here.  One must also keep in mind the organizational set-up of the district in question. The southern district has the highest number of judges in all of Texas, one of the highest in the Nation for that matter. Right now a total of over 30 active judges, senior judges, and magistrate judges are handling cases in that district. All but three of the active judges last year found their caseloads were manageable. Therefore, when one throws statistics and numbers around, we must be careful how to interpret those figures. For example, we must factor in the number of cases which are handled by staff attorneys. Prisoner petitions, for example, are rarely handled by a judge, but are routinely included in caseload statistics. As another Texas judge has told me, once prisoner petitions are factored out, the southern district's docket has actually decreased, not increased over the last 10 years. In addition, numerous judges have contacted me and praised the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act as having had a substantial and dramatic impact on the number of prisoner filings and as having caused that number to decrease enormously. I have asked the judge in question for more information on these issues.  We must also keep in mind that many senior judges are hearing cases. In the southern district of Texas there are at least three senior judges. In order to be certified, a senior judge must carry, at a minimum, a 25 percent caseload. And many senior judges maintain a full caseload. Yet, senior judges are not factored into the weighted caseload statistics when ascertaining whether new judges are needed. In other words, senior judges are not even counted, even though they make considerable contributions. Again, beware of the numbers you read in the paper.  As a matter of fact, nationally there are 48 seniors judges certified at 25 percent workload, with another 86 senior judges who are doing at a minimum at 25 percent workload. In addition, there are 206 senior judges certified at a 50 percent or more workload. Now lets add up the numbers: if you take 25 percent of the 48 senior judges, 25 percent of the additional 85 senior judges, and 50 percent of the 206 senior judges, you would have 136 full time judges, which more than makes up for the 100 or so vacancies nationwide. Now, while I would agree that there may be pockets of districts around the country that need some help, the overwhelming majority of the judges in the district named by the Washington Post, and across the Nation for that matter, are working diligently to serve justice and are doing so with a manageable caseload and without a backlog.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the Washington Post article printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, May 15, 1997]               Cases Pile Up As Judgeships Remain Vacant                         (By Sue Ann Pressley)       Laredo, Tex.--The drug and illegal immigrant cases keep      coming. No sooner does Chief U.S. District Judge George Kazen      clear one case than a stack of new cases piles up. He takes      work home at night, on weekends.       ``It's like a tidal wave,'' Kazen said recently. ``As soon      as I finish 25 cases per month, the next 25 are on top of me      and then you've got the sentence reports you did two months      before. There is no stop, no break at all, year in and year      out, here they come.       ``We've already got more than we can say grace over down      here,'' he said.       This is what happens to a federal judge on the southern      border of the United States when Washington cracks down on      illegal immigration and drug smuggling. It is a situation      much aggravated by the fact that the Senate in Washington has      left another federal judgeship in this district vacant for      two years, one of 72 vacancies on federal district courts      around the country.       As Border Patrol officers and other federal agents swarm      this southernmost region of Texas along the Mexican border in      ever-increasing numbers, Judge Kazen's docket has grown and      grown. He has suggested, so far unsuccessfully, that a      judgeship in Houston be reassigned to the Rio Grande Valley      to help cope.       In Washington, where the laws and policies were adopted      that has made Kazen's life so difficult, the Senate has made      confirmation of federal judges a tedious process, often      fraught with partisan politics. In addition to the 72 federal      district court vacancies (the trial level), there are 25      circuit court vacancies (the appellate level) and two vacant      international trade court judgeships across the country,      leaving unfilled 99 positions, or 11 percent of the federal      judiciary. Twenty-six nominations from President Clinton are      pending, according to Jeanne Lopatto, spokeswoman for the      Senate Judiciary Committee, which considers nominations for      recommendation to the full Senate for confirmation.       Of those 99 vacancies, 24 qualify as judicial emergencies,      meaning the positions have been vacant more than 18 months,      according to David Sellers of the Administrative Office of      the U.S. Courts. Two of the emergencies exist in Texas,      including the one in Kazen's southern district.       Lopatto said the thorough investigation of each nominee is      a time-consuming process. But political observers say      Republicans, who run the Senate, are in no hurry to approve      candidates submitted by a Democratic president. The pinch      is particularly painful here in border towns. The nominee      for Brownsville, in Kazen's district, has been awaiting      approval since 1995. Here in Laredo, Kazen's criminal      docket has increased more than 20 percent over last year.       ``We have a docket,'' he said, ``that can be tripled      probably at the drop of a hat. . . . The Border Patrol      people, the Customs people at the (international) bridges      will tell you, they don't catch a tenth of who is going      through. The more checkpoints you man, the more troops you      have at the bridges, will necessarily mean more stops and      more busts.''       And many more arrests are expected, the result of an      unprecedented focus on policing the U.S.-Mexican border.      Earlier this year, Clinton unveiled a $367 million program      for the Southwest for fiscal 1998, beginning Oct. 1, that      includes hiring 500 new Border Patrol agents, 277 inspectors      for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 96 Drug      Enforcement Administration agents and 70 FBI agents.       In Kazen's territory, the number of Border Patrol agents      already has swollen dramatically, from 347 officers assigned      to the Laredo area in fiscal 1993 to 411 officers in fiscal      1996. More tellingly, in 1993, agents in the Laredo sector      arrested more than 82,000 people on cocaine, marijuana and      illegal immigration charges. By 1996, arrests had soared to      nearly 132,000, according to data supplied by the INS.       All of which is keeping Kazen and the other judges here      hopping. ``I don't know what the answer is,'' said U.S.      District Judge John Rainey, who has been acting as ``a      circuit rider'' as he tried to help Kazen out in Laredo from      his post in Victoria, Tex. ``I certainly don't see it easing      up anytime soon. There still seems to be such a demand for      drugs in this country, and that's what causes people to bring      them in. Until society changes, we won't see any changes down      here.''       In a letter to Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) in February,      Kazen outlined the need for a new judge in the Laredo or      McAllen division, rather than in Houston, where a vacancy was      recently created when then-Chief Judge Norman Black assumed      senior status. ``The `border' divisions of our court--     Brownsville, McAllen and Laredo--have long borne the burden      of one of the heaviest criminal dockets in the country, and      the processing of criminal cases involves special pressures,      including those generated by the Speedy Trial Act,'' he      wrote.       On a recent typical day, Kazen said, he sentenced six      people on drug charges and listened to an immigration case.      His cases tend to involve marijuana more often than cocaine,      he said.       ``The border is a transshipment area,'' he said. ``The fact      is, a huge amount of contraband somehow crosses the Texas-     Mexican border, people walking through where the river is      low, and there are hundreds and hundreds of miles of      unpatrolled ranchland.       ``In some cases,'' Kazen continued, ``we're seeing a      difference in the kind of defendant. We're almost never      seeing the big shots--we're seeing the soldiers. Once in a      while, we'll see a little bigger fish, but we're dealing with      very, very smart people. We see some mom-and-pop stuff, too.      There was a guy who came before me who had been in the Army      umpteen years, and he needed the money, he was going      bankrupt, so he did this 600-pound marijuana deal. He said he      stood to pick up $50,000, and now he's facing five to 40      years.       ``We see kids 18 and 19 years old,'' Kazen said. ``We see      pregnant women. We see disabled people in wheelchairs. This      is very, very tempting stuff.''       In Washington, the argument over court vacancies continues.      On April 30, Attorney General Janet Reno told the Judiciary      Committee, ``Chief judges are calling my staff to report the      prospect of canceling court sittings and suspending civil      calendars for lack of judges, and to ask when they can expect      help. This committee must act now to send this desperately      needed help.''       In remarks yesterday to the Federal Judges Association      meeting in Washington, Reno warned that ``the number (of      vacancies) is growing.''       ``As you are no doubt aware,'' Reno told the judges, ``the      level of contentiousness on the issue of filling judicial      vacancies has unfortunately increased in recent times.''                          ____________________
