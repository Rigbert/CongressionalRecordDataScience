Mr. Speaker, we've been down this road before. We've been here 31 times before voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act. We're wasting time. The American people are suffering. They have lost their jobs, their homes, and more than 50 million uninsured are worried about whether they're one illness away from disaster.  The Affordable Care Act was a historic and necessary step to cover all Americans, and all the Republicans can say is, Repeal. These are the same forces that fought against Medicare and Social Security.  People get it. If it were not for Medicare, where would our seniors be? Where would they turn?                              {time}  1640  Health care is a right, and it is not a privilege; not just for some people, but for all people. We cannot and we will not go back.  Do you want to go back? Do you want people to be afraid to have a checkup? Do you want the only doctors people see to be in an emergency room?  The Affordable Care Act is moving us away from this tragedy and toward insurance coverage for all Americans. We have come too far and suffered too long to go back. Too much progress has been made with the Affordable Care Act to go back. The American people will not be fooled this time.  Vote ``no'' on repeal, and get to work putting the American people back to work.
