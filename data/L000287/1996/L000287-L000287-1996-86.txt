Mr. Speaker, Saturday is Earth Day, a day to celebrate our environment--our Earth--our home. We must protect it; we have no other place to go.  We have a responsibility to make our world a little greener and a little cleaner--to make it safer for our children and unborn generations.  The Republican leadership does not agree.  Republicans passed the dirty water bill. Their Superfund reform lets corporate polluters off the hook. Who benefits? Polluters. Who suffers? Each and every one of us. There is more pollution in the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat.  The American people know what you are doing. They have seen the Republican assault on our environment--and they are worried. Be careful with your publicity stunts this Earth Day--the American people will not be fooled.                          ____________________
