 President, this amendment reinstates the COPS Program. I remind everyone, when the COPS Program was functioning, violent crime in America reduced 8.5 percent a year for 7 years in a row.  Mr. President, throughout the 1990s, we funded the COPS Program at roughly $1.2 billion, and it drove down crime. Now crime is rising again. In every one of our States it is up. Violent crime is up across the board. The Police Investigative Research Forum released a report which found that murders were up 10.6 percent in 2004.  The COPS Program in the crime bill worked, and the Government Accounting Office found a statistical link between the COPS grants and a reduction in crime. The Brookings Institution reported the COPS Program is one of the most cost-effective programs we have ever had in this country. Local officials urgently need this support.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators be added as cosponsors: Lieberman, Clinton, Salazar, Obama, Kohl, Harkin, Boxer, Kerry, Whitehouse, Dorgan, Dodd, Schumer, and all Democrats on this side.
