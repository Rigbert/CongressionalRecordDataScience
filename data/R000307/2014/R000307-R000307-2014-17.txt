 Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my friend from Vermont, who I know is in a hurry to leave the premises, as most Senators have already done. Perhaps he could relax and go out and have a Coke. Bad pun.  (The remarks of Mr. Roberts pertaining to the introduction of S. 2282 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')
