President, I commend the efforts of the Senator from Arkansas. He has worked very hard on this issue. What he and the Senator from Tennessee have developed clearly strengthens the bill reported by the HELP Committee. I think it is an excellent refinement, and I commend him for his efforts.  I now yield such time as he may need to the Senator from Tennessee to explain the access to specialists provisions in the amendment.
