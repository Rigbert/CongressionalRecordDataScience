Speaker, I thank the majority leader for that information. I would reiterate what the majority leader has said because I believe this is accurate. There will be no votes before Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. next week--no votes prior to 6:30 p.m. next Wednesday, so that Members are advised that they need to be available. We need to be here Wednesday at 6:30, and we need to be available every day thereafter until we get this government on a solid footing.  Is that accurate, Mr. Leader?  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. That is completely accurate. So we will have votes 6:30 Wednesday night, and we will finish our work to make sure our government continues to move forward.
