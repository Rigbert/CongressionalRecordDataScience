As the Chairman knows, one of my constituents, John Sleavin, lost his brother and nephew and niece under tragic circumstances when their pleasure boat was run down on the high seas by a Korean freighter. The accident was especially tragic because after the collision there was no attempt by the Korean freighter to rescue the family or even to notify the authorities about the collision. Mr. Chairman, you were very gracious to me in allowing my constituent to testify before the Commerce Committee on the need to reform the Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA) to provide just compensation for victims like my constituent. I believe he provided compelling testimony on the need for reforming DOHSA formaritime accidents. The FAA reauthorization bill reforms DOHSA but only for aviation accidents. I would like to ask the Chairman whether he will commit to work with me to reform DOHSA comprehensively so the reforms cover both aviation and maritime accidents.  Mr. McCAIN. Yes, I am committed to work with the Senator from Oregon and other Members who have an interest in this issue to explore this issue further and to work to reform DOHSA to appropriately provide victims of maritime accidents the same rights to recover for loss of their loved ones as are provided to victims of aviation accidents.  (At the request of Mr. McCAIN, the following statement was ordered to be printed in the Record.)                       permimeter rule exemptions
