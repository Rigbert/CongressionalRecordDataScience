President, the Senator from Texas, who has a fine legal mind and has served on the Texas Supreme Court, is exactly right.  Moreover, I wish to read what President Obama himself said about the very point the Senator from Texas made about the oath when we held up our right hand and were sworn into this body, and the oath the President took when he became President. Here is what the President said in July 2011:       I swore an oath to uphold the laws on the books . . . Now,      I know some people want me to bypass Congress and to change      the laws on my own . . . But that's not how our system works.      That's not how our democracy functions. That's not how our      Constitution is written.  President Obama had it exactly right when he stated that reality.
