 There is no question this is a constitutional amendment. There is no question the changes it seeks to achieve are constitutional. It is very thoughtful. I congratulate him for his fine statement.  I congratulate the Senator from Arizona. We are all in the business of looking at public opinion. We know the American people are interested in the energy crisis; they are interested in education; they are interested in tax relief. They are not particularly interested in campaign finance reform. I have often said it ranks with static cling as one of the great concerns among the American people. Through the sheer tenacity of the senior Senator from Arizona, we are here today beginning a debate over the next 2 weeks on a subject of very little interest to the American people. I give him credit for his tenacity and aggressiveness in pushing this item forward on the floor of the Senate early in this new administration.  I like the tone of the discussion I have heard so far. I have noticed there hasn't been any discussion about corruption. We had that discussion a year and a half ago and there has not been a single bit of proof offered. I like the restraint I sense in the Chamber today. Hopefully we will not have any unsubstantiated charges of corruption. Hopefully any Senator who makes such a charge will prove it. The absence of unsubstantiated charges of corruption, it seems to me, is also a step in the right direction in having a civil debate, and lowering our voices and pursuing this discussion in the way the President would like for us to pursue it with lower voices and in a civil manner.  The self-styled and media-pronounced reformers are captives of a Catch-22 that is titled ``campaign finance reform.'' By the way, my favorite definition of ``special interest'' is a group against what I am trying to do. I love those groups that are for what I am trying to do. That is a group of outstanding Americans trying to achieve a worthwhile purpose. To truly achieve their professed goals, reduction of special interests means foreclosing all opportunities for participation in politics. Some of our Democratic allies have actually done that. I remember 10 years or so ago when we thought the Japanese had done everything right. We were afraid they were buying up all of the American property and there was a great fear that the Japanese somehow had gotten the better of us in world competition. In Japan, they have been concerned about the influence of money and politics and they have squeezed it all the way out. In Japan,where they are unimpeded, unfettered by anything such as the First Amendment we have, the Japanese Government limits the number of days you can campaign, the number of speeches you can give, the types of places you can speak, the number of handbills and bumper stickers you can print, and the number of megaphones you can buy--one. Each candidate is entitled to one megaphone.  This was passed in order to deal with money in politics. They wanted to get it all out of politics, and they have. In the desire to get money out of politics, it was designed to improve the image of the politicians and the Parliament, so they squeezed all the money out of politics, got them down to one megaphone per candidate, and ``no confidence'' in the legislators has risen to 70 percent and voter turnout has continued to decline.  That is just one example. There are others of our democratic allies around the world who have been into this issue much further than we have gone, at least so far, and they have all had the same results: Squeeze the money out of politics, quiet all the voices, the cynicism continues to rise, the turnout continues to go down; and the reason for that of course is that cynicism and turnout are not related to this issue at all; they are related to whether or not there is a belief that the legislators are tackling the real challenges confronting the country.  The original recipe of McCain-Feingold, back in 1995 and 1997, tried to do a lot of what I have just described they have done in Japan: It had candidate spending limits; it had a ban on PACs--eliminate them; it had a bundling ban; it had a party soft money ban and an all-encompassing restriction on citizens groups who engaged in issue advocacy and independent expenditures. In other words, the entire universe of political participation--with, of course, the glaring exception of the media, where political activism is conveniently carved out of the existing campaign finance law under which we operate today, as well as on page 15 of the current McCain-Feingold bill. The media we always sort of carve out of these restrictions because the presumption, I guess, is they have a greater right to the First Amendment than any of us.  In 1997, McCain-Feingold sponsors capitulated on the crown jewel of campaign reformers, and that was spending limits on campaigns themselves. Thus, those of us who approached this issue as the Supreme Court does, from a constitutional perspective, considered that a battle won. Candidate spending limits were gone. It was the belief--certainly my belief--that members of my party would be strenuously disadvantaged by spending limits, so we were happy they were gone. But prior to that, we had been told time and time again there could be no reform without spending limits. But candidate spending limits are gone. I am glad about that, and we consider that a victory.  Since that time, those advocating reform have been in retreat in one form or another. Having first waved the white flag on these previously nonnegotiable candidate spending limits, we stand here today with a very different kind of bill and, I must say, a brighter outlook than 8 years ago at the outset of the last big floor engagement, when we had lots and lots of amendments.  Eight years ago, campaign spending limits were on the verge of enactment and would have extinguished any chance of sustained success of my party in congressional elections. We Republicans have to spend millions every election just to get a fair shake and counter the liberal bias so prevalent in the news and entertainment media.  So candidate spending limits mercifully are off the table. That means our direct campaigns are not on the hook, and we rejoice in that.  The PAC and bundling bans were jettisoned from McCain-Feingold as well, and I must say I am happy about that. I don't think there is anything wrong with people banding together in order to pool their resources and support candidates of their choice. That is as constitutional as apple pie and ought not to be restricted.  A few months later, in 1998, the citizens group restrictions were altered and a new--and, I would argue, also unconstitutional--bright line was drawn by the Snowe-Jeffords provision where an unconstitutionally vague line had been in the original McCain-Feingold. But that did not get anywhere either, inviting vehement opposition from citizens groups who would be affected, and disdained and ridiculed by constitutional experts who would litigate if it were ever enacted, such restrictions already having been struck down in Federal court over 20 times.  Let me just take a moment on this. None of us really likes the degree to which outside groups get involved in our campaigns. We don't like it. We would like to control these campaigns. But under the First Amendment, the campaign is not ours to control, and be it ever so irritating when some group who hates us comes in and starts talking about us in proximity to an election, that doesn't mean we can legislate it out of existence through our votes in this Chamber.  It irritates us, but there are a lot of things you have to endure in public life, from media criticism to outside issue groups who irritate us. But just because it irritates us doesn't mean there is any constitutional basis for eliminating it. In fact, the courts over 20 times since Buckley--over 20 times since Buckley--have struck down various efforts by State and local governments to hamper, inhibit, make it more difficult for outside groups to criticize us in proximity to an election. So the chances of that being upheld are slim to none.  In 1999, McCain-Feingold was peeled back even further, and the last vote we had on this issue provided only two features: A party soft money ban and what we would have to charitably call a bogus Beck provision which actually eviscerates current worker protections rather than codifies them as the McCain-Feingold subtitle purports.  So the last time we had a vote on this issue in the Senate, a cloture vote, was on a party soft money ban only, with a bogus Beck provision. What we have before us now is a beefed-up McCain-Feingold, again with the party soft money ban plus various efforts to restrict the voices of outside groups.  One of the issues we are going to be dealing with here in the course of the debate is the so-called nonseverability clause. It is in the President's statement of principles. Why is it there? It is there because we have an obligation not to pass laws that are clearly unconstitutional.  I hear that some of the proponents of this year's version of McCain-Feingold oppose a nonseverability clause, and I really find that mystifying. If they are so confident that the bill is constitutional, what is wrong with a nonseverability clause to guarantee that the bill either rises or falls together? They should have had a nonseverability clause back in 1974. What happened then was legislation passed that had spending limits for campaigns and contribution limits for individuals. The spending limits got struck down, the contribution limits got upheld, were not indexed, and we have today a situation in which we are left with $1,000 contribution limits set at a time when a Mustang cost $2,700 and candidates, particularly in big States, who were not fortunate enough to be wealthy, have to spend--well, there is not enough time. There is not enough time. If you are running in California and you do not have the advantage of being already well known or extraordinarily rich, 2 years is not long enough to pool together enough resources at $1,000 a contributor to be competitive.  One of the single biggest problems we have is the failure to index the hard money contribution limit back in the 1970s. Why do you think parties are relying more on soft money? Because there isn't enough hard money. Nobody capped the cost of the media at the 1974 level. I hear that we may have an amendment to deal with the question of availability of media. I think that is a good idea. I look forward to taking a look at the details of it.  We ought to be dealing with the real problem here. The real problem is not that there is too much money in politics; there is too little money in politics--particularly hard money--all of which is limited and disclosed and it is given directly to parties and candidates to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate. Yet nobody on the so-called ``reform side'' is trying to deal with the single biggest problem that we have. I hope during the course of this debate that problem will be taken care of.  The only way to get at the core of this problem, if Senators believe the influence of money and politics is so pernicious, is to change the First Amendment.  You have to go right to the core of the problem. The junior Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Fritz Hollings, will offer that amendment at some point as he has periodically over the years. He deserves a lot of credit for understanding the nub of the problem. The nub of the problem is you can't do most of these things as long as the First Amendment remains as it is.  So Senator Hollings, at some point, I think under the consent agreement, will probably at the end of the debate offer a constitutional amendment so the Federal and all 50 State governments can have the unfettered latitude to regulate, restrict, and even prohibit any expenditures ``by, in support of, or in opposition to a candidate for public office.'' It would carve and etch out of the First Amendment, for the first time since the founding of our country and the passage of the Bill of Rights, giving to the government at the Federal and State level the ability to control political speech in this country. It is worth noting that would also apply to the media.  One of the world's largest defense contractors, such as General Electric, could even be prohibited from owning America's No. 1 television station such as NBC, and a news anchor, such as Tom Brokaw, could even be prohibited from mentioning a candidate's name within 60 days of an election. This is a serious proposal. This will be offered once again on the floor of the Senate.  Barring such a wholesale repeal of constitutional freedom, a lot of what we are going to be doing in the next 2 weeks will probably fall well short of the constitutional mark. But I hope that Senators will take their responsibilities seriously and not just vote for anything, hoping the courts will at some point save us from ourselves.  A good deal of this is not in question. Virtually the exact language of the so-called Snowe-Jeffords language designed to make it more difficult for outside groups to criticize any of us in proximity to an election has been struck down within the last year and a half.  That is pretty clear evidence that this particular language is not constitutional.  As we go through these amendments, if they are clearly Federal court cases on point, I hope Members of the Senate will not ignore that. We swore to uphold the Constitution. I know sometimes it is hard to figure out what that means in the context of a given vote. But on some of these issues, it is not that unclear. There will be a decision on point.  I want to make another point about non-Federal money.  Senator Hagel was talking about his proposal to cap but not completely eliminate non-Federal money. I do not know what I think about that. But I think it is important to get the record straight about non-Federal money.  The average soft money contribution to the Republican Senatorial Committee last cycle was $520. That is less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the money that the Republican Senatorial Committee raised.  If you look at the Republican National Committee and the Republican Senatorial Committee, the largest contribution either of us got during the course of the year was $250,000. Admittedly, that is a very large contribution, but any one of those $250,000 contributions would have represented less than one-half of 1 percent of the total money raised by either the Republican Senatorial Committee or the Republican National Committee.  You can make a case, as Senator Hagel has made and will make again when he offers his substitute, that it ought to be capped. But I think you can't make a case that it ought to be eliminated. Why should the Republican National Committee or the Democratic National Committee have to finance their efforts on behalf of mayoral candidates in Omaha, NE, with Federal dollars? This is a Federal system. Under McCain-Feingold, the Republican Governors' Association would be obliterated, eliminated, gone; the Democratic Governors' Association, gone. Why? Because they don't operate with Federal money.  We have national political parties. We already have a scarcity of Federal hard dollars even to do the job for our Federal candidates. And under this proposal with that same sort of finite source of Federal hard dollars, the great national party committees would have to operate on behalf of Federal candidates and everybody else out of the same pool of resources. Regretfully, the bill does not take the money out of politics. It takes the parties out of politics. In what way is that a step in the right direction?  Yesterday, the Washington Post had a big article that included soft money contributions to the national political parties. It was pretty significant--the suggestion being that if we pass McCain-Feingold that money wouldn't be spent.  It would be spent all right. It just wouldn't be given to the parties.  Each of those interests who care about what we are doing here, who believe that it may have an impact on their business or their interest, cannot be constitutionally restricted from speaking. Maybe some court somewhere would let us completely federalize the national parties and completely eliminate their ability to operate in State and local races with Federal dollars. Maybe some court would let us do that. But no Federal court in America is going to let us quiet the voices of all these interests that have a perfect right to go out and engage in issue advocacy up to and including the day of the election. There isn't any serious person who knows anything about the First Amendment who believes that we could do that.  The proposal before us is designed to inhibit the ability of the political parties and would have no impact whatsoever on outside groups, nor should it.  They are entitled in this free society to have their say.  Mr. President, I have a series of newspaper editorials and columns from columnist George Will that I want to have printed in the Record. He has been particularly active in writing about this subject. I ask unanimous consent to have them all printed seriatim in the Record. I will add to the record in the next few days additional articles on this subject.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From Newsweek, Mar. 19, 2001]                        James Madison Remembered  madisonian doctrine today has its opposite--call it mc cainism, an                          antipluralist populism                          (By George F. Will)       There is no monument to James Madison in Washington, There      is a tall, austere monument to the tall (6'2''), austere man      for whom the city is named, a man of Roman virtues and      eloquent reticence. There is a Greek-revival memorial to      Madison's boon companion, the tall (6'2'') elegant, eloquent      Jefferson, who is to subsequent generations the most      charismatic of the Founders. But there is no monument to the      smallest (5'4") but subtlest of the Founders, without whose      mind Jefferson's Declaration and Washington's generalship      could not have resulted in this republic.       So this Friday, as an insufficiently grateful nation gives      scant notice to the 250th anniversary of Madison's birth,      pause to consider what he wrought, such as the Constitution,      and the first 10 amendments, called the Bill of Rights.      Pretty good work, that, but not more impressive than      Madison's thinking that was the Constitution's necessary      precursor. He became the Father of the Constitution only      because he was the founder of modern democratic thought.       Before Madison produced his revolution in democratic      theory, there had been a pessimistic consensus among      political philosophers: If democracy were to be possible, it      would be only in small societies akin to Pericles' Athens or      Rousseau's Geneva--``face to face'' societies sufficiently      small and homogeneous to avoid the supposed threats to      freedom--``factions.'' In turning this notion upside down--     that is what a revolution does--Madison taught the world a      new catechism of popular government:       What is the worst result of politics? Tyranny. To what form      of tyranny is democracy prey? Tyranny of the majority. How      can that be avoided? By preventing the existence of      majorities that are homogenous, and therefore stable, durable      and potentially tyrannical. How can that be prevented? By      cultivating factions, so that majorities will be unstable and      short-lived coalitions of minorities. Cultivation of factions      is a function of an ``extensive'' republic.       Which brings us to what can be called Madison's sociology      of freedom, explained in his contributions to the most      penetrating and influential newspaper columns ever penned--     the Federalist Papers, to which Alexander Hamilton and John      Jay also contributed.       In Federalist 10 Madison wrote that ``the extent'' of the      nation would help provide ``a     republican remedy for the diseases most incident to      republican government.'' He said: ``Extend the sphere, and      you take in a greater variety of parties and interests; you      make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have      a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens.''      Because ``the most common and durable source of factions'' is      ``the various and unequal distribution of property,'' the      ``first object of government'' is ``protection of different      and unequal faculties of acquiring property.''       The maelstrom of interestedness that is characteristic of      Madisonian democracy often is not a pretty spectacle.      However, Madison knew better than to judge politics by      esthetic standards. He saw reality steadily and saw it whole,      and in Federalist 51 he said people could trace ``through the      whole system of human affairs'' the ``policy of supplying by      opposite and rival interests, the defect of better motives.''       Madison's 250th birthday comes at a melancholy moment. A      banal and middle-headed populism--call it McCainism--is      fueling an assault this month on Madison's First Amendment      freedoms of speech and association. In the name of political      hygiene, advocates of ``campaign-finance reform'' are waging      war against the Madisonian pluralism of American politics.       Madisonian doctrine considers factions inevitable and      potentially healthy and useful. McCainism stigmatizes      factions as ``special interests'' whose rights to associate      and speak politically for their interests should be strictly      limited and closely regulated by government. Madison's First      Amendment says, ``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging      the freedom of speech . . . or the right of the people . . .      to petition the government for a redress of grievances.''      McCainism advocates speech rationing by the multiplication of      government-imposed limits on the right of individuals and      groups to spend money for the dissemination of political      speech.       McCainism says money ``taints'' politics. Madisonian theory      asks: What would politics consist of if it were ``untainted''      by the vigorous, unfettered participation of factions on      whose interests government impinges? McCainism aims to crimp      the activities of political parties by banning contributions      of ``soft money'' (used for party building, not for      particular candidates' campaigns or for expressly advocating      the election of defeat of specific candidates).       The Founders did not anticipate the necessity of political      parties. However, Madison quickly came to think that parties      could moderate factions by channeling and disciplining them.      Campaign-finance reformers are always unpleasantly surprised      by the unintended consequences of their reforms. Were they to      succeed in banning soft money, they would be startled by an      utterly predictable result of the hydraulics of political      money: Money banned from the parties would flow instead to      other--often wilder--factions.       Then the reformers, who cannot see a freedom without      calling it a ``loophole'' that needs closing, would try to      extend government regulation of political speech to the      speech of those factions. Madison, wise about the untidiness      of freedom, would respond by reminding the reformers of his      reform--the First Amendment.       Madison undertook the thankless task of explaining the      implications for democracy of the unflattering fact that men      are not angels, and posterity has not thanked him with the      sort of adulation bestowed upon Jefferson. However, in 1981      the Library of Congress, which began with Jefferson's      donation of his library, needed a new building and named it      after the most supple intellect among the Founders--the James      Madison Memorial Building. Perhaps that would suffice as a      monument to Madison. Or maybe his monument is our      constitutional government, which proves the possibility of      liberty under law in an extensive--a continental--republic.                                  ____                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 4, 2001]                         . . . Let Us Hope Not                          (By George F. Will)       Disquieting rumors persist that some of President Bush's      advisers are eager to sign a campaign finance ``reform''      bill, or at least to avoid vetoing one. Bush should beware of      what Edmund Burke called ``the irresistible operation of      feeble councils.''       And he should be aware of the Colorado case argued before      the Supreme Court last Wednesday. If the court affirms the      judgment of two lower courts in that case, the McCain-     Feingold bill is patently unconstitutional.       Although a plain statement of the salient fact seems      preposterous, the unvarnished truth is that McCain-Feingold's      premise is: There is something inherently corrupt about the      relationship between political parties and their candidates.      Thus the bill would ban ``soft money'' contributions to      parties--unregulated money that can be spent for party-     building, voter turnout, issue advocacy and other purposes,      but not to ``directly influence'' the election of candidates      for federal offices.       Last week, a quarter of a century after the Buckley v.      Valeo ruling, which struck down much of the 1974 campaign      finance law, the court for the first time heard arguments      about whether it is constitutional for the government to      limit a party's direct expenditures--``hard dollars''--for      its candidates. In Buckley, the court held that limits on      political money--contributions and expenditures--implicate      ``the most fundamental First Amendment activities,'' and      therefore government bears a heavy burden of demonstrating a      compelling need to limit those activities. The only such      justification the court considers sufficient is the need to      prevent corruption or the appearance thereof.       Well. In 1986 the Colorado Republic Party ran ads      criticizing a Democratic congressman who was considering      running for the Senate. It did this before the Republican      Senate candidate had been chosen. Nevertheless, the Federal      Election Commission charged that this expenditure violated      federal limits on party expenditures for candidates. Ten      years later the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against the FEC,      saying the ads were ``independent expenditures'' and thus not      subject to the ``hard dollar'' limits.       The Supreme Court remanded the case for the lower courts to      consider whether those ``hard dollar'' limits themselves are      constitutional at all. In response, the district court and      the 10th Circuit have both said they are not. Last Wednesday      the FEC asked the Supreme Court to say they are. But how can      it without saying preposterously, that there is a substantial      risk of parties corrupting their own candidates by supporting      them?       As the district court said on remand: ``The FEC seeks to      broaden the definition of corruption to the point that it      intersects with the very framework of representative      government.''       The FEC is a bureaucracy. Bureaucracies have a metabolic      urge to maximize their missions. The FEC's mission is to      regulate political discourse. A president's primary mission,      stated in his oath of office, is different--to defend the      Constitution. Bush understands the conflict between his duty      and the FEC's urge.       Around 7 a.m., Jan. 23, 2000, the day before the Iowa      caucuses, candidate Bush was in Des Moines preparing to      appear on ABC's ``This Week.'' One of those who was to      question him (this columnist), not wanting to ambush him with      unfamiliar material, and wanting from him a considered      judgment, took the unusual step of telling Bush he would be      asked if he agreed with a particular proposition from an      opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas. The proposition,      given to Bush on a 3-by-5 card, was:       ``There is no constitutionally significant distinction      between campaign contributions and expenditures. Both forms      of speech are central to the First Amendment.''       Asked if he agreed that there is something ``inherently      hostile to the First Amendment'' in limiting participation in      politics by means of contributions by individuals (Bush      favors banning ``collective speech'' by corporations, or by      unions without members' prior written consent), he briskly      replied: ``I agree.'' And asked if he thinks a president has      a duty to make an independent judgment about the      constitutionality of bills and to veto those he considers      unconstitutional, he replied: ``I do.''       This puts Bush on a collision course with much of the      political class and most of the media. It may become the      first disruption of his serene relations with them, but there      eventually must be a first, and the stake--the First      Amendment--is worth a fight.       Bush has served himself and the country well by his      congeniality efforts, but he will serve neither by continuing      them until it costs him respect. It will cost him that if he      signs McCain-Feingold.       Genius, said Bismarck, involves knowing when to stop. He      had in mind waging war, but the same is true of waging      niceness.                                  ____                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 8, 2001]                    Second Thoughts About soft Money                          (By George F. Will)       In ``Murder in the Cathedral,'' T.S. Eliot, a better poet      than moral philosopher, has a character say,       The last temptation is the greatest treason:       To do the right thing for the wrong reason.       Actually, in Washington it is good enough when people do      the right thing for any reason. So it is gratifying, if not      notably noble, that some Democrats, having recalibrated their      self-interest in the light of last year's elections, are      rethinking their enthusiasm for eviscerating the First      Amendment in the name of campaign finance reform.       Prior to the last election cycle, they favored banning      ``soft'' money--the money contributed to political parties      for uses other than for particular federal candidates, and      not used expressly to advocate the election or defeat of a      candidate. However, having done well in the 1999-2000 soft-     money sweepstakes, and lagging behind Republicans in hard      dollars--conditions to political parties that are limited but      can be spent for particular candidates--Democrats are having      second thoughts.       Those Democrats whose controlling principle is the pursuit      of short-term party advantage will have third thoughts if      convinced that their party's success at raising soft money      was contingent on control of the presidency. But some Bush      advisers may begin favoring a ban on soft money if many      Democrats become wary of a ban. Tactical considerations      always dominate when the political class writes laws limiting      communication about--and competition against--itself.       In 1897 Nebraska, Tennessee, Missouri and Florida banned      corporate contributions because, in the 1896 presidential      race, such contributions helped William McKinley defeat the      man who carried those states, William     Jennings Bryan. In 1974 Congress enacted spending limits      (declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1976) for      House races of $75,000 (about $200,000 in today's dollars),      far below what challengers must spend to threaten an      incumbent. The Senate limits, also declared unconstitutional,      would have protected incumbents. The limits started at a base      of $250,000 and varied with a state's population, and      included not just the candidate's direct spending but any      spending ``relative to a clearly identified candidate.''       Arguments for more regulation of political speech are      fueled by hyperbole about supposed ``torrents'' of money      pouring into politics. Such hyperbole probably has been heard      ever since George Washington, at age 25, first ran for the      Virginia House of Burgesses in 1757, spending 39 pounds for      160 gallons of rum and other beverages for the 391 eligible      voters--more than a quart of drink, at a cost of (in today's      currency) $2, per voter.       However, since the Voting Rights Act (1965) and the 26th      Amendment (1971) greatly expanded the electorate, spending      per eligible voter in congressional races, in today's      dollars, has hovered in a range from approximately $2.50 to      $3.50 per eligible voter, inching up slightly in the highly      competitive elections of 1994 and 1996 and reaching      approximately $4 in the competitive elections of 1998--a bit      more than the cost of one video rental.       If spending in the two-year 1999-2000 cycle for all      candidates for all offices--federal, state and local--reached      the ``obscene'' (as critics call it) total of $3 billion,      that was $15 per eligible voter, And $3 billion--$2 billion      less than Americans spend annually on Halloween snacks--is      five-one-hundredths of one percent of GDP.       So writes Bradley Smith in ``Unfree Speech: The Folly of      Campaign Finance Reform'' (Princeton University Press), which      surely will be this year's most important book on governance,      Smith, now serving on the Federal Election Commission, warns      that if reformers succeed in getting the First Amendment      thought of as a mere ``loophole'' in a comprehensive regime      of speech rationing, they will have legitimized perpetual      tinkering with the regulation of political speech for      partisan advantage after every election cycle has been      analyzed.       It is arguable whether, or how much, the First Amendment      should protect obscenity, pornography, this or that      ``expressive activity'' (e.g., topless dancing, flag      burning), ``fighting words'' or commercial speech. However,      no serious person disputes that the amendment's core concerns      is political speech. And the Supreme Court says,      incontrovertibly, that in modern society, political speech      depends on political spending.       As to whether limits on political spending abridge freedom      of political speech, consider the Supreme Court's analogy:      Would the constitutional right to travel be abridged if      government limited everyone to spending only enough for one      tank of gasoline? Or would the First Amendment right of free      exercise of religion be abridged if government limited the      right to spend money for church construction or for      proselytizing?       The First Amendment--freedom--is the right reason for      opposing ``reforms'' designed to regulate, and diminish,      political discourse. But if only tactical considerations can      cause Democrats to do the right thing, the wrong reason will      be welcome.                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 11, 2001]                     Fending Off the Speech Police                          [By George F. Will)       The coming debate on campaign fiance ``reforms'' that would      vastly expand government regulation of political      communication will measure just how much jeopardy the First      Amendment, and hence political freedom, faces. Recent      evidence is ominous.       In 1997, 38 senators voted to amend the First Amendment to      empower government to impose ``reasonable'' restrictions on      political speech. Dick Gephardt has said, ``What we have is      two important values in direct conflict: freedom of speech      and our desire for healthy campaigns in a healthy      democracy.'' Bill Bradley has proposed suppressing issue      advocacy ads of independent groups by imposing a 100 percent      tax on such ads. John McCain has said he wishes he could      constitutionally ban negative ads--ads critical of      politicians.       The basis of political-speech regulation is the 1971      Federal Election Campaign Act. Bradley Smith, a member of the      Federal Election Commission and author of ``Unfree Speech:      The Folly of Campaign Finance Reform,'' calls the act ``one      of the most radical laws ever passed in the United States.''      Because of it, for the first time Americans were required to      register with the government before spending money to      disseminate criticism of its officeholders.       Liberals eager for more regulation of political speech      should note the pedigree of their project. The act's first      enforcement action came in 1972, when some citizens organized      as the National Committee for Impeachment paid $17,850 to run      a New York Times ad criticizing President Nixon. His Justice      Department got a court to enjoin the committee from further      spending to disseminate its beliefs. Justice said the      committee had not properly registered with the government and      the committee's activities might ``affect'' the 1972      election, so it was barred from spending more than $1,000 to      communicate its opinions. After the expense of reaching a      federal appellate court, the committee defeated the FEC, but      only because the committee had not engaged in ``express      advocacy'' by explicitly urging people to vote for or against      a specific candidate.       In 1976 some citizens formed the Central Long Island Tax      Reform Immediately Committee, which spent $135 to distribute      the voting record of a congressman who displeased them. Two      years later this dissemination of truthful information      brought a suit from the Federal Election Commission's speech      police, who said the committee's speech was illegal because      the committee had not fulfilled all the registering and      reporting the campaign act requires of those who engage in      independent expenditure supporting or opposing a candidate.      The committee won in a federal appellate court, but only      because it had not engaged in ``express advocacy.''       In 1998, with impeachment approaching, Leo Smith, a      Connecticut voter, designed a Web site urging support for      Clinton and defeat of Rep. Nancy Johnson (R-Conn.) When the      campaign of Johnson's opponent contacted Smith, worried that      his site put him and their campaign in violation of the act,      he sought a commission advisory opinion.       Although Smith neither received nor expended money to      create this particular Web site, the Commission said the      law's definition of a political expenditure includes a gift      of ``something of value,'' and the commission noted that his      site was ``administered and maintained'' by his personal      computer, which cost money. And that the ``domain named Web      site'' was registered in 1996 for $100 for two years and for      $35 a year thereafter. And ``costs associated with the      creation and maintaining'' of the site are considered an      expenditure because the site uses the words that bring on the      speech police--it ``expressly advocates'' the election of one      candidate and the defeat of another.       The commission advised Smith that if his site really was      independent, he would be ``required to file reports with the      commission if the total value of your expenditures exceeds      $250 during 1998.'' If his activity were not truly      independent, his ``expenditures'' would have to be reported      as an in-kind contribution to Johnson's opponent. Smith      ignored the commission, which, perhaps too busy policing      speech elsewhere, let him get away with free speech.       Today Internet pornography is protected from regulation,      but not Internet political speech. And campaign finance      ``reformers' aspire to much, much more regulation because,      they say, there is ``too much money in politics.''       Actually, too much money that could fund political      discourse is spent on complying with the act's speech      regulations. To cover compliance costs, the Bush and Gore      campaigns combined raised more than $15 million. And Bradley      Smith notes that because of the law's ambiguities and the      commission's vast discretion, litigation has become a      campaign weapon: Candidates file charges to embarrass      opponents and force them to expend resources fending off the      speech policy. Consider this legacy of ``reforms'' during      this month's debate about adding to them.                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 18, 2001]                 Skirting What the First Amendment Says                          (By George F. Will)       With this week's beginning of Senate debate on campaign      finance reform, we will reach the most pivotal moment in the      history of American freedom since the civil rights revolution      3\1/2\ decades ago. The debate concerns John McCain's plan to      broaden government limitations on political spending in order      to intensify government supervision of political speech,      which depends on that spending.       McCain's attempt to expand government abridgement of the      First Amendment's core concern comes in the context of      rapidly multiplying rationales for vitiating First Amendment      protection of political speech. In recent years law school      journals have featured many professors' theories about why      the amendment--``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging      the freedom of speech''--should not be read as a limit on      government. Rather, they argue, the amendment empowers--     indeed, in today's world it requires--government to regulate,      limit and even ``enhance`' political speech.       Consider a symptomatic new book, ``Republic.com,'' by      University of Chicago law professor Cass Sunstein, whose      ingenuity deserves better employment. He vigorously attacks a      nonexistent problem, to which he proposes a solution that is      only, but very, useful as an illustration of the hostility      that a portion of the professoriate has toward the plain text      of the First Amendment.       The supposed problem that Sunstein wants government to      address is a maldistribution of information and opinion. He      begins with a truism, that a heterogeneous society needs the      glue of a certain level of common experiences. Then he      postulates a problem. It is that the very richness of today's      information and opinion environment--the Internet, cable,      etc.--allows people to design a personalized menu of      communications, deciding what they want to encounter and what      they want to filter out of ``a communications universe of      their own choosing.''       Sunstein says unplanned, unanticipated, even--perhaps      especially--unwanted encounters are ``central to democracy.''      They help us understand one another and prevent social      fragmentation and the extremism that ferments in closed      cohorts of the like-minded hearing only ``louder echoes of      their own voices.'' Sunstein worries especially that the      Internet, by bestowing on individuals the     power to customize what they encounter, enables people to      bypass ``general interest intermediaries'' such as newspapers      and magazines.       Not so long ago, intellectuals worried that mass media      where homogenizing American culture into uniform blandness.      Now Sunstein worries about new technologies allowing people      to ``wall themselves off'' from differences of opinion,      forming isolated enclaves.       What makes Sunstein's book pertinent to campaign finance      reformers' current assaults on the First Amendment is not the      plausibility of his diagnosis--who in cacophonous      contemporary America feels insufficiently exposed to      differences? But note the audacity of his prescription. He      would have government use various measures--from ``must      carry'' requirements for broadcasters to mandatory links      connecting Web sites to others promoting different views--to      manage ``the scarce commodity'' of the public's attention.      Government, he thinks, should actively ``promote exposure to      materials that people would not have chosen in advance.''       Now, never mind the many practical problems implicit in      Sunstein's theory, such as how government will decide which      views are insufficiently noticed, and how government will      ``trigger'' (Sunstein's word) public interest in them. But      mind this:       Sunstein is an ardent campaign finance reformer for the      same reason he recommends government management of the      information system. He thinks the First Amendment mandates      this. He does not read the amendments as a ``shall not''      stipulation that proscribes government interference with      individual rights. Rather, he reads it as a mandate for      active government management of the public's ``attention.''       To Sunstein, and to many similar academic advocates of      speech-management through campaign finance reform, what is      important about the First Amendment is not its text but the      ``values'' they say the amendment represents. They say those      values--vigorous debate; deliberative democracy; political      heterodoxy--require that the amendment's text be ignored as      an anachronism that modern life (the Internet, the costs of      campaigning in the age of broadcasting, etc.) has rendered      inimical to the amendment's values.       Politicians who, in the name of campaign finance reform,      favor increased government supervision of political      communication are not motivated by such recondite reasoning.      They simply want to tilt the system even more toward the      protection of incumbents, or of their ideological interests,      or of their ability to control their campaigns by controlling      the ability of others to intervene in the political      discourse.       However, campaign finance reformers depend on academic      theories about why it is acceptable to act as though the      First Amendment does not mean what it says.  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me just wrap it up for the time being by imagining for a moment the world envisioned by this legislation before us. That is a world where political parties are attacked by their own, beaten down, stripped of their constitutional rights, and ultimately left as shells of their former selves.  In his book ``The Party's Just Begun,'' University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato writes a section entitled ``A World Without Parties'' where he imagines a world with weak and feeble parties. The national parties today are stronger than they have ever been in my lifetime. They may have been stronger in the previous century--the 19th century--but they are now stronger than they have ever been and more useful for services provided to candidates up and down the Federal scale than ever. What would life be like without a strong two-party system? Surely even the parties' severest critics would agree that our politics would be poorer from any further weakening of the party system. We have only to look at who and what gains as parties decline in influence. The first big gainers: Special interest groups and PACs. Their money, labels, and organizational power can serve as a substitute for parties. Yet instead of fealty to national interest or a broad coalition party platform, the candidate's loyalties would be pledged to narrow special interest agendas.  Bear in mind what he is talking about here.  When a PAC contributes to a party, that money then becomes part of the broad party appeal. But a PAC, operating only on its own, has a very narrow concern. Who else gains? Wealthy candidates and celebrity candidates gain. Their financial resources or their fame can provide name identification or, for that matter, simply replace party affiliation as a voting cue. Already, at least a third of the Senate seats are filled by millionaires. And the number of inexperienced but successful candidates drawn from the entertainment and sports worlds seems to grow each year.  So again, as you reduce the influence of parties, who benefits? Special interests and PACs, wealthy candidates, celebrity candidates.  Who else gains? Why, incumbents, of course. The value of incumbency increases where party labels are absent or less important since the free exposure incumbents receive raises their name identification level. There would also be extra value for candidates endorsed by incumbents or those who ran on slates with incumbents.  Who else benefits as the parties decline in influence? The news media, particularly television news, gains. Party affiliation is one of the most powerful checks on the news media, not only because the voting cue of the party label is in itself a countervailing force but also because the perceptual screen erected by party identification filters media commentary.  Who else gains? Why, political consultants gain. The independent entrepreneurs of the new campaign technologies--such as polling, television advertising, and direct mail--secure more influence in any system when the parties decline. Already they have become, along with some large PACs, the main institutional rivals of the parties, luring candidates away from their party moorings and using the campaign technologies to supplant parties as the intermediary between candidates and volunteers.  I say to my colleagues, that is not a pretty picture. That is not a pretty picture. Remember, as I conclude my remarks here for the moment, that this bill before us at the beginning of this debate targets political parties. It purports to do a few other things, but no serious constitutional scholars believe that that can be done or, if we did, it would be upheld in court.  So make no mistake about it, this targets the political parties. Of what value is it, in our American political system, to weaken the parties, the one entity out there that will always support challengers, no matter what?  Boy, I tell you, there are some advantages to incumbency. PACs tend to like you. Individual contributors tend to like you. You get more coverage. On whom can a challenger depend? Either his own pocketbook, if he is lucky enough to have a lot of money, or the political party, the one entity there to go to bat for a challenger in American political competition.  So I welcome the debate. This is going to be an interesting debate. None of us has any real idea how it is going to end, which makes this a good deal different from the discussions we have had on this issue in recent years. We are going to have a lot of fine amendments. The first amendment will be offered by Senator Domenici of New Mexico. It will be laid down at 3:15.  I yield the floor.
