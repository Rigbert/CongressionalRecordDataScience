Chairman, the Central Oregon and Pacific operates in my Oregon congressional district. The railroad also has informed me that it would seek a $10 million loan guarantee to rehabilitate the Coos Bay Railroad Bridge, if this program were continued. The Coos Bay Railroad Bridge is the line between Coos Bay and Eugene--including all points east, north, and south--and at present, the railroad hauls over 10,000 cars per year over the bridge. During the Southern Pacific's ownership of the bridge, it threatened to abandon service over this line due to the condition of the bridge. The Central Oregon and Pacific would like to continue service to and from Coos Bay, but to do so, the Coos Bay Bridge needs major rehabilitation. The railroad has pledged $600,000 to the project, if Federal loans money is available, and the State of Oregon plans to assist in the funding.  If the railroad bridge were to fail, all of the traffic to and from Coos Bay would be diverted to the highway. This would put the existing highway bridge under enormous pressure. A lone guarantee to a private company is preferable to tens of millions of dollars in highway grants funds to rebuild highway infrastructure.
