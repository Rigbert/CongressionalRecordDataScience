 The SECTORS Act models itself after many successful industry sector partnerships in our home States of Washington and Ohio, and elsewhere, such as Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. I look forward to continuing to work with the Senator to develop innovative workforce policies and programs that help our workers and communities stay competitive in this knowledge-based, technology-advanced, global economy.                          ____________________
