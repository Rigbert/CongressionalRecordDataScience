Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a group of truly exceptional women who live in my Congressional District and whose service to our country was honored today by the passage of a bill awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to the Women Air Service Pilots of World War II.  Inspired by the attacks on Pearl Harbor, Margot DeMoss (Riverside, CA), Mary Ann Roberta Dreher (San Clemente, CA) and Jane Fohl (San Clemente, CA) answered our Nation's call to duty by joining the Women Air Service Pilots of World War II, also known as the WASP.  Created on August 5, 1943, the WASP was charged with the critical task of delivering battle-ready planes from the factory line to military bases around the world. After just 16 months, the WASP had established itself as a premier ferrying squadron. Of the more than 25,000 women that applied for training, only 1,879 were accepted to participate in the rigorous program that would eventually produce 1,074 outstanding female pilots.  The WASP founder, world famous aviator Jacqueline Cochran, challenged the status quo by asking for permission to commission WASP directly as Service Pilots, a procedure used routinely with male pilots but prohibited for women. She lobbied passionately, but eventually lost her battle both with the Comptroller General of the Army Air Force and in the halls of Congress, leading to the WASPs disbanding in 1944.  I believe that these women pioneers deserve to be acknowledged not just for their remarkable bravery and sacrifice, but for reminding us all that an uncompromising commitment to America--to its values, ideals and traditions--is a unifying force. I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 2014, Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen's bill, awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to the Women Air Service Pilots of World War II, and I am pleased that the women of WASP will finally receive the recognition they so rightfully deserve.                          ____________________
