Mr. Speaker, December 1, 1955, became a history-making day, when a brave and courageous Rosa Parks committed one simple act. By sitting down and refusing to give up her seat on a city bus, Rosa Parks ignited a non-violent revolution in America. By sitting down she inspired many of us to stand up and become participants in the modern-day Civil Rights Movement. America is a better country, and we are a better people today, just 50 years later.  The action of the brave and courageous African Americans of Montgomery, under the leadership of Martin Luther King Jr., ushered in a period of great hope and great expectation in America. During the past 50 years, we have seen unbelievable changes. We have seen the end of segregation in public transportation and in places of public accommodation. And the signs that said WHITE and COLORED have come tumbling down. In 50 years, we have witnessed the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968.  It is my hope that as we pause and take note of what happened in Montgomery 50 years ago, another generation will be inspired to take a stand. I hope another generation will be inspired to speak up and to speak out for what is fair, for what is right and for what is just in this nation and the world.                          ____________________
