 President, on behalf of the majority leader, for the information of all Senators, for tomorrow's business it is the leader's hope that the Senate will be able to begin consideration of the very important Department of Defense authorization bill. Also, the leader is hopeful that the Senate will be able to consider the intelligence authorization bill. Therefore, votes can be expected to occur during the session of the Senate on Thursday.  I would remind all Members that there is a lot of work to be done before the Senate adjourns for the July 4th recess. Therefore, the leader would appreciate all Senators' cooperation in order to complete the business of the Senate in a responsible fashion.                          ____________________
