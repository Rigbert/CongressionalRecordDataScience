 Let me ask just one more question, if I might, because I haven't heard it in this debate actually coming up. I had an experience. Over the Easter recess, I went on a missionary trip over to west Africa to Togo, Nigeria, Benin, and that area. I thought it was the appropriate thing to do, to go over and talk about Jesus on the Easter break.  The international publications I saw when I changed planes in Paris going down over the Sahara Desert and then again coming out of the Middle East, had articles--this is, what, 2 weeks ago, 3 weeks ago--articles on what a great boom our tobacco bill in this country is going to do for their tobacco industries. They were referring to both legal and illegal, I suspect. But has anybody looked at the effect that this would have on the economies of those areas where they would be direct beneficiaries of what we do here if this thing should pass?
