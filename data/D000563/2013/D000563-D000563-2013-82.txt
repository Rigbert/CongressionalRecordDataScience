President, I would like to join my colleagues and people all around the world in expressing my condolences to the people of South Africa on the passing of their great leader Nelson Mandela.  Nelson Mandela ended his extraordinary autobiography, entitled ``Long Walk to Freedom,'' with these words:       I have walked that long road to freedom. I have tried not      to falter; I have made missteps along the way. But I have      discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill, one      only finds that there are many more hills to climb. I have      taken a moment here to rest, to steal a view of the glorious      vista that surrounds me, to look back on the distance I have      come. But I can rest only for a moment, for with freedom      comes responsibilities, and I dare not linger, for my long      walk is not yet ended.  Sadly, President Nelson Mandela's long walk and his noble life are indeed now ended, but his influence on the world will endure for a long time to come. As the editorial cartoonist for the Washington Post put it, Nelson Mandela was ``larger than life--and death.''  Through enormous strength of character and a determination unlike many people in this world, Nelson Mandela helped his beloved South Africa to end the vicious system of apartheid and begin a new walk toward multiracial democracy. His dream, he often said, was that South Africa would become ``a rainbow nation at peace with itself and with the world.''  Nelson Mandela astonished the world with his capacity to forgive--even to forgive those who jailed him and persecuted his family.
