 President, I, Senator Chuck Grassley, intend to object to proceeding to H.R. 5717, the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute Enhancement Act, for the following reasons. The Smithsonian has had well documented problems keeping up with the maintenance needs of current structures and facilities. Additionally, I have investigated Smithsonian officials in the past few years regarding inappropriate use of taxpayer funds. I would like to examine whether the Smithsonian is able to meet its current operational requirements before legislation allowing for the construction of a new facility moves through the Senate without debate or even committee consideration.                          ____________________
