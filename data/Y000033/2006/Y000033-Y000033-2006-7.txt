Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, S. 2735, known as the Dam Safety Act of 2006, reauthorizes the National Dam Safety Program for 5 years, through fiscal year 2011, and makes a number of improvements to the national inventory of dams.  I want to thank Mr. Kuhl of New York for his dedication to the National Dam Safety Program. He has been a steadfast proponent of reauthorization and deserves credit for strengthening the program.  The National Dam Safety Program is administered by FEMA and was established to improve safety around dams. The program provides grants to State dam safety agencies to assist them in improving their regulatory programs, training, and research, and to create a national inventory of dams in existence.  With the passage of S. 2736 today, we clear the bill for the President and ensure authorization of this successful program through the year 2011. I support the bill and encourage my colleagues to do the same.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
