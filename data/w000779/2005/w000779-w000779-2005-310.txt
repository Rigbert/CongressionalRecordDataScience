President, I thank the distinguished Senator from North Dakota.  I come to the floor this afternoon to talk about the way this budget deals with the fastest rising costs in America, and those are our medical bills. I am going to talk about two areas--Medicaid, and the question of prescription drug coverage under Medicare.  I want to start by saying that regrettably in this budget, health care is done wrong. It is set up in a way that we are going to regret, and we are going to regret greatly. I want to take a few minutes to talk about why this budget gets it wrong on the health care issue. Health care is so important because of the demographic changes with which we are faced.  First, with respect to the Medicaid program, the way I would describe this Medicaid budget is hurt the poor now, talk about reform later. I say this recognizing that I know that is not the intent of the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire. It is certainly not the intent of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Mike Leavitt, who I know means well. But regrettably, that is what is going to happen under this Medicaid budget.
