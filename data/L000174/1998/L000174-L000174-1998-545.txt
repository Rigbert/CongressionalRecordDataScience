President, I see my friend from New Hampshire leaving the floor, and I note that he and I have shared a difficult time in the past few weeks with the ice storms in both of our States. But both New Hampshire and Vermont are coming out well. I know that Maine is now still digging out. They have gone through a terrible time, as have the people in upstate New York, and even the Province of Quebec. I note that throughout all that time, every time I called FEMA, James Lee Witt, or anybody else at the Federal level, the response was instantaneous and effective, and that I appreciate.                          ____________________
