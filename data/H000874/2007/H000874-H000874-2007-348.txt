Chairman, I would like to make Members aware now, so you have significant notice, in a full Chamber and very long in advance, that when the Committee rises, I intend to ask unanimous consent in the House that even the first vote in a series be a 5-minute vote, the first vote in a series.  I've not had an opportunity to discuss this. I wanted to give notice, and I will be discussing it with the leadership. Hopefully, they will agree. We have a lot of votes. I know Members want to get out of here today. We have the MILCON bill yet to come.  For example, on a possible motion to recommit, we're going to ask unanimous consent that that be a 5-minute vote, and there seems to be some enthusiasm for that. So, talk to all of our colleagues about not objecting to that unanimous consent.                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Carter  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The unfinished business is the demand for a recorded vote on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Carter) on which further proceedings were postponed and on which the noes prevailed by voice vote.  The Clerk will redesignate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:       Amendment offered by Mr. Carter:       Page 11, line 25, strike ``: Provided,'' and all that      follows through page 16, line 2, and insert a period.                             Recorded Vote  The Acting CHAIRMAN. A recorded vote has been demanded.  A recorded vote was ordered.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. Without objection, 2-minute voting will continue.  There was no objection.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. This will be a 2-minute vote.  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 190, noes 233, not voting 14, as follows:                             [Roll No. 476]                               AYES--190     Aderholt     Akin     Alexander     Altmire     Bachmann     Bachus     Baker     Barrett (SC)     Barrow     Bartlett (MD)     Barton (TX)     Biggert     Bilbray     Bilirakis     Bishop (UT)     Blackburn     Blunt     Boehner     Bono     Boozman     Boren     Boustany     Boyda (KS)     Brown (SC)     Brown-Waite, Ginny     Buchanan     Burgess     Burton (IN)     Buyer     Calvert     Camp (MI)     Campbell (CA)     Cannon     Cantor     Capito     Carter     Chabot     Coble     Cole (OK)     Crenshaw     Cubin     Culberson     Davis (KY)     Davis, David     Davis, Tom     Deal (GA)     Dent     Donnelly     Doolittle     Drake     Dreier     Duncan     Ellsworth     Emerson     English (PA)     Everett     Fallin     Feeney     Flake     Forbes     Fortenberry     Fossella     Foxx     Franks (AZ)     Frelinghuysen     Gallegly     Garrett (NJ)     Gerlach     Gillmor     Gingrey     Gohmert     Goode     Goodlatte     Granger     Graves     Hall (TX)     Hastert     Hastings (WA)     Hayes     Heller     Hensarling     Herger     Hobson     Hoekstra     Hulshof     Hunter     Inglis (SC)     Issa     Jindal     Johnson (IL)     Johnson, Sam     Jones (NC)     Jordan     Keller     King (IA)     King (NY)     Kingston     Kirk     Kline (MN)     Knollenberg     Kuhl (NY)     LaHood     Lamborn     Latham     LaTourette     Lewis (CA)     Lewis (KY)     Linder     Lucas     Lungren, Daniel E.
