Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a dear friend of mine, Mike Raahauge. Mike passed away on May 6, 2013 after a long battle with esophageal cancer. He was a pillar of the community in Corona and will be deeply missed.  The story of Mike's shooting range, Raahauge's Shooting Enterprises, began with his father, Linc, who had operated a pheasant hunting facility in Dixon, California in the 1950s. While on a family trip to Disneyland, Linc got lost and ended up on Highway 71. He believed the area would be ideal for pheasant farming, and in 1971 Mike helped his father move the facility to southern California after signing a lease with the Orange County Water District.  Mike's father had always wanted to move south because the region had a larger population. The family's first hunting facility, which hunted pheasants and ducks, opened on Bluff Street in Norco, California. Target traps were set on the balcony of the clubhouse and alongside a dirt road which overlooked the basin below with views of the Santa Ana River. The range was eventually moved to River Road in Corona. Throughout the years, the Raahauges offered chukar, quail and other upland game hunting. After his father's death in 1989, Mike, his wife Elaine, and their son Pat continued to operate the range as a family business.  Today, about 2,000 men, women and children annually come to Raahauge's to take the hunter safety course required to obtain a hunting license. Mike said of the program, ``Of everything I do here, that's the most important . . . It makes it a safer world. There are guns in our society. People need to know how to handle them safely. We're giving them a safe way to deal with guns.''  About 1.5 million rounds are fired by shotguns in sporting clays at the property in a year, and ten police agencies including Anaheim, Fullerton and Buena Park practice at the pistol range. It is also home to many shooting groups such as Shooting Sports Alliance, The Cowboys, LUHT Steel Challenge, Gen X and Running Gun, The Appleseed Project, SoCal Top Guns Youth Shooting, NRA Shooting Programs and Firearms Training Associates. The ranch also hosts events for local wildlife and conservation organizations such as the Cowboys, who turn the ranch into the Old West twice each year to compete with old cowboy guns. In 1982, Mike worked together with gun manufacturers to create the Hands On Shooting Sports Fair, which began that year and still occurs every first weekend in June in Corona.  Carolyn Morse, the office manager for Raahauge's, said that Mike's success came from his desire to get boys and girls and women involved in what was traditionally seen as a male-dominated sport. In fact, the most prominent girl to pick. up the sport at the range was Mike's daughter, Cindy, who competed as part of the 2000 U.S. Olympic team in Sydney. Mike said his time spent in Australia watching his daughter take fifth place in women's skeet shooting was the ``highlight of my life.'' Cindy was trained by 1984 Olympic Bronze Medalist Dan Carlisle, who lives in Houston but still makes frequent appearances at the range to give private lessons. Michael Reagan, son of President Ronald Reagan, also took shooting lessons at the range.  Mike is survived by Elaine, his wife and partner of 48 years; his son, Pat, who has three sons and two daughters; and his daughter, Cindy Shenberger, who lives in North Carolina with her husband, Kevin, and their two daughters.  Mike was a great American patriot who will always be remembered for his incredible work ethic, generosity, contributions to the community and love of family. His dedication to her family, work, and community are a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences to Mike's family and friends; although Mike may be gone, the light and goodness he brought to the world remain and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
