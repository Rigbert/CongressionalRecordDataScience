 President, I rise today to acknowledge the 30 years of service of Grays Harbor Public Utility District Commissioner Tom Casey and to congratulate him on his retirement. Commissioner Casey is the longest-serving Grays Harbor PUD Commissioner and is concluding his fifth term in office.  Commissioner Casey was elected to the Grays Harbor PUD Board of Commissioners in 1982. Prior to serving in public office, he was actively involved in energy and public utility issues from his home in Satsop, WA. Commissioner Casey also worked as a Policy Analyst in the Washington State House of Representatives.  Commissioner Casey's commitment to public power was not limited to only the Grays Harbor Public Utility District. Commissioner Casey served on the Board of Directors of Energy Northwest for 12 years, 8 of which were on the executive board. Commissioner Casey also served on the Executive Council of the Public Power Council for 16 years.  Commissioner Casey was also a key leader in the effort to create a Public Development Authority to transform the non-operational nuclear plant site in Grays Harbor County into an industrial park for economic development in a part of the state with high unemployment.  Commissioner Casey has been a fierce advocate for public power for decades. That spirit of advocacy for public power has been a keystone forCommissioner Casey for as long as I have known him. As he retires from public service, I join with others throughout the Northwest in thanking Commissioner Casey for his years of service and his steadfast belief in the unique value of public power.                          ____________________
