As the gentleman said earlier in the debate, it does not interfere in the legal proceedings, and certainly we cannot do that. But what this amendment does, and this has nothing to do with the BRAC process or Federal excess property, a museum established under this section may not be located on any property that is condemned or taken after December 31, 1999. The land that was formerly a military base BRAC process does not meet that definition. By eminent domain. That is the key here. There is a group of people who are targeted. They are targeted. Families are targeted, living on this property. They do not want to give up their homes. An elderly couple. Their son and daughter-in-law and others who live on this property and have lived there for years, they do not want to give it up. This is simple. The Coast Guard has many options on where to put this museum and many adjacent and in the city of New London. It does not have to be on property that was condemned for that purpose.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.                              {time}  1645  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mrs. Biggert).
