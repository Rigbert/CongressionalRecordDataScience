Speaker and Members, ever since the conference report was reported out, Leader Pelosi and I have told everyone how objectionable the two provisions that have been discussed are on our side of the aisle. We think they should not be in an appropriations bill. We think that they should be considered on their merits or demerits. Unfortunately, they are in the bill.  I rise in support of the bill, notwithstanding my vigorous objection to these two provisions. I rise because I, frankly, think that pursuing CRs, continuing resolutions, on a continuing basis is harmful to our economy, harmful to the growth in jobs, harmful to our national security.  I regret that the Homeland Security bill has not been included for a year as well. We undermine national security by that limitation. But, nevertheless, in a world of alternatives, I have concluded that it is better for us to pass this CR/Omnibus, as it is euphemistically referred to, than it is to defeat it.
