Speaker, I rise today to recognize a milestone in the life of a high school in Ohio. Holy Name High School in Parma Heights begins a yearlong centennial celebration in 2014.  In the first decade of the Twentieth Century, the people of Holy Name Parish determined the grade school must be expanded to offer college preparatory second level higher education. In the fall of 1914, Holy Name High School admitted its first classes. Educated by the Sisters of Charity, Holy Name was the first Catholic high school in the Cleveland area to enroll both male and female students. In its ensuing century of education, both the school and its nearly 20,000 alumni have gone on to make a difference throughout the community, nation and world.  The school's motto, ``The School's The Thing,'' was adopted in 1926. Its message conveys the credo that personal glory in school activity means little. The school encourages its students through the teachings of the Gospels to live Catholic values and develop abilities that prepare them to lead responsible, constructive, and meaningful lives. Name High School seal consists of the Chi Rho encircled by the school of identification. Its seal, the Greek Chi Rho, is an official expression of Holy Name's desire to do all things in Christ, with Him, and through Him.  Holy Name High School's rigorous academic standards are echoed in its extra-curricular activities. From clubs to performances to sports, the ``Green Wave'' excels. Coined in the 1920, the Green Wave was first used to described the perfect coordination of the Holy Name football team, which gave the appearance of a giant green wave engulfing opponents.  Through its century of education, Holy Name High School has educated its students, promoted strong values and prepared them to live lives of service. Its alumni include people in public service as well as the private sector, community leaders and those in service to our nation. As the school, its students, parents and alumni celebrate its 100th anniversary milestone, we know they will look upon their years at Holy Name High School with fond recollection, warm memories and pride. Turning toward the future, Holy Name High School walks confidently, ensuring a quality well-rounded education for the generations to come. Onward!                          ____________________
