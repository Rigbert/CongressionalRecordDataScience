Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me.  I rise in strong support of this legislation. My special interest in it is the Older Americans Indian technical fix. The bill clarifies certain provisions of the Older Americans Act to provide more flexibility to Indian tribal applicants in meeting application reporting requirements.  It allows the Assistant Secretary for Aging to take into consideration the unique cultural and geographical circumstances facing the American Indians and the Alaskan Native populations, thus allowing the tribes to tailor supportive and nutrition services to better meet the diverse needs of the American Indian and Alaskan Native communities.  Strict accountability, though, will still be retained, and standards will be retained. I think it is a great provision for this legislation, and I want to compliment the gentleman for bringing it to the floor.
