  In my State of Delaware, we celebrate a very special hero of our fire service, Norman Tate, who has been chosen as the 2002 Delaware Volunteer Fireman's Association Fireman of the Year.  The truth is, Norm Tate has earned this award--and could have received it deservedly--in any number of years. He has been a firefighter with the Seaford Volunteer Fire Department since 1959, and now holds Life Member status. He has served in, literally, every administrative office of his department, and on the ambulance squad; he has twice been named Seaford's Fireman of the Year--the only member ever, in a century-long history, to receive the award more than once, and again, he could have received it, and deserved it, just about any year.  Norm has also been the Fireman of the Year for Sussex County and for the Delmarva Volunteer Fireman's Association, and was instrumental in setting up the Delaware Volunteer Fireman's Association, DVFA, State Conference. He did the hard organizational and persuasive work of committee chairman, and has been honored with the title of President Emeritus of DVFA.  Beyond the fire service, Norm Tate has been a leader in the Seaford Lions Club, and received the Lion of the Year Award. He also received the ``Voice of the Blue Jays'' award for outstanding service to the Seaford School District, and the Distinguished Service Award from the City of Seaford.  In short, Norman Tate defines citizen-leadership. He is the extraordinary ordinary American who becomes a hero, not by ambition but in response to the needs of his community and his country. He has a deep sense of responsibility, as well as pride, arising from his citizenship; he looks for opportunities to help; he undertakes service as a privilege.  Norm Tate is being honored as Delaware's Volunteer Fireman of the Year, as his beloved Seaford Volunteer Fire Department celebrates 100 years of service to the community. There could not be--at Seaford or in any fire company a more appropriate honoree in such a meaningful anniversary year.  Norm Tate is, quite simply, the best, and as the fellow citizens he has served so well, we in Delaware are proud to honor him; as his friend, I am privileged to know him, and blessed by the influence of his generous and gracious spirit.                          ____________________
