President, this is a historic week because we will see congressional presentations of the congressional budgets, and I believe we will see stark contrasts.  Congressman Ryan of Wisconsin--nearby my home State of Illinois--is going to prepare and present to the Republicans in the House of Representatives a budget that he says will bring our overall Federal budget into balance over 10 years. It is a daunting task, and I commend him for his effort. I also have to say that we have been there before. We have heard this budget before. We know what it contains.
