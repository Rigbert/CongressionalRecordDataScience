Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 951, introduced by the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), the distinguished chair of the Education and the Workforce Committee, authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, to extend up to 6 years the time period during which construction must commence on the W. Kerr Scott Hydropower Project located on the Yadkin River in Wilkes County, North Carolina. Additionally, FERC may reinstate the construction license if it is expired.  A similar bill was passed under suspension in the last Congress, and I hope that we can pass it again today, urging the Senate to take this legislation up.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us, sponsored by the gentlewoman from North Carolina, would authorize FERC to extend for 6 years the date by which the licensee for the W. Kerr Scott Hydropower Project is required to commence construction. This is necessary because the project's licensee was not able to commence construction by the already-extended deadline of July 17, 2016.  Similar legislation authored by Ms. Foxx passed the House during the 114th Congress by a vote of 406-3. I hope my colleagues will support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.
