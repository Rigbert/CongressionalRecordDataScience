 President, as I sit here and listen to the remarks of my colleagues and I look over at that black velvet-draped desk, with the pristine white roses, and the poem by Robert Frost, and I think about the past 17 years I have been here and have looked up--and perhaps it is late at night, perhaps it is in the morning, perhaps it is in the afternoon--and Senator Kennedy is at his desk and he is talking about a bill he cares a great deal about--and, as Senator Lautenberg had said earlier, he introduced 550 bills that became law. Around here, you can introduce a bill, and maybe it goes somewhere and maybe it does not. You can introduce a bill, and maybe it is a small bill, but introducing a big bill that goes somewhere, that passes the House and is signed by the President of the United States, is not a small feat.  I listened to Senator Byrd, and in the past he has spoken about lions of the Senate. Ted Kennedy was a lion of the Senate.  During 47 years--and this morning in the Judiciary Committee, we learned he had been the longest serving member--during 47 years, if you look at the big bills: the Mental Health Systems Act of 1980, which enabled people with mental illnesses to live in their communities with minimal hospital care; the Children's Health Insurance Program, which has been spoken about, which provided health insurance to uninsured children of low-income families; the commitment to health care reform that did not diminish even as he suffered through terminal illness; his dedication to education, he was a leader in the landmark Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which established the Federal Government's commitment to fund school for poor children in public schools; No Child Left Behind, widely hailed as the greatest example of bipartisan cooperation during the Bush administration; the bill he did with Orrin Hatch, the Serve America Act, the greatest expansion of national service since the New Deal--it goes on and on and on, big bills, bills that changed people's lives, not just in a county or a city but all across this great land.  In civil rights, as you look across at that desk, he had no peers. He would stand up, and I would watch: The lower jaw would quiver slightly, and he would begin, and there would be the thunderous tones, either in the Judiciary Committee or here on the floor, that would fill the room, filled with passion, filled with conviction, filled with determination.  He played a major role in every civil rights battle in this Congress for 40 years. Who else can say that? He fought for people of color, for women, for gays and lesbians, for those seeking religious liberty. His amendments to the Voting Rights Act in 1982 led to significant increases in minority representation in elective office. He was a major sponsor of the Americans with Disabilities Act to ensure that millions of disabled Americans could live productive lives. These are not small bills; these are big bills--the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which strengthened civil rights protections against discrimination and harassment in the workplace; again, a big bill which became law.  I was part of that small group of Senators who met on immigration reform hour after hour in small hot rooms. I watched Senator Kennedy with his sleeves rolled back, when he would sit back and wait for just the right time to move or change the tenor of the discussion. True, that was one that was not successful, but it wasn't because he did not try.  Seventeen years ago, Joe Biden asked me if I would be the first woman on the Senate Judiciary Committee. I had the honor of doing it. Ted Kennedy was No. 2 in seniority sitting on that committee. I saw his commitment firsthand. It was very special. You see, I was a volunteer in the campaign for John Fitzgerald Kennedy. I was a full-time volunteer for Bobby Kennedy for his campaign. I saw the Nation ripped apart by these double assassinations. I saw Senator Kennedy, in addition to being a lion in the Senate, become a surrogate father to nieces and nephews. I saw him accept this mantle with great enthusiasm, with great love, and with a commitment that spanned the decades. That is very special. It is a very special human dimension of a great individual.  I lost my husband Bert to cancer, and I know well what the end is like. I know the good times that grow less and less and the bad times that become more and more. Ted Kennedy's life was enriched by a very special woman, and her name is Vicki Kennedy. For me, she is a mentor of what a wife should be. I have watched her sitting with him, writing speeches. I have watched her at weekend retreats. I have watched her fill his life with love, companionship, understanding.  I know a little bit about what the last months of a cancer victim are like. I can only say to her that we will do everything we can in this body to end cancer in our lifetime.  Yes, Ted Kennedy leaves very big shoes, shoes that probably will never be filled in quite the same way, from a family that will probably never be replicated.  I wish to end my remarks with a passage in the Prayer Book of the High Holy Day services for Reform Judaism. It was written when I was a teenager by a young rabbi I very much admired, and I wish to share it at this time:     Birth is a beginning and death a destination.     And life is a journey:     From childhood to eternity and youth to age;     From innocence to awareness and ignorance to knowing;     From foolishness to discretion, and then, perhaps, to wisdom;     From weakness to strength or strength to weakness     --and, often, back again;     From health to sickness and back, we pray, to health again;     From offense to forgiveness, from loneliness to love, from            joy to gratitude, from pain to compassion, and grief to            understanding--     From fear to faith; from defeat to defeat to defeat--     Until, looking backward or ahead, we see that victory lies            not in some high place along the way, but in having            made the journey, stage by stage, a sacred pilgrimage.     Birth is a beginning and death a destination.     And life is a journey, a sacred pilgrimage--     To life everlasting.  Ted Kennedy leaves a giant legacy in this body and we should not forsake it.  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from Montana is recognized.
