  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Congress,                                  Congressional Budget Office,                                   Washington, DC, April 20, 2004.     Hon. Don Nickles,     Chairman, Committee on the Budget,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you requested, CBO has prepared a      cost estimate for S. 2290, the Fairness in Asbestos Injury      Resolution Act of 2004, as introduced on April 7, 2004. The      bill would establish the Asbestos Injury Claims Resolution      Fund (Asbestos Fund) to provide compensation to individuals      whose health has been impaired by exposure to asbestos. The      fund would be financed by levying assessments on certain      firms. Based on a review of the major provisions of the bill,      CBO estimates that enacting S. 2290 would result in direct      spending of $71 billion for claims payments over the 2005-     2014 period and additional revenues of $57 billion over the      same period. Including outlays for administrative costs and      investment transactions of the Asbestos Fund, CBO estimates      that operations of the fund would increase budget deficits by      $13 billion over the 10-year period. The estimated net      budgetary impact of the legislation is shown in Table 1.       S. 2290 contains both intergovernmental and private-sector      mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act      (UMRA). CBO estimates that the aggregate direct cost of      complying with the intergovernmental mandates in S. 2290      would be small and would fall well below the annual threshold      ($60 million in 2004, adjusted annually for inflation)      established in UMRA. CBO also estimates that the aggregate      direct cost of complying with the private-sector mandates in      S. 2290 would well exceed the annual threshold established in      UMRA ($120 million in 2004 for the private sector, adjusted      annually for inflation) during each of the first five years      those mandates would be in effect.

The federal budget would record the cash value of  the noncash assets as revenues when they are liquidated by the fund's administrator to pay claims. Notes.--Numbers in the table may not add up to totals because of rounding. * = less than $50 million. CBO estimates that by 2014 the Asbestos Fund under  S. 2290 would have a cumulative debt of around $15 billion. Borrowed funds would be used during this period to pay claims and would later be repaid  from future revenue collections of the fund. We estimate that interest costs over that period would exceed $2.5 billion, and CBO's projections of the  fund's balances reflect those costs. However, they are not shown in this table as part of the budgetary impact of S. 2290 because debt service costs  incurred by the government are not included in cost estimates for individual pieces of legislation.     Major provisions       Under S. 2290, a fund administrator would manage the      collection of federal assessments on certain companies that      have made expenditures for asbestos injury litigation prior      to enactment of the legislation. Claims by private      individuals would be processed and evaluated by the fund and      awarded compensation as specified in the bill. The      administrator would be authorized to invest surplus funds and      to borrow from the Treasury or the public--under certain      conditions--to meet cash demands for compensation payments.      Finally, the bill contains provisions for ending the fund's      operations if revenues are determined to be insufficient to      meet its obligations.       S. 2290 is similar in many ways to S. 1125. A more detailed      discussion of the fund's operations and the basis for CBO's      estimates of the cost of compensation under these bills is      provided in our cost estimate for S. 1125, the Fairness in      Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2003, which was transmitted      to the Senate Judiciary Committee on October 2, 2003.     Budgetary impact after 2014       CBO estimates that S. 2290 would require defendant firms,      insurance companies, and asbestos bankruptcy trusts to pay a      maximum of about $118 billion to the Asbestos Fund over the      2005-2031 period. Such collections would be recorded on the      budget as revenues.       We estimate that, under S. 2290, the fund would face      eligible claims totaling about $140 billion over the next 50      years. That projection is based on CBO's estimate of the      number of pending and future asbestos claims by type of      disease that would be filed with the Asbestos Fund, as      presented in our cost estimate for S. 1125. While the      projected number of claims remains the same, differences      between the two bills result in higher projected claims      payments under S. 2290. The composition of those claims and a      summary of the resulting costs is displayed in Table 2.       Although CBO estimates that the Asbestos Fund would pay      more for claims over the 2005-2014 period than it would      collect in revenues, we expect that the administrator of the      fund could use the borrowing authority authorized by S. 2290      to continue operations for several years after 2014. Within      certain limits, the fund's administrator would be authorized      to borrow funds to continue to make payments to asbestos      claimants, provided that forecasted revenues are sufficient      to retire any debt incurred and pay resolved claims. based on      our estimate of the bill's likely long-term cost and the      revenues likely to be collected from defendant firms,      insurance companies, and certain asbestos bankruptcy      trust funds, we anticipate that the sunset provisions in      section 405(f) would have to be implemented by the      Asbestos Fund's administrator before all future claimants      are paid. Those provisions would allow the administrator      to continue to collect revenues but to stop accepting      claims for resolution. In that event, and under certain      other conditions, such claimants could pursue asbestos      claims in U.S. district courts.

On March      24, 2004, in a letter to Senator Hatch, CBO updated its      October 2, 2003, cost estimate for S. 1125, principally to      reflect new projections about the rate of future inflation      and an assumed later enactment date for the bill. That letter      explains that we now estimate enactment of S. 1125 at the end      of fiscal year 2004 would result in claims payments totaling      $123 billion over the lifetime of the Asbestos Fund (about 50      years).       Three factors account for the difference between the      estimated cost of claims under S. 1125 and that under S. 2290      (see Table 3):       The award values specified in S. 2290 are higher for      certain types of diseases. That difference would add about      $11 billion to the cost of claims, CBO estimates.       Under S. 2290, most asbestos claims could not be settled      privately once the bill is enacted. In contrast, under S.      1125, asbestos claims could continue to be settled by private      parties between the date of enactment and the date when the      Asbestos Fund is fully implemented; defendant firms could      credit any payments made during that period against required      future payments to the fund. Consequently, CBO estimates that      the fund created by S. 2290 would face about $5 billion in      claims that, under S. 1125, we anticipate would be settled      privately.       S. 2290 specifies that administrative expenses of the      program would be paid from the fund. Under S. 1125, in      contrast, administrative costs would be appropriated from the      general funds of the Treasury. That difference would increase      costs to the fund by about $1 billion over its lifetime.       In the limited time available to prepare this estimate, CBO      has not evaluated the differences between the two bills in      administrative procedures. Under S. 2290, the Asbestos Fund      would be operated by the Department of Labor rather than the      U.S. Court of Federal Claims. This and other differences      between the two bills could affect the cost of      administration, the timing and volume of claims reviewed, and      the rate of approval for claims payments.

Major differences in estimated revenue collections under S.          1125 and S. 2290       CBO estimates that the Asbestos Fund under S. 2290 would be      limited to revenue collections of about $118 billion over its      lifetime, including contingent collections. CBO has not      estimated the maximum amount of collections that could be      obtained under S. 1125, but they could be greater than $118      billion under certain conditions. In our cost estimate for S.      1125, we concluded that revenue collections and interest      earnings were likely to be sufficient to pay the estimated      cost of claims under that bill. That is not the case for S.      2290.       Over the first 10 years of operations, we estimate that      revenue collections under S. 1125 would exceed those under S.      2290 by $7 billion. Thus, under S. 2290 we estimate that      there would be little interest earnings on surplus funds and      that the Asbestos Fund would need to borrow against future      revenues to continue to pay claims during the first 10 years      of operations.     Estimates of the cost of resolving asbestos claims are          uncertain       Any budgetary projection over a 50-year period must be used      cautiously, and as we discussed in our analysis of S. 1125,      estimates of the long-term costs of asbestos claims likely to      be presented to a new federal fund for resolution are highly      uncertain. Available data on illnesses caused by asbestos are      of limited value. There is no existing compensation system or      fund for asbestos victims that is identical to the system      that would be established under S. 1125 or S. 2290 in terms      of application procedures and requirements, medical criteria      for award determination, and the amount of award values. The      costs would depend heavily on how the criteria would be      interpreted and implemented. In addition, the scope of the      proposed fund under this legislation would be larger than      existing (or previous) private or federal compensation      systems. In short, it is difficult to predict how the      legislation might operate over 50 years until the      administrative structure is established and its operations      can be studied.       One area in which the potential costs are particularly      uncertain is the number of applicants who will present      evidence sufficient to obtain a compensation award for      nonmalignant injuries. CBO estimates that about 15 percent of      individuals with nonmalignant medical conditions due to      asbestos exposure would qualify for awards under the medical      criteria and administrative procedures specified in the      legislation. The remaining 85 percent of such individuals      would receive payments from the fund to monitor their future      medical condition. If that projection were too high or too      low by only 5 percentage points, the lifetime cost to the      Asbestos Fund could change by $10 billion. Small changes in      other assumptions--including such routine variables as the      future inflation rate--could also have a significant      impact on long-term costs.     Intergovernmental and private-sector mandates       S. 2290 would impose an intergovernmental mandate that      would preempt state laws relating to asbestos claims and      prevent state courts from ruling on those cases. In addition,      the bill contains private-sector mandates that would:       Prohibit individuals from bringing or maintaining a civil      action alleging injury due to asbestos exposure;       Require defendant companies and certain insurance companies      to pay annual assessments to the Asbestos Fund;       Require asbestos settlement trusts to transfer their assets      to the Asbestos Fund;       Prohibit persons from manufacturing, processing, or      distributing in commerce certain products containing      asbestos; and       Prohibit certain health insurers from denying or      terminating coverage or altering any terms of coverage of a      claimant or beneficiary on account of participating in the      bill's medical monitoring program or as a result of      information discovered through such medical monitoring.       S. 2290 contains one provision that would be both an      intergovernmental and private-sector mandate as defined in      UMRA. That provision would provide the fund's administrator      with the power to subpoena testimony and evidence, which is      an enforceable duty.       CBO estimates that the aggregate direct cost of complying      with the intergovernmental mandates in S. 2290 would be small      and would fall well below the annual threshold ($60 million      in 2004, adjusted annually for inflation) established in      UMRA. CBO also estimates that the aggregate direct cost of      complying with the private sector mandates in S. 2290 would      well exceed the annual threshold established in UMRA ($120      million in 2004 for the private sector, adjusted annually for      inflation) during each of the first five years those mandates      would be in effect.
