President, today I rise to discuss H.R. 3606, the so-called JOBS Act. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance, and Investment of the Senate Banking Committee, I wish all of my colleagues to know this legislation, as it is currently drafted, is not ready to become law--and if it does, it could have unintended consequences that will hurt investors, seniors, and average American families.  One of the supposed premises behind this legislation is that if we just deregulate the securities market, then more companies will choose to issue public stock.
