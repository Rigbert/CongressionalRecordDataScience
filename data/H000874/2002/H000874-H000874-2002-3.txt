Speaker, if the gentleman will yield further, I want to join the distinguished majority leader. The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bonior) has been one of the most distinguished Members of this body. He has reflected, I think, what the American public expects of each of us: the courage to state our convictions. He stood for those convictions and fought for those convictions, irrespective of their popularity or whether he found himself to be in the majority on any given proposition.  I think every Member of this body admires the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bonior) for the courage of his convictions. We talk a lot about that, but I think few Members have displayed the courage of their convictions any more dramatically or faithfully than has our colleague, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bonior).  He is still a very young man, and he has much to offer his country. He fought for his country in Vietnam, and he came here and fought for its ideals. He will continue to serve, I know, as a productive and extraordinary American citizen. We wish him the very best in whatever he may do.
