 President, many praiseworthy things have been said about Gerald Rudolph Ford over the past 2 weeks, and this is good. It is good to see so many people speak so well of a man who was often wrongly criticized in life, and it has been uplifting to watch an entire nation stop and reflect on what it means to live a good life, good to see that old virtues still have the power to inspire.  Of course, Gerald Ford didn't seek out the Presidency, and certainly he came into the highest elected position in the land in the unlikeliest of ways.  I was recently reminded that his life didn't get off to the most promising start. Born Leslie Lynch King, Jr., in Omaha, NE, his mother and father divorced when he was 2.  His mother picked up and moved back home to Grand Rapids, where she married a paint and varnish salesman. Gerald Ford, Sr., gave Dorothy three more boys--and her first son a new name that he would carry into history.
