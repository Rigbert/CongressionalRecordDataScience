Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.  Mr. Speaker, I am afraid that my friends on the other side of the aisle aren't listening. There are two types of habeas corpus: one is the constitutional great writ. We are not talking about that here. We can't suspend that. That is in the Constitution, and we can't suspend that by law.  The other is statutory habeas corpus, which has been redefined time and time again by the Congress. That is what we are talking about here, and we have the constitutional power to redefine it.  I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).
