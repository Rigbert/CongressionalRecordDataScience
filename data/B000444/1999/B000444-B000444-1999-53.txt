 But he has gone awfully far. He says: ``I believe that proceeding to a vote under these circumstances would severely harm the national security of the United States, damage our relationship with our allies, and undermine our historic leadership,'' et cetera. ``Accordingly, I request that you postpone consideration of [this] Test Ban Treaty on the Senate floor.''  Unless there is something incredible that is likely to happen in the next 8 months, the President is not going to be--and I realize this is a legitimate worry on the part of some; that the President will wait until the middle of an election year and raise a political issue by forcing people to vote for or against this treaty--but the likelihood of changing the votes of 22 Republican Senators between now and the election is zero, I would respectfully suggest.  So what the President has done here is done the only thing I think a chief executive--Democrat or Republican--should do; that is, he did just as Jimmy Carter did when he asked for SALT II to be taken down. He did not make a commitment he would not try to have it brought up. That is not what his letter said. What he said is: Bring it down. Don't vote on it now. It is not in the national interest.  To have a President of the United States say, the treaty I, in fact, negotiated--I want to go on record as saying you should not consider it at all during the remainder of my term in office, surely damages his ability to deal internationally.  So I think he is observing the reality of the circumstance, which means that there will be no vote next year on the floor of the Senate--for if that were the case, you might as well go ahead and have the vote now.  The letter Jimmy Carter sent--and I shall read it--said:       In light of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, I      request that you delay consideration of the SALT II Treaty      on the Senate floor.       The purpose of this request is not to withdraw the Treaty      from consideration, but to defer the debate so that the      Congress and I as President can assess Soviet actions and      intentions, and devote our primary attention to the      legislative and other measures required to respond to the      crisis.       As you know, I continue to share your view that the SALT II      Treaty is in the national security interest of the United      States and the entire world, and that it should be taken up      by the Senate as soon as these more urgent issues have been      addressed.           Sincerely,                                                     Jimmy Carter.  This letter of the President of the United States--this President--goes a lot further than President Carter went in pulling down SALT II. But for the President to go beyond that, it seems to me, is to be beyond what we should be asking any executive.  The Senator from Virginia has worked mightily to try to resolve this. He has gone so far as to draft a letter which a number of Senators are likely to sign, if they have not already signed, saying: In addition to the President asking this be brought down, we the undersigned Senators ask that it be brought down. And we have no intention of bringing that treaty up next year. We do not think the treaty should be brought up in the election year.  To make the President, from an institutional standpoint, guarantee thathe is now against the treaty that he ratified, it seems to me, is to be going beyond institutional good taste.
