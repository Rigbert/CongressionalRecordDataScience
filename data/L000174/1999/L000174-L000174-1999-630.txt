President, let's go back and forth from each side, as the Senator from Utah suggested, without locking down the time. One of the reasons why we have a concern, I say to my friend from Utah, is that yesterday we were trying to rush some of these votes forward. I raised the problem with the distinguished Senator from Idaho. I said: I thought there was a whole part of the bill missing. Basically, my argument was dismissed.  Let's go on with the vote.  This afternoon, they say: Oh, by the way, this part you said was missing, yes, it was. Now we have added it back in.  I did not raise it nonchalantly. I thought it was serious. So I think that we ought to at least, if we have just gotten a hot piece of legislation still warm from the Xerox machine, get a chance to see it. It would be a lot easier to take a few minutes longer and make sure it is done correctly and we know what we are voting on than we go through as we did yesterday when the concerns that Senator Schumer and I raised were sort of dismissed, and now we find, yes, we were right, and we are back into the thing.  Let's make sure everybody understands where we are going.  I say to the Senator from Utah, maybe during the votes at 5 o'clock he and I might meet with interested parties to see if we can work times out.
