I was touched by the fact that the Senator from Illinois mentioned he is at the desk once occupied by both Senator Paul Simon and Senator Barack Obama. I had the privilege of serving with both Senators from Illinois, both great people. I know it is safe to say that Senator Obama, now President Obama, will appreciate the statement made by Senator Burris today.  Having known Senator Paul Simon, I think it safe to say he also would havebeen proud of the statement. Somewhere he is looking down and seeing this.  Last, it was my privilege as a young law student to be recruited by then-Attorney General Robert Kennedy, who made it very clear that the Justice Department was for all Americans and nobody, not even his brother, the President, would be allowed to interfere with criminal or civil rights prosecutions. I knew he meant it. I know the Senator from Illinois shares my feelings in that.  I welcome him to this body, and I thank him for his statement.  I yield to the Senator from North Dakota.
