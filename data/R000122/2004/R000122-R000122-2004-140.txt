President, I understand we are about to vote on the Feinstein amendment. On behalf of Senator Feinstein, I urge all colleagues to support this amendment. This amendment would continue a ban on assault weapons that has been in place for 10 years. It has ensured that military weapons will not be on the streets of America, will not be used in crimes, will not be accessible to terrorists, which will not force our police officers to confront these weapons.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is a continuation of present law. It is not a new law. I think the American public has come to understand this law and appreciate it and support it. I think they would urge its adoption and its continuation. Again, I urge a favorable vote on the Feinstein amendment.
