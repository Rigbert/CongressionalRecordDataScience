Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Civil Rights Oral History Project. I want to thank Congresswoman McCarthy for her leadership on this issue and for bringing this bill to the floor today.  Oral history is such an important way to capture and share our nation's story.  These are stories that need to be told, and preserved. These are the stories of the civil rights movement; eye witness accounts of the struggle for civil rights.  These are recollections of real people who marched, and even spilled a little blood in the cause of civil rights and civil liberties, and in the cause of voting rights.  These stories will be collected and preserved by the National Museum of African American History and Culture and the Library of Congress. Future generations will be able to hear the voices of people who were there during the civil rights movement, and hear them tell their stories in their own words.  We have lost too many of those voices in the last few years--Mrs. Coretta Scott King and Mrs. Rosa Parks, and we will continue to lose more courageous Civil Rights pioneers. We must begin this wonderful Oral History Project today, before we lose parts of the story. I strongly support this bill and I urge my colleagues to do the same.
