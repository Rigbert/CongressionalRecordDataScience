 President, I rise today to introduce what I consider to be one of the most important pieces of legislation that will be offered this year. It is the Language of Government Act of 1997, which designates English as the official language of the U.S. Government. I have as original cosponsors on that legislation Senators Byrd, Coverdell, Craig, Faircloth, Gregg, Helms, Hutchinson of Arkansas, Inhofe, Lugar, Santorum, Thurmond, Cochran, and Sessions.  Mr. President, language, as we all know, is a powerful factor in society. As de Tocqueville observed more than a hundred years ago, ``The tie of language is perhaps the strongest and the most durable that can unite mankind.'' That was true then, and it is true today.  Just as surely as language has the power to unite us, it has the power to divide us. One year after French-speaking Quebec rejected by a razor-thin margin the referendum to secede from Canada, our neighbor to the north is still grappling with the repercussions of the vote. English-speaking residents of Quebec have threatened to secede if Quebec proceeds with another referendum. There are many examples in the world of what happens to nations that are divided among language and ethnic lines. Bosnia, as we all know, has been decimated by ethnic strife. The countries of the former Soviet Union are in constant internal conflict and turmoil.  Today, more than 320 different languages are spoken in our country. We should respect each of these languages and those individuals who speak them. But in order to assimilate the various cultures and ethnic groups that comprise our great Nation, I believe we must use English. Furthermore, the Federal Government should not, in my opinion, be expected to administer its official business in all of these languages. Yet, the Federal Government continues to expand the number and types of services that it administers in foreign languages.  Layers of bureaucracy have been added as these governmental agencies have evolved into permanent multi-language service providers. In light of this fact, Mr. President, I believe it is imperative that we establish in America a responsible, coherent language policy for all of us.  The legislation that I offer today, on behalf of myself and the colleagues I mentioned earlier, is simple and straightforward. It designates English as the language of the Federal Government and requires that most Government functions be performed in English. There are exceptions to that rule, Mr. President, for safety, emergencies, and health-related services.  I want to emphasize that ``official English'' is directed at the Federal Government and its agents, but does not cover private citizens. In no way, Mr. President, does the bill limit an individual's use of his or her native language in home, church, community, or other private communications.  Mr. President, since last December, the Nation has engaged in a heated debate over using ``ebonics'' in public schools. We are all familiar with that. I do not intend to join that debate today. Instead, I raise this in order to mention a fundamental point. In the words of Maya Angelo, ``The very idea * * * can be very threatening, because it can encourage young men and women not to learn standard English.'' Without mastering English, our children and grandchildren cannot succeed. Indeed, as so many Americans know from their own experiences, proficiency in English propelled them from a life of poverty to a future full of opportunity.  A substantial body of evidence supports that notion and confirms that there is a direct correlation between an individual's ability to speak English in America and that person's economic fortunes.  A recent Ohio University study concluded that if immigrant knowledge of English were raised to that of native-born Americans, their income levels would increase by $63 billion annually. In 1994, the Texas Office of Immigration and Refugee Affairs published a study of Southeast Asian refugees in Texas. It conclusively demonstrated that in that population, individuals proficient in English earned over 20 times the annual income of those who could not speak English. Analysis of 1990 census data shows that immigrants' incomes rise 30 percent as a result of being able to communicate in English.  So, without question, fluency in the English language will do more to empower people coming to America than all Federal Government services combined. The Federal Government, however, is offering more services and producing more publications in a multitude of foreign languages, at a cost of $14 billion annually. Conducting official Government functions in a foreign language supposedly facilitates assimilation into our society. What began in a piecemeal fashion to facilitate assimilation has mutated into institutionalized and permanent multilingual programs and services.  The effect, Mr. President, is that it destroys the incentive to learn English, which undermines one of the key objectives of integration in this country. As I stated earlier, the plain truth is that immigrants who do not develop proficiency in English will almost always be relegated to a lower rung on the economic ladder, often far below their earnings potential.  By designating English as the official language of our Government, we send a clear and unmistakable message that English is a necessary part of life in America. But it is not just a symbolic gesture. If most communication with the Federal Government is conducted in English, it encourages fluency in English. At the same time, establishing a language policy will stop the frivolous expenditure of printing Government documents in foreign languages. There is no justification for the money wasted to produce, for example, ``The Reproductive Behavior of Young People in the City of Sao Paulo'' in Portuguese or publication on the U.S. Mint in Chinese. The money squandered on those documents would be better spent teaching English to those who cannot speak it. My bill states that the savings from this initiative be used to teach English in America.  Mr. President, national polling indicates that 86 percent of Americans support making English the official language of this country. In fact, Mr. President, 8 out of 10 first-generation immigrants in America support this legislation. As our Nation becomes more diverse, it becomes more and more important for Congress to deal with the establishment of an official language policy. Our consideration of this bill shows that we take our national heritage and democracy seriously.                                 ______                                       By
