 President, I want to make a couple final observations. Seeing the occupant of the chair, the distinguished Senator from Wyoming, I thought I would mention his imprint on this bill. Senator Enzi had an important provision requiring a report from the administration on funding by all Federal agencies on the climate change program. He required its submission by October 31, which is obviously past. The conference included the provision requiring a report by November 15. I would say, for cold State Members, this is very important so we can begin to understand how extensive these programs are and what they are costing the taxpayers.  My thanks to the distinguished Senator from Wyoming, the occupant of the Chair, Senator Enzi, for his support and contribution to this bill as well.  Finally, let me say I understand Christian, the son of our staff director, Robin Cleveland, may be watching because he is sick today. Christian, I hope you get to feeling better. We are all sorry that you were inconvenienced by your mother's long hours during the course of the last few weeks.  Mr. President, I believe we are at a point now where this bill should move forward.
