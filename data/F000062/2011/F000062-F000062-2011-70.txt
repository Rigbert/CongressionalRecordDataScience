 President, today, I honor the extraordinary life of Gilbert ``Gil'' Cates, a director, producer, mentor, and friend to not only California and New York, but the entire Nation.  Born Gilbert Lewis Katz on June 6, 1934, in New York City to Russian Jewish immigrants Nathan and Nina Katz, Gil soared to the top of the entertainment field with a focus in both film and theater.  Following his education at DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx, Gil enrolled at Syracuse University, where he majored in theater.  In 1961, Gil made his producing and directing debut on the television game show ``Camouflage.''  He accomplished countless artistic achievements during his long career as a producer and director, and in 1990 he produced the ``62nd Annual Academy Award,'' where he made his biggest mark on the industry he cherished so much.  Over the next 18 years, Gil served either as the producer or executive producer of 14 Academy Award shows. With broadcasts hosted by Billy Crystal, Whoopi Goldberg, Steve Martin, and Chris Rock, Gil is credited with restoring the telecast as the entertainment industry's most important and widely watched event.  Gil also earned a reputation as an inclusive and creative leader. As a film producer, his credits include ``Oh, God! Book II,'' ``After the Fall,'' and ``I Never Sang for My Father.'' He directed segments of ``The Twilight Zone,'' ``Hobson's Choice,'' ``The Promise,'' and ``Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams.'' As both producer and director, his body of work includes ``Collected Stories,'' ``Confessions: Two Faces of Evil,'' ``Absolute Strangers,'' ``Rings Around the World,'' and ``World's Fair Spectacular.''  Gil made his Broadway debut as the stage manager for ``Shinbone Alley'' in 1957. He made his producing debut on Broadway in 1967 with ``You Know I Can't Hear You When the Water's Running,'' and five years later made his directorial debut in 1972 with ``Voices,'' an original play with music. In total, he was involved with nine Broadway shows. The most recent, ``Time Stands Still,'' closed on January 30, 2011.  Beyond his film, television, and theater work, Gil served the entertainment industry in many leadership capacities. He was a two-term president of the Directors Guild of America, DGA, from 1983 to 1987. From 1990 to 1998, he served as founding dean of the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television, and then as a mentor and professor. He was also the founding and producing director of the renowned Geffen Playhouse in Westwood, CA. During his diverse career he served in various roles on the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.  Gil received many honors from the entertainment industry throughout his extensive career, including an Emmy Award for producing the ``63rd Annual Academy Awards'' in 1991. Gil was also Emmy-nominated for directing two television movies, ``Consenting Adult'' in 1985 and ``Do You Know the Muffin Man?'' in 1989.  As a result of his service to the DGA, he received the Directors Guild President Award, the DGA's Robert B. Aldrich Award for Service, and an Honorary Life Membership. He also received the Jimmy Dolittle Award for Outstanding Contribution to Los Angeles Theater, the Ovation Award for best play ``Collected Stories,'' and finally, a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame.  The showman who was known for his undeniable charisma and witty ways, as well as his contributions to the entertainment industry, was above all an extraordinary person who was in a class all his own.  Please join me in expressing the sympathies of this body to Gil Cates' family, including his wife, Dr. Judith Reichman; his sister, Florence Adler; his children, David, Jonathan, Gil Junior, Melissa, and Anat and Ronit Reichman; and six grandchildren.  Gilbert Cates was larger-than-life and his legacy of remarkable talent, leadership, humor, and dedication to art will no doubt live on within the entertainment industry.                          ____________________
