Speaker, it is with great respect and admiration that I stand before you today to honor Mr. John Loxas. Johnhas been recognized by the Hammond Rotary Club as an outstanding citizen who has demonstrated entrepreneurial success and vision in the community of Hammond and throughout northwest Indiana. His devotion to professional and ethical business leadership is to be commended. For his outstanding efforts, John will be presented the Robert V. Heinze Vocational Service Award by the Hammond Rotary Club on Tuesday, May 24, 2011.  The Hammond Rotary Club was established in 1920 adhering to the principles of Rotary International: ``World Peace through Understanding'' and ``Service above Self.'' These values are vigorously upheld by the Hammond Rotary Club members who passionately serve their community. Each year, the club recognizes an organization or an individual who is a praiseworthy local business or community leader by honoring the recipient with the Robert V. Heinze Vocational Service Award, and this year's recipient is John Loxas.  John Loxas was born on the island of Zakynthos, Greece. He immigrated to the United States in 1955 and settled in Hammond, Indiana. John found employment at Republic Steel in south Chicago and worked there for a few years. After being laid off from the mill, John found inspiration and opportunity at a small Hammond grocery store where he volunteered to work for no pay. During that time, he educated himself in the grocery business, and in 1958, he purchased the store that gave him his inspiration, which he ran for many years. In 1975, John's dream for a more modern grocery store came true, and he opened a second, larger location. In the years to follow, new locations would open under the name J&M Foods, and later, Reliable Supermarket. John's success and entrepreneurial spirit continued, and in 1985, he opened Olympia Lanes bowling center in Hammond, which included a high-tech scoring system, deli, lounge, and pro-shop. Olympia Lanes recently celebrated its 25th anniversary. Seeing the need for an elegant banquet hall in Hammond, John opened Dynasty Banquets in 1993. Capitalizing on his business, he opened the recently renovated Ramada Inn and Johnel's Restaurant, which are located in the same locale as Dynasty Banquets. For his remarkable business success and complete dedication to the community of Hammond, John Loxas is truly inspiring, and it is because of his efforts that he is the recipient of the 2011 Robert V. Heinze Vocational Service Award.  John's commitment to the community and his career is exceeded only by his devotion to his amazing family. John and his wonderful wife, Margaret, have five beloved children and four grandchildren.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating John Loxas on being honored with the Robert V. Heinze Vocational Service Award, and in honoring the Hammond Rotary for their outstanding contributions to the community of Hammond and all of northwest Indiana. Their constant commitment to improving the quality of life for countless individuals in northwest Indiana is truly encouraging, and they are worthy of the highest praise.                          ____________________
