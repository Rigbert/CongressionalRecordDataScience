Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1768) to amend title 28, United States Code, to allow a judge to whom a case is transferred to retain jurisdiction over certain multidistrict litigation cases for trial, and for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                                H.R. 1768       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Multidistrict Litigation      Restoration Act of 2004''.     SEC. 2. MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION.        Section 1407 of title 28, United States Code, is amended--       (1) in the third sentence of subsection (a), by inserting      ``or ordered transferred to the transferee or other district      under subsection (i)'' after ``terminated''; and       (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:       ``(i)(1) Subject to paragraph (2) and except as provided in      subsection (j), any action transferred under this section by      the panel may be transferred for trial purposes, by the judge      or judges of the transferee district to whom the action was      assigned, to the transferee or other district in the interest      of justice and for the convenience of the parties and      witnesses.       ``(2) Any action transferred for trial purposes under      paragraph (1) shall be remanded by the panel for the      determination of compensatory damages to the district court      from which it was transferred, unless the court to which the      action has been transferred for trial purposes also finds,      for the convenience of the parties and witnesses and in the      interests of justice, that the action should be retained for      the determination of compensatory damages.''.     SEC. 3. TECHNICAL AMENDMENT TO MULTIPARTY, MULTIFORM TRIAL                    JURISDICTION ACT OF 2002.       Section 1407 of title 28, United States Code, as amended by      section 2 of this Act, is further amended by adding at the      end the following:       ``(j)(1) In actions transferred under this section when      jurisdiction is or could have been based, in whole or in      part, on section 1369 of this title, the transferee district      court may, notwithstanding any other provision of this      section, retain actions so transferred for the determination      of liability and punitive damages. An action retained for the      determination of liability shall be remanded to the district      court from which the action was transferred, or to the State      court from which the action was removed, for the      determination of damages, other than punitive damages, unless      the court finds, for the convenience of parties and witnesses      and in the interest of justice, that the action should be      retained for the determination of damages.       ``(2) Any remand under paragraph (1) shall not be effective      until 60 days after the transferee court has issued an order      determining liability and has certified its intention to      remand some or all of the transferred actions for the      determination of damages. An appeal with respect to the      liability determination and the choice of law determination      of the transferee court may be taken during that 60-day      period to the court of appeals with appellate jurisdiction      over the transferee court. In the event a party files such an      appeal, the remand shall not be effective until the appeal      has been finally disposed of. Once the remand has become      effective, the liability determination and the choice of law      determination shall not be subject to further review by      appeal or otherwise.       ``(3) An appeal with respect to determination of punitive      damages by the transferee court may be taken, during the 60-     day period beginning on the date the order making the      determination is issued, to the court of appeals with      jurisdiction over the transferee court.       ``(4) Any decision under this subsection concerning remand      for the determination of damages shall not be reviewable by      appeal or otherwise.       ``(5) Nothing in this subsection shall restrict the      authority of the transferee court to transfer or dismiss an      action on the ground of inconvenient forum.''.     SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.       (a) Section 2.--The amendments made by section 2 shall      apply to any civil action pending on or brought on or after      the date of the enactment of this Act.       (b) Section 3.--The amendment made by section 3 shall be      effective as if enacted in section 11020(b) of the      Multiparty, Multiforum Trial Jurisdiction Act of 2002 (Public      Law 107-273; 116 Stat. 1826 et seq.).
