President, I yield myself 3\1/2\ minutes.  I do support the Durbin amendment. I stated earlier that I wish it would not be tabled, that we would have a straight up-or-down vote, but I think the American public understands what the vote means.  I was interested in hearing my friend, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the senior Senator from Utah, oppose the Durbin amendment last week by saying the proposed constitutional amendment does not need the flexibility of the Durbin amendment in times of economic crisis because we can build up yearly surpluses to handle tough times. The distinguished chairman said:       The balanced budget amendment in no way prevents us from      running a reasonable surplus which could be used to offset      the effects of an economic downturn. This surplus would allow      us to use fiscal policy within the balanced budget rule      better than we can now without it.  Not quite so. The constitutional amendment does not have that flexibility. It is very specific as it is written, and it prohibits this use of a rainy day fund. Indeed, those who support it--proponents' own witnesses before the Judiciary Committee over the course of the last two Congresses--pointed this out and suggested the language be amended to provide for such a rainy day fund. The distinguished Senator from Illinois was present at those hearings this year when they were saying just that.  Fred Bergsten in 1995 and James Miller in 1997, the witnesses brought by the proponents of the constitutional amendment, criticized the language before us for not including the possibility of accumulating surpluses in a rainy day fund. That is what we do to prepare for economic downturns in my own State of Vermont.  So I hope we might pay attention to the Durbin amendment. I hope we might support it.  The distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, challenged the other side to explain the language in this proposed constitutional amendment to say how it is going to work; what do the words mean; what sections do what? In fact, nobody has taken up the Byrd challenge. I urge the proponents to accept the challenge of Senator Byrd, if they can--I suspect they cannot--and say just what the words mean.  If you read the words, they say, ``Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year.'' Then they provide for waiver by a three-fifths majority --come on, that is not going to happen. The rainy day fund is out. It would require outlays, specifically, those saved in the rainy day fund, to be expended in a latter year and thereby exceed the total receipts for that fiscal year.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a letter opposing the so-called balanced budget amendment for the Coalition for Budget Integrity be printed in the Record. This is a coalition of approximately 150 organizations that oppose amending the U.S. Constitution to add a 28th amendment on budgeting. The organizations range from labor unions and children's advocacy groups, to seniors' groups, teachers, religious and secular charities, environmental groups, nutrition groups, and veterans.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               Coalition for Budget Integrity,                                 Washington, DC, February 4, 1997.                  Oppose the Balanced Budget Amendment       We, the undersigned organizations, strongly urge you to      oppose a balanced budget amendment to the United States      Constitution.       The proposed constitutional amendment is not the answer to      the nation's economic problems. The proposed balanced budget      amendment is likely to damage the economy more than      strengthen it. The amendment would require larger spending      cuts or tax increases in years of slow growth than in years      of rapid growth, precisely the opposite of what is needed to      stabilize the economy and avert recessions. The amendment      thus risks making economic recessions more frequent and      deeper.       A constitutional amendment would also be likely to limit      public investments which are critical to long-term economic      growth because the amendment fails to distinguish public      investments needed for growth from other areas of government      spending. The amendment would largely deny the federal      government a basic practice that most businesses, families,      and state and local governments use--borrowing to finance      investments with long-term payoffs.       This amendment has no place in the Constitution of the      United States. It would inappropriately draw the judicial      branch of government into the determination of fiscal and      economic policy. The amendment also undermines the important      constitutional principle of majority rule by establishing a      three-fifths vote to allow a budget to go unbalanced.       The American public has a right to know how a balanced      budget will be achieved before a balanced budget amendment is      enacted. Which important programs--education, health care,      social security, transportation, job training, environmental      protection, housing--will either be dramatically cut or      eliminated threatening America's vital interests?       We strongly urge you to oppose the constitutional balanced      budget amendment.           Sincerely,       AFSCME.       ACORN.       Advocates for Youth.       AIDS Action Council.
