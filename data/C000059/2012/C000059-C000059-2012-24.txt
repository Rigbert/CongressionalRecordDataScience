Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to California and the City of Riverside are exceptional. Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Mayor Ronald 0. Loveridge is one of these individuals. At a celebration on December 4, 2012, Mayor Loveridge will be honored as he retires after 33 years of service to the Riverside community.  Mayor Loveridge was born and raised in the Bay Area of Northern California. He received his Bachelor's degree from the University of the Pacific and his Master's degree and doctorate in political science from Stanford University. Mayor Loveridge has served in his current office since 1994, and prior to that served on the City Council for 15 years. Not only is he an outstanding public servant, he has taught courses in American Politics, Mass Media, Public Opinion, and Local Leadership in California at the University of California, Riverside since 1965. He is committed to the young people in the Riverside community, introducing them to government through internship projects and field work.  During his 16 years as Mayor, he has played a pivotal role in the political landscape of our community, region and state. He has served and chaired many boards at the community, regional, state, and national levels. The Mayor is currently a member of the Greater Riverside Chambers of Commerce, Inland Empire Scholarship Fund Board of Directors, Habitat for Humanity Riverside Board of Directors, La Sierra University Foundation Board of Directors, and Community Foundation Advisory Council. He represents the Inland region as a member of South Coast Air Quality Management District Board, the Southern California Association of Governments Regional Council, March Joint Powers Authority, the Inland Empire Economic Partnership Board of Directors, and the Southern California Goodwill Board of Directors. Statewide, the Mayor serves on the California Forward Local Government Task Force, California Mayor's Education Roundtable, the League of California Cities Board of Directors, and was a President and member of the California Air Resources Board as well as the past Chair and member of the California Assembly Fellow Program. He currently serves as the second Vice President of the National League of Cities.  The Mayor has received many honors throughout his career in public service. These include: National Association of Regional Councils, Tom Bradley Award for his outstanding leadership and commitment to improving transportation and maintaining the region's preferred quality of life; Boy Scouts of America, California Inland Empire Council, Mt. Rubidoux Division Distinguished Citizen of the Year Award; California Baptist University Spirit of Citizenship Award; American Lung Association in recognition of his efforts to improve thequality of air in the Inland Empire through passage of a clean vehicle fleet procurement policy; Robert Presley Community Service Award--Friends of California School for the Deaf, Riverside in recognition for Outstanding and Invaluable Service to the Community; Inland Congregations United for Change Award for his efforts on behalf of youth and his help in organizing a youth task force resulting in a variety of effective youth programs; Toastmasters International Communication and Leadership Award for his contributions to the Business, Professional, and Local Community; Keep Riverside Clean and Beautiful for his contribution towards accomplishing the organization's 1996-1997 goals; Neighbors United for Unwavering Commitment in Making Our Neighborhood a Safe and Pleasant Place to Live; California Preservation Foundation in recognition of Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Historic Preservation; and United Way for service and dedication to United Way of the Inland Valleys, among many others.  I have come to know Mayor Loveridge well through many years working together on a variety of public projects in Riverside, and it has been an honor to work with him on behalf of the people of Riverside, California. I can personally attest to the Mayor's incredible work-ethic, professionalism, and positive attitude. He and his wife Marsha have raised two daughters. The Mayor is an avid reader and hiking enthusiast; his favorite hike is up Mount Rubidoux.  In light of all Mayor Loveridge has done for Riverside, it is only fitting that he be honored as he retires from public service. Mayor Loveridge's tireless passion for public service has contributed immensely to the betterment of our region and the state and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he retires and moves onto the next phase of his life.                          ____________________
