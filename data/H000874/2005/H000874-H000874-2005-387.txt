Leader, I take it that in light of the fact you have not mentioned it, at this point in time it is not on the schedule. But there is a lot of discussion on this side of the aisle about that bill. Do you think it would be possible that it might be added to the calendar?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. DeLAY. I appreciate the gentleman yielding. It is possible it could be added to the calendar, but looking at how busy a week we have next week and the controversial issues that we will be bringing to the floor of the House, it is hard to say if we could put that bill on the floor next week.
