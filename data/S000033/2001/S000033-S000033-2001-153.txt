 Speaker, today I recognize the outstanding work done by participants in my Student Congressional Town Meeting held this summer. These participants were part of a group of high school students from around Vermont who testified about the concerns they have as teenagers, and about what they would like to see government do regarding these concerns.  I submit these statements to be printed in the Congressional Record, as I believe that the views of these young persons will benefit my colleagues.On Behalf of Will Babcock--Regarding Trade Skills for Young Vermonters,                               May 7, 2001       Will Babcock. Like I said, I'm Will Babcock, here      representing Youth Build. Skateland, from Williston, got      closed down recently. I'm trying to reopen it. I have plans      to talk to J.D. Real Estate to see how much the lease per      year is, and if I can get it cheaper for a youth      organization. Because, let's face it: In Burlington, there is      really nothing to do but play basketball, hang out at the      mall or hang out on the streets. So I think skating is a fun,      healthy activity. It is a good thing to do. I'm in love with      it, you know. Let's see. I have talked to everyone I can      about it. That is why I'm here today, to see if I can get any      help from Bernie or anybody with political power to get the      ball rolling, get it open again. I've organized a skate club      at school. I have got people at school doing it. All my      teachers are interested in it. And, recently, to go roller      skating, I've had to go to Lathem, New York, three hours      away. It is three hours away, four hours of roller stating,      three hours back. Because, you know, I can't really afford a      hotel room, so I have to come back the same night. I have      talked to Pat McGirk, the guy that got the skate park down      here by the waterfront started. I have been talking to him to      see if I can get something going there. I would like to try      and find some backers who think this is a good idea and want      to help me get it going. I have gone to a couple of other      meetings besides these, with churches and town halls and      stuff. So it is getting around. People are starting to hear      about it again. I'm hoping that it is more than just      ``hear,'' that people will start saying: ``Yes, I'm going to      help this kid do it. It is a good thing to do.'' Like I said,      I have support from Youth Build, Middle Friend and Family,      and everyone that roller skates, probably about a good 20, 25      of us. I need help in any way possible, so if you guys know      somebody that can get into an idea like that or anything, you      know, find out who I can ask for money, you know, for grants      and stuff. Pretty much that's it. If you have any questions      or anything.                                  ____                                      On Behalf of Richard West--Regarding Voting Reform, May 7, 2001       Richard West. There has never been an event more      politically controversial for this generation than the 2000      presidential election. As the weeks progressed after the      election, millions of voters began to question the method for      choosing the person who will become the leader of the free      world. Is it fair? Is it accurate? Does it represent the      people? In a nation where less than 50 percent of the      population participate in electing their leader, questions      such as these could alienate people who at one time      considered voting from actually going to the polls. While      many people addressed various means for fixing problems with      the electoral process, no one has come up with a method that      would allow for a smooth transition between the ballot box      and the presidency. None of the methods I will outline below      is a perfect solution, but each tries to maintain the      tradition while minimizing the chances for errors or      misrepresentation. Method 1, electoral vote splitting. For      most of its existence, the Electoral College has not posed      much controversy, but periodic elections have shown that even      a system that works the majority of the time can have some      basic flaws. Many of those problems stem from the winner-     take-all nature of the Electoral College system, where a      winner of the state gains all of the state's electoral votes,      even if he wins only by a small popular margin. The 2000      presidential election in Florida, where both Bush and Gore      received approximately half, 48.8 percent, of the electoral      vote, is a prime example of how the Electoral College      disproportionally favors the winner of a state over the      loser. Electoral vote splitting is an excellent method for      eliminating much of the sense of disproportionality. While      the system preserves the winner-take-all tradition for most      popular elections, it splits the electoral votes between the      Republican and Democratic candidates proportionally to the      percentage of the popular vote if the race is tight. Figure      1, which you have a copy of in front of you--and, hopefully,      everybody has a copy in the audience--shows generally how the      process of electoral vote splitting works. Since this method      only affects close elections, it is necessary to define what      a ``close election'' actually is. A close election is when      two primary candidates' popular vote percentages are within a      certain predetermined range. In this formula, delta is the      average of two candidates' percentages, the range is which      the blue line in figure 1 is slanted. If the candidates fall      within this range, then the number of electoral votes (E)      received by each candidate is given by the equation E=(P-     Ave)ET/2+\1/2\Et, where ``E'' is rounded, except when the      vote falls within the error margin described below. If the      candidates do not fall within this range, the number of      electoral votes received by the winner equals the total      electoral votes, and the number received by the loser equals      zero. In either case, the sum of the number of electoral      votes received by each of the candidates equals the total      electoral vote (Et) of that state. One of the advantages of      this method is that it takes into consideration the      possibility of error or controversial votes. Many examples of      controversial votes were exhibited in the 2000 Florida      presidential election. A specific controversy was the sudden      appearance of 19,000 votes that had previously been      uncounted. These votes could have been legitimate or they      could have been fraudulent. This method deals with situations      like this similarly to New York election law. New York law      states that, if there is a controversy over a certain number      of votes, a candidate's winning margin must be greater than      the number of controversial votes. Electoral vote splitting      adopts this method by stating that if both fall within the      margin epsilon, then the electoral votes are split equally,      since it is impossible to determine a clear victor.      Obviously, the electoral vote-splitting method is designed to      accommodate two main candidates. The reason behind this      decision is that, for the past 80 years, only two candidates      (a Republican and a Democrat) have had a good chance of      winning the presidency. While it is still possible to have      three candidates in contention, it is unlikely this will      occur. If this does happen, however, the electoral vote-     splitting method will not work, unless Method 2 (outlined      below) is also incorporated into voting reform. Method 2,      ``second candidate'' or transferable voting. Ralph Nader's      2000 presidential campaign has been criticized as the cause      of Gore's defeat in Florida. People believe that if Nader did      not run, then his supporters would have supported Gore      instead of them, and thus won Gore the election. Transferable      voting, used in France and other European countries, would      have given the option to voters of specifying a candidate for      their second choice. If their first-choice candidate receives      the lowest number of votes in a state election, he is      eliminated, but his votes are transferred to the second-     choice candidate specified by his supporter's ballots. The      votes are recounted, and the process continues until there      are only two remaining candidates (see figure 2, which is in      the speech). It is these candidates who would then receive      the electoral votes through the electoral vote-splitting      method. Method 3, bubble and double-blind voting. There have      been many claims that much of the controversy surrounding the      2000 presidential elections in Florida was caused by voters      not understanding the ``complicated'' punch-card ballot.      While most of these claims were made by angry Gore      supporters, there are cases where these ballots are                               ____________________
