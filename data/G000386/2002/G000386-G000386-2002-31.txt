 President, I would like to inform my colleagues that I have requested to be notified of any unanimous consent agreement before the Senate proceeds to the consideration of the nomination of Grover J. Rees to be Ambassador to the Democratic Republic of East Timor. I need further time to examine the qualifications of this nominee.                          ____________________
