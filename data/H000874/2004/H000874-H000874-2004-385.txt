Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's response. In addition, of course, to the substitute, or an amendment to the budget in the form of a substitute, I am sure that we would be, depending upon what comes out of the committee, very much committed to offering an enforcement mechanism proposal of our own. We believe that the enforcement mechanism that was in place some years ago was effective in reaching balance and, in fact, taking us into surplus. That was allowed to lapse, and is not in force now, which allowed us to do the tax cuts that were passed over the last 3 years.  Is the gentleman of the view that we will be allowed to have, under the rules, a substitute and/or amendments to the proposal for enforcement that is reported out of the Committee on the Budget?  I yield to my friend.
