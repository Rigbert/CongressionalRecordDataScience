 Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio).  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, it is true, this would take some money from fossil energy. For instance, Chevron, whose profits last year were $5.2 billion, up from $2 billion in 1999, that is a $3 billion 1-year increase, they will get $5 million or more under this bill as they did last year. The Phillips Petroleum, profits 1999 only $700 million, last year $1.9 billion. They got $7 million from this program last year.  Am I being told that Phillips Petroleum and Chevron will not make these investments themselves, and they cannot afford to make it themselves? That is not true. There are millions of Americans who cannot afford to make even more cost-effective investments themselves in weatherization. We can get three or four times as many kilowatts with weatherization for the price in today's market. We can get three or four times more with conservation programs than we can in the most efficient fossil-fired fuel plants in this country.  This amendment makes sense for individual Americans and for residential ratepayers; but it does not, I must admit my colleagues are right, it does not make sense for Westinghouse, Phillips Petroleum, GE, and other companies that just cannot afford to make these investments on their own.
