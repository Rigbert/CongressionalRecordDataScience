Speaker, last week the President sent to Congress his International Trade Agenda for 2001. Members who were expecting a detailed and responsible approach were sorely disappointed.  First, the President is trying to play the name game. He knows that Congress has repeatedly rejected Fast Track, most recently in 1998. He also knows that he does not have the support or votes in this Congress to pass this misguided approach. So instead of pushing an initiative that is bound to fail, he is trying to confuse the public and lead the press to believe that this is some kind of novel idea.  By any other name, Fast Track is Fast Track. Let us get real. Trade promotion authority, or TPA as it is being now referred to, is really nothing new. Congress rejected it before, and we will do so again. Let us remember why we rejected it in the first place.  Without congressional oversight and input, trade agreements will be negotiated by unrepresentative delegates, who were never elected, standing up for the rights of international corporations, instead of our hardworking constituents, not to mention that a thing called the Constitution of the United States grants to Congress the right toregulate commerce with foreign nations.  Our Founding Fathers granted Congress this responsibility as a check on the executive branch. It is critical that we do not trade away the right to represent our constituents.  They have sent us here to represent their wishes, not those of only international corporations looking to their bottom line. The second round of the name game came when President Bush referred to labor and environment as core standards.  If these are core standards, why are they not being included in the core text of trade agreements? That would make sense, would it not? Instead, the President wants labor rights, get ready for this, to be enforced by the U.S. Agency for International Development and environmental standards by the World Health Organization. Who is he kidding? Not Congress.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to do exactly what they have done numerous times before. Reject this name game. Reject Fast Track. Stand up for the American people, their standard of living, their right to work for a living wage, their right to live in an environment which is not polluting, and to use the power of this marketplace to raise living standards in other parts of the world, not pull us down to their standards. Reject Fast Track. Reject the name game. Reject trade promotion authority.                          ____________________
