Mr. Speaker, this so-called economic stimulus package is a sham. It is a shame. It is a disgrace. It is a stimulus charade.  A couple of weeks ago, the Washington Post published a great editorial about this bill. It said, ``It's the wrong thing to do, a hijacking of the current crisis, economic and otherwise, on behalf of an agenda that long preceded the crisis and has little to do with easing it. These are tax cuts far more likely to stimulate increased campaign contributions than increased economic activity.''                              {time}  1400  The Washington Post got it right. This so-called economic stimulus package does very little, if anything, to stimulate the economy; and it will hurt us in the long run.  This bill, this proposal, does not help a woman, a mother, who lost her husband one week at the World Trade Center, and the next week she lost her job. This proposal is not fair, it is not right, it is not just. It fails to meet the basic human needs of our citizens who are hurting. This bill is business as usual, politics as usual. We have seen these tax cuts before.  Since September 11, the American people have been concerned about their safety and the security of their families. That is what we should be focused on, not passing tax cuts for big corporations. It is the same tired old list of tax cuts. They have nothing to do with stimulating the economy or helping us to recover from September 11.  This is not the time for irresponsible tax cuts that we cannot afford. We should be considering a comprehensive economic stimulus package that addresses the problem. It must help people who have lost their jobs and health care. It must help low-income Americans who are struggling very hard to make ends meet. We should be considering reasonable temporary breaks for businesses that will encourage them to spend money right here and now. We should be investing in infrastructure projects that create jobs and help us prepare for the future. But any package, any proposal, must be paid for over time so we can get our economy back on track.  Mr. Speaker, this bill is not the answer. It is a Republican bill. It is partisan. It is a charade. We need to be working together to pass legislation that truly helps the American people and gets this country back on its feet.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to have the courage, raw courage, to stand up, be counted and vote against this bill.
