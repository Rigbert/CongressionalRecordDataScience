I agree with the gentleman. It was not a conference meeting, however. It may have been a meeting with the President.  We hope that we will proceed.  The FAA conference report, we were told that that was going to be on the floor last week and this week. We understood that we would consider it this week. The rule was not brought up. Can the gentleman illuminate for the Members where that bill stands? I know the previous week we could not find the papers, as I recall. This week we understand the papers have been found, but we did not move ahead on that. Can the Majority Leader tell us why we have not proceeded on that and what he perceives to be the future of the FAA reauthorization bill?  Mr. DeLAY. I appreciate the gentleman yielding.  As the gentleman knows, and people should take notice, that FAA activities are currently operating under the short-term continuing resolution that we passed last week. In the meantime, Chairman Young and Chairman Mica are working with their Senate counterparts and the committee members on their conference committees to reach the necessary accommodations so that we can have the reauthorization signed into law before this current C.R. expires. So, work is ongoing. As soon as the agreements are made between the House and the Senate, I think we can proceed.
