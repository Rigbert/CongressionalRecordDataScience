 President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi for his kind remarks.  Reflecting upon the 98-to-1 vote, I can just simply say the feeling of this body has dramatically changed toward this legislation, because I remember the first time I introduced an amendment on this and got it through on a voice vote. There were just a few Members here at that particular time. One Member was so mad at me after I got it passed that the individual said to me, ``Grassley, I hope you are the first one sued.''  Well, we have to keep diligent to get things done. And I think that one of the things that I have learned to do is to stick to your guns.  Basically, Prime Minister Disraeli, in the second half of the last century, had this to say as a way to determine success. ``Constancy of purpose is the secret of success,'' is what Disraeli said. I think that that is a very good rule for anybody who wants to get anything done in the congressional system that we have in this country. If you stick to it and if you are on the right track, you will eventually accomplish your goal. I think that even Senator Glenn has a longer view toward that end than I do, because, as I stated before, he was involved in this before I ever got involved in it.  I yield the floor.
