President, today, I am introducing legislation to ensure that the Nation's highest court can serve its function as the court of lastresort in our judicial system. The Supreme Court's effectiveness is compromised when it does not have a full slate of nine justices sitting in a given case. When a Justice needs to recuse from a matter under the rules that govern judicial conflicts of interest, the Supreme Court may be rendered ineffective, because there are no provisions in place to allow another to be designated to sit in his or her place. Given the Court's recent rash of 5:4 rulings, the absence of one Justice could result in a 4:4 decision. In that scenario, the Supreme Court cannot serve its function and the lower court decision stands. This was a very real concern for Chief Justice William Rehnquist. He explained that such a stalemate on the Court where there were conflicting rulings in the lower courts, ``would lay down `one rule in Athens, and another rule in Rome' with a vengeance.''  Under the existing statute, retired Justices may be designated to sit on any court in the land except the one to which they were confirmed. The bill I am introducing today will ensure that the Supreme Court can continue to serve its essential function. I hope that it will encourage Justices to recuse themselves when they have a financial conflict of interest or their participation would create the appearance of impropriety. In recent history, Justices have refused to recuse themselves and one of their justifications has been that the Supreme Court is unlike lower courts because no other judge can serve in their place when Justices recuse.  When I met with Justice John Paul Stevens earlier in the year before he announced his retirement, he suggested exploring legislation that would allow retired U.S. Supreme Court Justices to sit by designation on all of our federal courts. Currently, Justices Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor and David Souter may sit by designation on any Federal court except the U.S. Supreme Court, the Court to which they were confirmed. This defies common sense.  Recent news about conflicts of interest has raised serious questions in the minds of Americans about the impartiality of the judiciary. These serious concerns only serve to undermine the public trust in our Nation's courts. Allowing retired Justices to sit on the Supreme Court would encourage sitting justices to recuse themselves when there is even an appearance of a conflict of interest regarding a case before the Court. Such a designation would also help to avoid the potential of 4:4 splits which concerned Chief Justice Rehnquist. I am confident the American people want the Supreme Court to serve as the final word in our federal judicial system. I encourage my fellow Senators to consider the legislation I am introducing today as a common-sense solution to preserve the role that the Supreme Court plays in our democracy.  Mr. President, I ask by unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objetion, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3871       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION AND ASSIGNMENT OF RETIRED SUPREME                    COURT JUSTICES.       Section 294 of title 28, United States Code, is amended--       (1) in subsection (a), by inserting ``(1)'' after ``(a)'';       (2) by adding at the end the following:       ``(2) Any retired Chief Justice of the United States or any      retired Associate Justice of the Supreme Court may be      designated and assigned to serve as a justice on the Supreme      Court of the United States in a particular case if--       ``(A) any active justice is recused from that case; and       ``(B) a majority of active justices vote to designate and      assign that retired Chief Justice or Associate Justice.'';      and       (3) in subsection (d), by striking ``No such designation or      assignment shall be made to the Supreme Court.'' and      inserting ``Except as provided under subsection (a)(2), no      designation or assignment under this section shall be made to      the Supreme Court.''.                                 ______                                       By
