Speaker, I was driving in this morning listening to the radio and I heard an ad. The ad said, vote for the bipartisan energy bill when it comes up today, and it told you to call your local Congressperson. Who are you going to call? Not even Ghost Busters can find a Republican to make this a bipartisan bill.  Our energy needs in this country are going to grow by about 50 percent by the year 2030, and there is no question that we need to do a better job on conservation, looking for alternative fuels; but this bill doesn't do that. This bill is not the bipartisan piece of legislation that we want. There is no bipartisan bill on the House floor. There is no Republican substitute. There were no Republican amendments. There was not even a conference named to try and iron out differences between the House and the Senate. Virtually, there was no Republican involvement or input on this legislation at all. And so, therefore, as a consequence, there are no Republicans at least on this side of the aisle that can make the bill bipartisan.  In 2005, we passed an important energy bill, and it was bipartisan. Chairman Barton did a terrific job in the hearings and the conference that we had, and it enjoyed the support then of Ranking Member Dingell to make sure that in fact it was bipartisan. But raising taxes, which this bill does, on energy producers is the last thing that our Nation needs as our consumers try and grapple with higher energy costs, whether that be heating or gasoline.  Yesterday, in an important hearing, my good friend from Michigan (Mr. Dingell) offered advice to the panel that was there when he took over the chairmanship of our important committee, Energy and Commerce. And he said this. He said: ``The Parliamentarian told me that the process needed to be fair and there needed to be a perception of fairness.'' Mr. Speaker, I lament that this bill is neither. It is not fair nor is the perception there.  I urge my colleagues on both sides to vote ``no.''
