 President, that is exactly what Senator Schumer said in committee, what I just read. That was what Senator Schumer said in committee. It was not clear from my notes who said it, but that is exactly what Senator Schumer said in committee:       And, explicitly I did not offer the currency amendment to      the TPA bill. We were told that it would not be part--if it      were part of TPA it might kill it.  Senator Schumer:       My goal is not to use currency to kill the TPA bill and not      to kill the TPA bill, it's to get currency passed.  Senator Schumer, further:       And that's why we offered it to the customs bill, on the      view, strong view, that no one disputed in committee that      we'd get a vote separately on the customs bill on the floor,      that it would come to the floor just like the other bills.  That is Senator Schumer in committee.
