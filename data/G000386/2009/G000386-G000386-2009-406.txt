 President, this is where you get the wool pulled over your eyes. Here we are, in the last moments of a very partisan debate, and we have one last vote to abandon further compromises we made in 2007. This one weakens fraud protection.  In that bill 2 years ago, we reached a carefully crafted compromise, balancing access and program integrity. With this amendment, the majority backs away from that compromise further. In 2007, we agreed that an express lane application would require a signature from the applicant acknowledging they were applying for Medicaid or SCHIP. This change eliminates the signature requirement.  It is not technical, it is substantive, and it is going to lead to fraud. We should vote this down because we don't want to promote fraud.
