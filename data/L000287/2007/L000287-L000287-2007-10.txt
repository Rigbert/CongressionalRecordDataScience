Madam Chairman, I want to thank my friend for yielding.  Madam Chairman, I for one fought too long and too hard to end discrimination based on race and color not to stand up against discrimination against our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters. During the 1960s, we broke down those signs that said ``white'' and ``colored.''  Call it what you may, to discriminate against someone because they are gay is wrong. It is wrong; it is not right. There is not any room in our society for discrimination. Today, we must take this important step after more than 30 long years and pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. It is the right thing to do. It is the moral thing to do.                              {time}  1615  Let us do it, not just for this generation, but for generations yet unborn.  Today, we have an opportunity to bring down those signs. Now is the time to do what is right, what is fair, what is just. The time is always right to do right. Let us pass this bill.
