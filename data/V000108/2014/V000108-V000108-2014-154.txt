Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Lieutenant Colonel Evan C. Ewachiw for his exceptional dedication to duty and service to the United States Army and to the United States of America. Lieutenant Colonel Evan Ewachiw will be transitioning from his present assignment as an Army Congressional Budget Liaison (SAFM-BUL) to serve as an operations research analyst for the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-1, United States Army.   A native of Fallston, Maryland, Lieutenant Colonel Ewachiw was accepted into the College of William and Mary's Reserve Officer Training Corps program in 1991 and, upon graduation in 1995, was commissioned a Regular Army Infantry Officer. LTC Ewachiw graduated with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Economics. He has subsequently earned Master's degrees in Legislative Affairs and Operations Research from the George Washington University and Florida Institute of Technology, respectively.   Lieutenant Colonel Evan Ewachiw's assignments have been diverse and include service within the Active Duty Army, as well as the Army National Guard. His assignments include Infantry Platoon Leader in B Company 1-503 Infantry, Camp Casey, the Republic of Korea; Information Management Officer, 10th Special Forces Group, Fort Carson, Colorado; Signal Detachment Commander and Battalion Signal Officer, 19th Special Forces Group, Colorado Army National Guard; Operations Research Analyst, National Guard Bureau, Arlington, Virginia; Army Congressional Fellow in the office of Representative John Culberson (TX-17); and most recently as a Congressional Budget Liaison Officer. Additionally, Lieutenant Colonel Ewachiw deployed to Kabul, Afghanistan, in 2002 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.   Lieutenant Colonel Ewachiw's leadership throughout his career has positively impacted his soldiers, peers, and superiors. As an Army Budget Liaison Officer for the past two years with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Financial Management and Comptroller, he worked directly with the House and Senate Appropriations Committees to educate and inform Representatives, Senators, and congressional staff about military and civilian personnel issues, force structure, operation and maintenance, and the Army Working Capital Fund. Additionally, he served as the Army's liaison to the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office.   Our country has been enriched by Lieutenant Colonel Ewachiw's extraordinary leadership, thoughtful judgment, and exemplary work. As a personal matter, I have benefited from his counsel and I deeply respect this officer for his dedication to serving others.   Mr. Speaker, it has been a pleasure to work with Lieutenant Colonel Evan C. Ewachiw during his time as an Army Congressional Budget Liaison. On behalf of a grateful nation, I join my colleagues today in recognizing and commending Lieutenant Colonel Evan Ewachiw for almost two decades of service to his country. We wish Evan, his wife Carrie, and his children Ana and Rhys all the best as they continue their journey in the United States Army.                          ____________________
