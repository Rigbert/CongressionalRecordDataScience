  If you will remember, my amendment, just read, would not fund the 12 additional Marine Corps generals that the Marine Corps wants, and the money is in this bill to do that. My argument, obviously, was as the number of marines has gone down from 199,000 to about 172,000 to 173,000, it seems to me that as we are downsizing, we should not be topsizing the administrative overhead from the standpoint of adding 12 more generals.  We have seen a reduction in the number of generals and admirals--maybe not enough--but we have seen a reduction in the other three forces. They still are not as efficient from the standpoint of the number of generals and admirals as the Marine Corps is.  Regardless of that, it seems to me inconsistent with balancing the budget, when the Secretary of Defense is pointing out to us the need for every dollar that we can get going into modernization, that we do not spend more money on administrative overhead. If 70 generals were in charge at the time there were 199,000, it seems to me we do not need 80 generals when we have 172,000 marines.  One argument that has been made by the Senate Armed Services Committee, the authorization committee, is that this issue should be decided in conference between the House and the Senate on the authorization bill and should not be a point to discuss when we have the Senate defense appropriations bill up.  I disagree with that, and I disagree with that because this is a legitimate appropriations matter. The Marine Corps requested 12 additional generals, and these generals do cost extra money. In fact, it involves a lot more money. That extra money is in the bill that is before the Senate right now. Regardless of what the Senate Armed Services Committee said, if the money is not in this bill, then the new generals do not get paid. Period. You cannot pay people if there is no money appropriated for it. You cannot pay these new generals based on the authorization bill. DOD cannot write one check based on an authorization.  The money is in the military personnel account. You can turn yourself, if you want to see it, to pages 6 and 7 of the committee report, and there you find a listing of the branches of the military, the number of people who are being funded by this legislation. You are not going to receive a paycheck if there is not money appropriated, because you cannot spend money in our Government without the consequence of an appropriations bill.  So these generals are expecting to be paid. They will only be paid if the money is in this bill, and my amendment would take that money out. It would leave the money to the Defense Department, hopefully to do what the Secretary of Defense said should be done, and that would be to modernize our military capability.  The last point--at least I think it will be the last point I will have to make because we have not had the debate on this amendment that I hoped we were going to have, particularly from people on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Most of their arguments have been procedure, that this is in their bailiwick, it should not be decided now. They have not been willing to state their case. Maybe somebody will come over here and do it, and I hope they will.  But the last point I want to make is that if there is a real need for additional personnel to be funded in the Marines, it is for more sergeants and more lieutenants, because those are the people who lead Marine platoons in battle. That is the place where there is a tremendous shortfall in the number of qualified people who are needed, and I will refer to a study in just a minute.  Earlier in this debate, I talked about the driving force behind the request for 12 more Marine Corps generals. I said even though the Marine Corps said that war fighting was the reason they needed more generals and even though the Senate Armed Services Committee said war fighting was not the reason for needing more generals, in either case, this cannot be justified because these positions are not going to war fighting, and it is not because of Goldwater-Nichols.  With all due respect, I think people who make these arguments are using smokescreens. If war fighting were the top priority, the Marine Corps would be adding more platoon sergeants, not more generals to fill the highest levelsin headquarters positions. I said the Marine Corps has a critical shortage of sergeants and lieutenants. I said that in one of my earlier statements today. These are the people, lower in the ranks, who train the force and keep it ready to go. If war breaks out, they would lead our platoons into battle.  Everyone knows that the heart and soul of the Marine Corps fighting force is its 27 infantry battalions. That is what the Marine Corps is all about. Everything the Marine Corps does is focused on moving, protecting and supporting those units. If those 27 battalions are not healthy, then the Marine Corps is not strong.  Well, a doctor has been examining the battalion's vital signs, and they are not up to snuff. I repeat what I said a moment ago, there is a critical shortage of platoon sergeants. That statement is based on an important piece of information. It is based on the Marine Corps briefing paper that I have in my hand, ``Making the Corps Fit to Fight.'' It is called a unit cohesion task force interim report.  This review was conducted by the unit cohesion task force in April of this year, just 3 months ago. It was under the leadership of Marine Col. G. S. Newbold.  I ask unanimous consent to print a portion of this briefings in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Making the Corps Fit To Fight--Unit Cohesion Task Force Interim Report              unit cohesion task force--col. g.s. newbold     MM       Sgt.

The Nation's 9-1-1 Force.                              the reality       Infantry Battalions are staffed at 57% of ASR requirements      for 0311 Sergeants.       The inventory of MPs/Corrections Marines exceeds that of      Artillerymen.       We have more Utilities Specialists than Tankers and      Amtrackers combined.       Less than 50% of Enlisted Marines remain with the same      Infantry Battalion for two deployments.                            officer reality       88% of Majors are not in the FMF.       Nearly 15% in Northern Virginia.       Only 11% of 0302 Lieutenants & 29% of 0302 Captains make      two deployments with the same Battalion.       Despite aviator shortage, nearly 52% of all aviators are      not in the FMF.                        reality from commanders       ...We had to pull our boat platoon from the CAX before      FINEX to get them to Little Creek to start the [MEU SOC]      cycle.       Our training cycle is not in sync with the personnel cycle.       Without stabilizing our ranks, cohesion's benefits are lost      and training is the equivalent of pouring water into a      bottomless bucket...       If maneuver warfare seeks to shatter the enemy's cohesion,      we must seek to strengthen our own as a matter of self-     protection.       I have lance corporals as platoon sergeants and sergeants      as platoon commanders.       Three weeks ago we went on a battalion run and fell out      with 121.       The concept that numbers are more important than morale,      cohesion etc., must be reconsidered.       We do have quality NCOs and SNCOs, but the best go off to      other key billets (DI/Recruiting).                          enabling philosophy       In order to fulfill its role as the Nation's crisis      response force, the Marine Corps will re-establish the      primacy of the operating forces by creating manpower and      training policies and programs that support cohesion and      stability.                         priorities (pillar 4)       The FMF will be manned at 90% of T/O--General C.E. Mundy,      Jr., 1990.       Reality--enlisted 88%; officers 84%.       ``Our system is geared to the success of individual careers      vice the success of individual units''                               principle       Since our heart and soul is our warfighting capability,      service in the FMF must be our top priority.
