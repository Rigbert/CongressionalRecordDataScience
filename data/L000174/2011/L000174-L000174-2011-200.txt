Well, Chairman Rogers is a Republican. I have worked with him a lot. He has always kept his word to me, just as we have the most decorated veteran of our military serving in either body as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, the only Medal of Honor recipient now serving, Senator Inouye. Both he and the ranking Republican, Senator Cochran, have always kept their word to me certainly in more than the third of a century I have served on that committee.  The America Invents Act, as passed by the House, continues to make important improvements. It ensures the fees collected by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office are used for Patent and Trademark Office activities. The one thing in there is that we in the Congress at least have a chance to make sure they are using it the way they are supposed to.  The office is entirely fee funded. It does not rely on taxpayer dollars. It has been and continues to be subject to the annual appropriations bill which allows the oversight that we are elected and paid for by the American people to do.  The legislation we passed in March would have taken the Patent Trademark Office out of the appropriations process by setting up a revolving fund. Instead of a revolving fund, the House formulation against fee diversion established a separate account and directs that account be used only by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The House Appropriations chairman is committed to abide by that legal framework. The Speaker is committed to that. The House forged a compromise. That is the essence of the legislative process.  The Founders knew when they wrote the Constitution to include the Great Compromise. Ideological purity does not lead to legislative enactments. Ideological purity does not lead to legislative enactments.  The House compromise can make a difference. It made real progress against fee diversion, which is something we can support. There are many companies and organizations that do support this in order to get the bill enacted without delay. After 6\1/2\ years, let's not delay any more.  This is going to create jobs. We have 600,000 to 700,000 patents sitting there waiting to be processed. Let's get on with it. For all of these fees and the reserve fund can only be used for the operations of the Patent and Trademark Office. I don't know what more we can do. But I would say I am perfectly willing to accept what the House did because it assures that the fees go to the Patent Office.  I am also well aware that voting for this amendment kills the bill. It could kill the bill over a formality--the difference between a reserve fund and a revolving fund.  I think the House Republican leadership worked out their compromise in good conscience, and I agree with it.  The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is funded entirely by user fees, and the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act will ensure the PTO has access to the fees it collects. We have heard from a number of organizations which agree with that, and I ask unanimous consent that a sample of these letters from the Business Software Alliance, the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, DuPont, and other financial organizations be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   Business Software Alliance,                                                    June 29, 2011.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Majority Leader,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Minority Leader,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Reid and Senator McConnell: We urge you to      bring H.R. 1249 to the Senate floor as soon as the Senate's      schedule permits.       The Business Software Alliance (BSA) strongly supports      modernizing our patent system. An efficient and well-     operating patent system is necessary to promote healthy and      dynamic innovation. Innovation is critically important to      software and computer companies' ability to provide new and      better tools and technologies to consumers and customers.       BSA member companies believe H.R. 1249 establishes a      transparent and efficient patent system. It will make the      Patent and Trademark Office more accessible and useful to all      inventors, large and small. In addition, the provisions of      H.R. 1249 on Patent and Trademark Office funding will ensure      that the user fees paid to the USPTO will be available to the      Office for processing patent applications and other important      functions of the Office.       H.R. 1249 and S. 23 are the products of many years of      skillful and difficult legislative work in both the House and      the Senate. H.R. 1249 represents a thoughtful and balanced      compromise that is endorsed by virtually all stakeholders. We      urge the Senate to adopt H.R. 1249 as acted upon by the House      and pass it without amendment as soon as possible.           Sincerely,                                              Robert W. Holleyman,     President and CEO.                                  ____                                                  SBE Council,                                        Oakton, VA, June 29, 2011.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: The Small      Business & Entrepreneurship Council (SBE Council) has been a      leading advocate for patent reform within the small business      community, and we urge you to work with the leadership of the      Senate to bring the America Invents Act (H.R. 1249) to the      Senate floor for approval.       H.R. 1249 would improve the patent system in key ways. For      example, the U.S. patent system would be brought in step with      the rest of the world. The U.S. grants patents on a first-to-     invent basis, rather than the first-inventor-to-file system      that the rest of the world follows. First-to-invent is      inherently ambiguous and costly, and that's bad news for      small businesses and individual inventors.       A shift to a ``first-inventor-to-file'' system creates      greater certainty for patents, and amounts to a far simpler      and more transparent system that would reduce costs in the      rare cases when conflict exists over who has the right to a      patent. By moving to a first-inventor-to-file system, small      firms will in no way be disadvantaged, as some claim, while      opportunities in international markets will expand.       In addition, an Associated Press report, for example, noted      ``that it takes an average of three years to get a patent      approved and that the agency has a backlog of 1.2 million      pending patents, including more than 700,000 that haven't      reached an examiner's desk.'' Part of the problem here is      that revenues from patent fees can be drained off by Congress      to be spent elsewhere.       The agreement reached in the House on USPTO funding will      assure that the fees paid to the USPTO by inventors will not      be diverted elsewhere, but instead be made available for      processing patent applications. While the Senate's approach      in S. 23 to prevent diversion of USPTO funds would have been      a better choice, the House bill still provides an effective      option.       Patent reform is needed to clarify and simplify the system;      to properly protect legitimate patents; and to reduce costs      in the system, including when it comes to litigation and the      international marketplace. All of this, of course, would aid      small businesses and the overall economy.       H.R. 1249, like S. 23, is a solid bill, and the opportunity      for long overdue and much-needed patent reform should not be      lost.       Thank you for considering the views of the small business      community. Please feel free to contact SBE Council with      questions or if we can be of assistance on this important      issue for small businesses.           Sincerely,                                                   Karen Kerrigan.                                                  President & CEO.                                       ____                                                       Dupont,                                     Wilmington, DE, July 6, 2011.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: As a world      leader in science and innovation, including agriculture and      industrial biotechnology, chemistry, biology, materials      science and manufacturing, DuPont recognizes the nation's      patent system is a cornerstone in fostering innovation and      creating jobs. Patents continue to be one of the engines for      innovation and a process for discovery that leads to rich,      new offerings for our customers and gives our company the      edge to continue transforming markets and society. Our stake      in the patent system is significant--in 2010, DuPont filed      over 2,000 patent applications and was awarded almost 700      U.S. patents. Given the importance of its patents, DuPont has      been a strong supporter of efforts to implement patent reform      legislation that will improve patent quality and give the      U.S. Patent and Trademark Office the resources it needs to      examine and grant patents in a timely manner.       We believe that any changes to the patent system need to be      made in a way that strengthens patents and supports the      important goals of fostering innovation and creating jobs. In      our view, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, H.R. 1249,      achieves these objectives, and we urge you to consider      adoption of this bill.       The agreement reached in the House on USPTO funding will      assure that the fees paid to the USPTO by inventors will not      be diverted and will be made available to the Office for      processing patent applications and other important functions      of the Office. While we would have preferred the Senate's      approach in S. 23 to prevent diversion of USPTO funds, we      believe that acceptance of the House bill provides an      effective and the most immediate path forward to address      problems of the patent office. H.R. 1249, like S. 23, is an      excellent bill. These bills are the product of many years of      skillful and difficult legislative work in both the House and      the Senate. We believe the time has now come for the Senate      to take the final legislative act required for enactment of      these historic reforms.       We look forward to patent reform becoming a reality in the      112th Congress, due in significant measure to your      leadership, and we thank you for your efforts in this      critical policy area.           Very truly yours,     P. Michael Walker,       Vice President, Assistant General Counsel and Chief      Intellectual Property Counsel.                                  ____                                                    June 29, 2011.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Leaders Reid and McConnell: We are writing to      encourage you to bring H.R. 1249, the ``Leahy-Smith America      Invents Act,'' to the Senate floor at your earliest possible      convenience and send the bill to the President's desk to be      signed into law. H.R. 1249 closely mirrors the Senate bill      that passed earlier this year by an overwhelming 95-5 vote.       Patent reform is essential legislation: enactment will spur      innovation creating jobs and ensure that the Patent and      Trademark Office (PTO) has the tools necessary to maintain      our patent system as the best in the world. We strongly      support the improved re-examination procedures in H.R. 1249,      which will allow the experts at PTO to review low-quality      business-method patents against the best prior art. Equally      important, the bill provides the PTO with increased and      predictable funding. This certainty is absolutely critical if      the PTO is to properly allocate resources and hire and retain      the expertise necessary to benefit the entire user-community.       This bill has been nearly a decade in the making and is      supported by a vast cross-section of all types of inventors      and businesses. It is time to send patent reform to the      President for signature, and we strongly encourage the Senate      to take up and pass H.R. 1249 without delay.           Sincerely,         American Bankers Association, American Council of Life            Insurers, American Financial Services Association,            American Insurance Association, The Clearing House            Association, Consumer Bankers Association, Credit Union            National Association, The Financial Services            Roundtable, The Independent Community Bankers of            America, Mortgage Bankers Association, National            Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, Property            Casualty Insurers Association of America, Securities            Industry and Financial Markets Association.
