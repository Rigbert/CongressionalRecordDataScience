Last month, one such advocate in the marchfor peace in Ireland, Robert J. Dunfey, Sr., passed away.  Bob Dunfey was a successful businessman, the founder of what today we call the Omni Hotel chain, who gave back to his community, his state, his country and his world. A public servant who spent decades advancing peace-building efforts in his ancestral home of Ireland, Mr. Dunfey was widely regarded by leaders of all walks in Ireland. He worked to support initiatives in Northern Ireland, as well as those in Ireland. A trusted partner, Bob Dunfey sought neither credit nor the spotlight; he worked behind the scenes, a true hallmark of public service.  Marcelle and I were touched when Bob welcomed us and our family into his home in Ballyferriter, Ireland. He leaves behind family and friends in his native New England, across the country and around the world. His is a friendship I will miss.  I ask unanimous consent that the full obituary for Robert Dunfey, Sr., be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:   Obituary for Robert J. Dunfey Sr., Co-Founder, Omni-Dunfey Hotels            International and Peace-Builder, Northern Ireland       Robert John `Bob' Dunfey, Sr. of Portsmouth, NH and      formerly of Cape Elizabeth, ME, died peacefully on Tuesday,      August 23, 2016, surrounded by loving family including his      devoted wife, Jeanette Marston Dunfey who tirelessly cared      for him during his long and valiant struggle against      Parkinson's Disease.       Bob was born February 9, 1928 in Lowell, MA, the seventh of      twelve children of Catherine and LeRoy Dunfey. He was      educated at St. Patrick's School and Keith Academy, both in      Lowell.       He is survived by former wife Shirley (Corey) Dunfey, and      five children: Robert Dunfey, Jr. Cape Elizabeth, ME; Roy and      Karen Dunfey, Portland, ME; Eileen Dunfey and Michael      Pulsifer, Cape Elizabeth, ME; Brian Dunfey, South Berwick,      ME; Maryanne Dunfey, North Conway, NH; 10 grandchildren and 3      great-grandchildren.       He is also survived by 4 of his 11 siblings: Jack and his      wife Lisa of Boston; Eileen Robinson of Bradenton, FL; Jerry      and his wife Nadine Hack of Lutry, Switzerland; Eleanor      Dunfey and her husband Jim Freiburger of Exeter, NH; many      dear cousins in Ballyferriter, Co. Kerry, Ireland; and his      wife Jeanette's devoted Marston family.       He was pre-deceased by his parents Catherine and LeRoy and      7 Dunfey siblings: Roy, Paul, Catherine, `Kay,' Mary, William      `Bud,' and Richard, `Dick,' and Walter.       Rarely in the 88 years of Bob Dunfey's life was he in or      did he seek the limelight, but a look behind the scenes in      meetings, conversations, and telephone calls would reveal      Bob's signature contributions. The seventh child in a family      of 12 knew from the beginning that his life would be that of      bridge builder, connector, supporter of worthy causes.       Too young to enlist in WWII with his older brothers, he      became the indispensable ``right hand'' for his father and      role model for his younger siblings by doing the often      thankless hard work--behind the counter in the family's      luncheonette and variety store in Lowell, MA's `ACRE,' the      home of so many first generation Irish and other immigrants.      To this day, his closest friend and partner, brother Jack,      credits Bob's energy and hard work as the distinct factor      that grew the family business from one small business to      fried clam stands at Hampton Beach then on to restaurants,      motels and hotels throughout New England, an evolution which      led to the purchase of Boston's famous Parker House in 1968      and later became Omni Hotels International.       Bob's work in the business community had a significant      impact on the Maine economy. In 1966 Bob successfully led the      controversial campaign to allow restaurants, lounges and      hotels to sell alcoholic beverages on Sunday which was      prohibited by law. Another major contribution was the      development of the Maine Mall.       During Bobby Kennedy's 1968 campaign for President, Bobby      would personally call Bob each Sunday to hear how the      campaign was going in Maine. In 1980, on behalf of Maine      Governor Brennan, Bob asked Federal Judge George Mitchell to      fill the senate seat of Edmund Muskie, newly appointed      Secretary of State by President Carter. Mitchell accepted.       As an active father he helped raise his family in Cape      Elizabeth. His favorite places were Prout's Neck walking the      beach and the bird walk, boating around Casco Bay and riding      his bike along the New England Coast. In 1965, he built a ski      chalet in North Conway where his family and grandchildren      spent winter weekends skiing Cranmore Mountain and      snowmobiling, He also arranged many family ski trips to Vail      at Thanksgiving.       But his pride and joy was the house he had built in      Ballyferriter, Ireland with the most amazing view of ocean      and cliffs. His purpose was to have new generations of family      reconnect with Irish relatives. His school master and      archeologist cousin, Denis O'Connor helped Bob select the      perfect Irish name: Feorann: ``edge of the sea, a verdant      bank on a mountainside . . .'' Over 35 years, Bob expanded      that word's meaning to include: a bit of heaven to be shared      with all! He generously opened his Irish home to family,      countless friends--even friends of friends. He introduced      Senators George Mitchell, Ted Kennedy, Patrick Leahy, and      Chris Dodd to the expansive beauty and warm hospitality of      the Dingle Peninsula. Bob believed as every Kerryman does,      that there are only two kingdoms: The Kingdom of God and The      Kingdom of Kerry; ``One is of this world and one is out of      this world!''       Robert J. `Bob' Dunfey, Sr. was a trustee of the University      of Maine System; a director of the American Ireland Funds;      founder and honorary director of the Susan L. Curtis      Foundation, which operates a 50-acre summer camp for Maine's      underprivileged children. Bob was a founding director of the      Maine Community Foundation. Bob served on the Spurwink Board      of Trustees for 14 years, and was honored as the inaugural      Humanitarian of the Year in 1987.       He was founding treasurer and director of New England      Circle/Global Citizens Circle, a 40-year old non-profit forum      that brings leaders and activists together for civil dialogue      on critical issues that lead to constructive change in our      local and global communities. Bob worked tirelessly to      support initiatives in Northern Ireland and cultural      preservation projects in the South of Ireland. For his      extraordinary efforts over 40 years on the Isle of Ireland,      he was honored with several major awards by all the Parties      to the Peace Process as a trusted behind the scenes partner      for all who were interested in moving beyond ``The      Troubles.''       He was an advisor for the White House Conference for Trade      and Investment in Northern Ireland. He participated with Sen.      George Mitchell, President Clinton's Special Envoy for      Economic Initiatives for Northern Ireland, on the Senator's      first tour of Belfast, Derry, and Border Towns.       Bob and his brother, Jack Dunfey, traveled to Oslo with      John Hume and David Trimble and their families when the two      Northern Ireland leaders were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize      in 1998.       Perhaps it is in the reflections of others that we see the      worth of a life well lived. Julia Brown, Bob's granddaughter,      offers such a reflection and two dear friends warmly affirm      her tribute: ``Our Papa leaves an amazing legacy as a      humanitarian and activist. He touched so many lives and made      such a memorable impact in this world. He will be immensely      missed by his loving family and wide circle of friends.'' One      of those dear and longtime friends, Jackie Redpath, Belfast      Shankill Community Centre, who worked so closely alongside      Bob, shares that sentiment: ``Bob was a `great man'. In      Ireland, in Belfast, on the Shankill Falls, he straddled      `both sides' & both extremes & I am forever grateful for his,      and your family's, bringing loyalism/unionism' in from the      cold and giving us a seat `at the top table' in the United      States. People are alive today, who would not otherwise be,      on account of this. Bob was strong, sincere, determined,      wise, sensitive and great damn fun. He was very kind to me      and I will miss him.       It was his beloved Maine, however, that Bob served first      and foremost, and the Susan Curtis Foundation expresses best,      all that Bob Dunfey means to them: ``It may comfort you to      know that this summer, nearly 500 youth learned about      themselves and who they can be, while developing the      character, skills and life lessons they need to reach their      dreams. Over 16,000 youth have had that same experience since      Camp Susan Curtis opened its doors in 1974. None of this      would have happened without Bob. He lives on in the thousands      of Maine youth (and former Maine youth--now adults!) who are      succeeding and thriving in part because they mattered at Camp      Susan Curtis. He will forever be a part of us and we will      miss him.''       A celebration of Bob's life will be held at St. John's      Episcopal Church, 100 Chapel Street, Portsmouth, NH at 11      A.M. Saturday, September 10, 2016. Honoring Bob's wish, his      ashes will be interred in the family's ancestral grave in      Ballyferriter, Ireland alongside his sister, Mary; brother,      Walter; and nephew, Philip, at a time convenient to the      family. The family requests that, in lieu of flowers, friends      consider a contribution in Bob's memory to the Susan Curtis      Foundation 1321 Washington Ave # 104, Portland, ME 04103.                          ____________________
