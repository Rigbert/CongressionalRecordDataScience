President, I am going to close by saying that for those who wonder if it makes any difference whether we move forward on the issue of helping the unemployed, they should read this article I have put in the Record. People across this country are not only worried about getting a job and taking care of their families, it has reached a point where it is dramatic. Some of them are making critical life decisions, spending their savings, with no health insurance to cover themselves or their kids.  I will ask the Republicans, who will follow me: Please, regardless of how long you want to talk today, agree with us that we should move quickly to fund our troops, send the money for those members of the military and their families to give them peace of mind we stand behind them. Do not make them part of any political delay and strategy that leaves uncertainty. Let's do it today. Let's not wait until the money runs out tomorrow.  Let's fund our unemployment benefits too. Let's give these families, who through no fault of their own are out of work, the peace of mind of knowing that as we go home for Christmas, they will at least have a Christmas which has, even if it is small, an unemployment check.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Iowa is recognized.
