President, I rise this evening, along with my good friend, the distinguished senior Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, to introduce the Teacher Tax Relief Act of 2001. We are very pleased to be joined by the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Allen, and Senators Cochran and Landrieu, as original cosponsors of our legislation. All of these Senators are strong advocates for education and for our Nation's teachers.  It would be difficult to script a more appropriate time for us to introduce this important legislation. We stand now at the summit of an education debate that began over 2 weeks ago. At the same time, we anticipate a major tax relief bill to which we will turn our attention as early as tomorrow.  Our bill is related to both. It is both sound education policy and sensible tax policy. We plan on offering it as an amendment to the tax bill as soon as feasible on the Senate floor.  For that reason, Senator Warner and I wanted to take advantage of this time this evening to talk a little bit about our bill and the ensuing amendment. In the midst of the education and tax debates, we are asking the Senate not to overlook the selfless efforts of our teachers and the many financial sacrifices they make to improve their instructional skills and the classrooms where they teach. Senator Warner deserves tremendous credit for focusing our attention, through a sense-of-the-Senate amendment to the education bill, on the need to provide tax relief for our Nation's teachers.  Our teachers serve such a critical role in the education and development of our children. In fact, study after study demonstrates that other than involved parents, a high-quality, dedicated teacher is the single most important prerequisite for student success.  The amendment which Senator Warner offered earlier this past week, and which I was proud to cosponsor, expressed the sense of the Senate that Congress should pass legislation providing teachers with tax relief in recognition of the many out-of-pocket expenses, unreimbursed expenses they incur to improve the education of our children. The bill we introduce today is legislation very similar to Senator Warner's amendment which was adopted by the Senate by a vote of 95-3.  The bill we introduce today is targeted to support the expenditures of teachers who strive for excellence beyond the constraints of what their schools can provide.  Earlier this year, Senator Warner, Senator Hatch, and I each introducedour own version of our teacher tax relief bills. Last year Senator Kyl and I teamed up in a similar way. We have now all come together behind the Teacher Tax Relief Act of 2001, which enjoys bipartisan support from our colleagues as well as the endorsement of the National Education Association.  Our bill has two major provisions. First, it will allow teachers, teachers' aides, principals, and counselors to take an above-the-line deduction for their professional development expenses. I have talked with teachers in Maine who have financed continuing education courses at the master's and doctoral level as well as seminars out of their pocket. They then came back to their schools and shared their knowledge with their colleagues, and that additional course work has made them better teachers.  Some school districts reimburse for those kinds of professional development expenses. It would be great if they all did. But some school districts simply don't have the resources to help teachers who are striving to improve their skills.  What our bill will do is help those teachers who are financing those educational expenses out of their own pockets by giving them an above-the-line tax deduction.  The second provision of our bill will grant educators a tax credit of up to $250 for books, supplies, and equipment they purchase for their students. The tax credit would be set at 50 percent of such expenditures so that teachers would receive 50 cents of tax relief for every dollar of their own money they spend for supplies for their classroom.  It is remarkable how much the average teacher spends every year out of his or her own pocket to buy supplies and other materials for their students. According to a study by the National Education Association, the average public school teacher spends more than $400 annually on classroom materials.  Just recently, I met with Idella Harter, president of the Maine Education Association. She told me of the books, rewards for student behavior, and other materials she routinely purchases for her classroom. One year Idella decided to save her receipts to see how much she actually was spending. She said she started adding up the receipts and was startled to discover they totaled over $1,000. When they got that high, she decided to stop counting. But she continues to this day to purchase supplies and materials for her students.  When you think that the average teacher is not particularly well paid, it speaks volumes about their dedication that they are willing to make that kind of investment to improve the teaching for their students.  Idella is not alone. Maureen Marshall, who handles education issues for me in my office, taught public school for several years in Hawaii and Virginia. In her first year as a teacher, she, too, spent more than $1,000 of her own money on educational software, books, pocket charts to assist with language arts instruction, and other materials. Because of her tax situation, she could not deduct any of these expenses from her taxable income.  The ultimate beneficiaries of efforts to provide financial assistance to our teachers are our students. Our bill provides tax relief for up to $1,000 spent out of pocket by teachers for professional development and for supplies. These are teachers who are going the extra mile for our children, for our students.  Our bill makes it a priority to reimburse educators for just a small part of what they invest in our children's future.  I hope our colleagues will join us in support of this important initiative. I hope they will join us in a resounding vote when Senator Warner and I offer this proposal as an amendment to the upcoming tax bill.                                 ______                                       By
