President, I rise today to commend the Women's Business Development Center for the vital role it has played in accelerating women's business ownership and strengthening the impact that women have made on our economy.  The Women's Business Development Center is a nationally-recognized not-for-profit center devoted to providing services and programs that support and increase women's business ownership. Founded in 1986, more than 30,000 business owners in six States, including my home State of Illinois, have benefited from the program. The services range from counseling to workshops to entrepreneurial training.  Today, thanks to efforts by organizations such as the Women's Business Development Center, there are over 7.7 million women-owned businesses in the United States, generating $2.3 trillion in sales. Women business owners now employ one in every four U.S. company workers. There is no doubt that women in business today are playing a prominent role in stimulating economic growth both at home and abroad.  On September 12 of this year the Women's Business Development Center will celebrate its 11th anniversary. As the Center moves into its second decade of service to women business owners, I am proud to recognize its impressive achievements.                          ____________________
