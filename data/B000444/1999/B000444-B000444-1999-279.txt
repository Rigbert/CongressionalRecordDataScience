 President, I will be necessarily brief.  It is not often I disagree with my friend from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter. I think he is right in the fundamental sense that if the President is going to send American ground forces into a war, it needs congressional authority.  Very honestly, this amendment is, in my view, flawed. First of all, it is clear that the President has to come to Congress to use ground forces and that the President has already stated--I will ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a copy of his letter dated April 28, 1999, to the Speaker of the House in which he says in part:       Indeed, without regard to our differing constitutional      views on the use of force, I would ask for Congressional      support before introducing U.S. ground forces into Kosovo      into a non-permissive environment.  I ask unanimous consent that the President's letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              The White House,                                       Washington, April 28, 1999.     Hon. J. Dennis Hastert,     Speaker of the House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Speaker: I appreciate the opportunity to continue      to consult closely with the Congress regarding events in      Kosovo.       The unprecedented unity of the NATO Members is reflected in      our agreement at the recent summit to continue and intensify      the air campaign. Milosevic must not doubt the resolve of the      NATO alliance to prevail. I am confident we will do so      through use of air power.       However, were I to change my policy with regard to the      introduction of ground forces, I can assure you that I would      fully consult with the Congress. Indeed, without regard to      our differing constitutional views on the use of force, I      would ask for Congressional support before introducing U.S.      ground forces into Kosovo into a non-permissive environment.      Milosevic can have no doubt about the resolve of the United      States to address the security threat to the Balkans and the      humanitarian crisis in Kosovo. The refugees must be allowed      to go home to a safe and secure environment.           Sincerely,                                                     Bill Clinton.
