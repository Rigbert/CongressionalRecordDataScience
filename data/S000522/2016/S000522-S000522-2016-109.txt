Martin Luther King's niece Alveda King has had two abortions. She made one of the most passionate comments and speeches I have ever heard when she said: How can my uncle's dream survive if we murder the children? She is now pro-life. She says: The other co-victim in every abortion besides the baby is the mom. And she is a victim herself.  I yield to the gentleman from Illinois, Peter Roskam, a great leader on pro-life, first in the legislature in Illinois, and now here in Washington.
