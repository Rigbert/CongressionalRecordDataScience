Speaker, I think it is unfortunate that whenever you are on the short end of the argument, you end up demeaning the other side's arguments, getting involved in name calling. And that is not what the legislative process should be, but unfortunately, in many instances it is.  What the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Hoekstra] said is what the issue is before this House. The issue is whether the decision on what waivers should be approved or not rests with bureaucrats in the Department of Health and Human Services, who are not elected, who are not responsible to the voters and who are not even responsible to the President of the United States, or whether the decision should be made by the elected representatives of the people in the Wisconsin State Legislature. It is those State senators and those State representatives that have determined that this is a good idea for the people of Wisconsin.  If it has been misrepresented, they are the folks that ought to take the political hit, because they are responsible for their voting record, just as we are responsible for ours. So let us have some faith in those elected senators and representatives by approving this bill and providing the waivers that are needed to make this work.
