 President, today is the last day of the session for the Senate pages who served during the spring semester. I want to thank them for their hard work and service to the Senate over the last 4 months. I wish you all well as you return to your home States with a greater appreciation for the Senate and our work here.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the list of pages graduating this week be printed in the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Meg Balaji       Elizabeth Bates       Craig Birckhead-Morton       Jackson Cargill       Olivia Castilla       Michael Cathy       Brooke Culp       William Deaton       Gabe Fanning       Caroline Ferry       Cameron Fowler       Sophie Hart       Laura Hartman       Ruthie Kesri       Joe Lesser       Dan McDermott       George Moore       Virginia Pillion       Katerina Retzlaff       Bella Sandoval-Encinas       Matthew Shabino       Caleb Shriver       Hunter Steinlage       Kara Swain       Colby Switser       Teagan Thompson       John Wahlig III       Jamie Yoder  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I might just add that, frequently, it is difficult to go back to boring high school. So I hope you are all able to acclimate yourselves to the real world again and always remember your experience here in the greatest deliberative body in the world.                          ____________________
