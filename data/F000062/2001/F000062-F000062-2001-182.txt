 President, I associate myself with the comments made by the Senator from Connecticut. If the budget comes back as reports indicate the conference may send it back, I, who voted for it the first time, will not be able to vote to support that budget conference report.  The Senator from Connecticut has very well made the points. For me, it is a profound disappointment that something I thought we had worked out and was understood is going to be reversed and come back in a conference report which is, for most of us, unacceptable.  Mr. President, I know the hour of 2 o'clock is approaching. I ask unanimous consent that the time be extended just so I may finish my comments today.
