Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank the chairman and commend my colleagues in both Chambers, specifically Mr. Hudson and Mr. Butterfield, for working on this bill. The legislation enjoys support from both sides of the aisle on this committee; and, in fact, the House version of the bill, H.R. 3477, passed both the Energy Subcommittee and the full Energy and Commerce Committee by a voice vote with almost no debate. Similarly, the Senate companion, which is before us now, passed that body by unanimous consent. I hope that we can do the same today and swiftly send this to the President's desk for his signature.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the passage of S. 2030.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
