  First, I thank the Republican leader Senator McConnell for his kind words. Also I thank my friend, the majority leader, Senator Reid, for helping bring us where we are today.  But more than that, I commend Senator Dodd, the chairman of the Banking Committee, with whom I have worked for years and years. We have worked exceedingly closely on many issues dealing with the Banking Committee. What we are bringing to the floor now is something very complex, very far reaching. The idea that something should be too big to fail is very important to me. Nothing should be too big to fail, in my judgment, in this country.  I commend Senator Dodd. In our negotiations, they haven't been all loss--we have reached some assurances in that. He and his staff have made some recommendations that we like. We made some they liked. I think we have made real progress. I know we have to seal it all, but I think Senator Dodd is working in good faith on that.  But we have the derivatives title and we have the consumer products deal. We have not been able to resolve those yet. I hope we will on the floor of the Senate. We have moved to a new forum and it is going to be a very important debate in the weeks ahead here because this is very important to the American people.
