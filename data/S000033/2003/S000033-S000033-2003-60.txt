 Chairman, in terms of the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey), what I would say with regard to his asking us to give notice, I did not have warning. I turned on the television and found this bill on the floor of the House. Nobody gave us warning this bill was coming to the floor of the House.  Second of all, this is a legislative body. I know the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf) is a fair man, and if other people have missed their amendments, presumably because this bill has moved so fast, maybe we should give them a chance to have their amendments discussed and debated. That is what we are supposed to do.  This is an enormously important issue. Let us have that debate. Let us have those votes.  But I have to tell my colleagues that on an issue of this importance, I am going to be fighting for it, and I am not going to give up. We are going to have a vote on this.
