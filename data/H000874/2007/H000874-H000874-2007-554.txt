 Having been in the gentleman's position for too long, I honestly empathize with his position. It is my expectation that the appropriation bills, as they have historically, will come to this floor starting mid-May and continuing through June, and we hope to complete our appropriations bills by the end of June. My expectation is they will be, as they are traditionally, on the floor with open rules, or at least structured rules. Obviously, open rules, if you have 500 or 600 amendments from allthe folks, we may not get finished, which is why we have structured rules. But certainly the gentleman is correct that that is the tradition. I would expect us to follow that tradition.  On supplementals, over the last 15 supplementals, I was looking around to see if I had it immediately in front of me, I don't, but on the last 15 supplementals there have been a variety. Seven of them were open, eight of them were less than open, some more structured than others.  I understand the gentleman's representation, and I certainly look forward to working with the gentleman.
