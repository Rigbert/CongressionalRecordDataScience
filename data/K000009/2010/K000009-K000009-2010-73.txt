I know what a long day you have had. You began on C-SPAN this morning, I believe, and you have worked way overtime today. And to join us here this evening and to pay tribute particularly with your responsibilities in the area of defense, I know that the people of Poland are listening and Polish Americans across this country and they are helped at this very, very weighty moment to be healed by your words, by the words of Congressman Donnelly.  Today, we were all a part of that very, very important moment when the congressman from Chicago, Congressman Dan Lipinski, who co-chairs the Polish Caucus in the Congress, asked for a moment of silence, and Speaker Pelosi was at the rostrum, and the entire Chamber rose above partisanship. It was just the expression of the American people, as the Ambassador from Poland, Robert Kupiecki, was in the gallery, and we remembered those who'd lost their lives. And we prayed for the strength of Poland today, for the courage of her people to endure.  As we were expressing that respect, I kept thinking to my last trip to Poland, which was last August, and I have traveled there for many, many decades when it was under Communist control, and I remember how the people--how their faces, their eyes, their expressions were. And then in 1989 when the Berlin Wall came down, traveling to Poland and seeing this moment of possibility and the anxiousness at that particular period, and then to travel there last August and to see a new generation of Poland. I get pretty emotional thinking about it.  And to see their eyes, the eyes of the young people who are going to be the leaders of the 21st century and they have been raised in a free country for the first time in over a century. And they have the same possibility as the Poles who right after World War I attempted to build a free country, and then it was taken away from them by Nazi and Soviet aggression. So this is really the first generation.  And to see in 20 years the look of hope in those young people's eyes, I shall never forget it. And it told me that the world had progressed and that Poland had progressed and her deepest-held dreams lived in these young people.  So I wanted to put that on the record tonight and also to mention that many, many Members, certainly the Speaker, the Vice President, Secretary of State, Members of our House, like Congressman Quigley, have worked their way to the Polish Embassy to sign the book of mourning that is at the Embassy for interested members and citizens.  The Polish Embassy is overwhelmed with the outpouring of support and friendship of the American people. The street, 16th Street, just north of Dupont Circle, where the Embassy is located, the whole entire front is full of flowers and candles. Americans were walking by. They were attempting to gain entry to the Embassy to express their sorrow. It was quite a powerful sight to behold.  And I know that there are memorials being held around the globe as well. President Obama has announced he will be leading America's delegation to Poland this weekend for the President's funeral. So the outpouring of love from the American people to the Polish people is a bond that will only be strengthened by this great tragedy.  I wanted to also place on the Record, if I could, this evening a poem by Andrzej Wajda, who is a Polish filmmaker, about Katyn where the past generation and this generation of Poles has now paid the greatest price:  ``There are no Great Walls there at Katyn,  No towers leaning or not leaning,  Declaring some king's success  Or mocking another's failure,  No gleaming cathedral where  You can pray for forgiveness  Or watch the cycle of shadows play  Through the coolness of the day,  And soon not even the names  Of those who died will be remembered,  Names like Skrzypinski, Chmura,  Or Anthony Milczarek.  Their harsh voices and tearing courage  Are already lost in the wind,  But their true monuments  Will always be there, in the dust  And the gray ashes and the mounds  Settling over the bodies over which  No prayers were ever whispered,  No tears shed by a grieving mother  Or a trembling sister.''  This team of Polish leaders journeyed to Katyn, Russia, in order to begin to unravel this story of where history lived that for seven decades, three-quarters of a century, was denied. And I have to say that the Prime Minister of Russia, Vladimir Putin, is to be commended royally for his attention to what happened and, in addition to that, for having the courage to look history in the eye and not be afraid of it and to know that we are living in a new millennium and to allow the film Katyn by Andrzej Wajda to be shown on television in Russia before the crash and then after.                              {time}  1915  And so to make history right, and the President of Russia, Mr. Medvedev, to be able to move on and to work together with the deep heritage that our peoples all have together and to use our power to make the world a better place, what a moment for all of us to be living, and an opportunity, a set of opportunities that should not be lost.  And I would like to yield back to my friend from Indiana (Mr. Donnelly).
