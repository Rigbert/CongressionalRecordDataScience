 President, I ask unanimous consent that a posting by someone under the name ``Blue Bunting'' made to the Care2 News Network be printed in the Record. This posting is a supplement to a speech I gave last Thursday, April 12, on attempts by some Democrats to elude responsibility for tax relief permanence.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                       [From Care2 News Network]                    The Monster Republican Tax Hike                                comments       Blue Bunting: Tuesday April 3, 2007, 8:32 pm       Last week I made a note to link to this post at Obsidian      Wings. I just spotted the note.       Hilzoy notes the commentary in some quarters that:       Following the example set by their Senate brethren last      Friday, House Democrats will adopt a budget resolution      containing the largest tax increase in U.S. history amid      massive national inattention.       Bet you didn't know that, eh? The Dems are already pushing      through the largest tax increase in U.S. history! and nobody      is paying attention!       Anyway, Hilzoy digs a bit further into the story. It really      is worth reading.       Long story short . . . Republican Congresses chose not to      make their tax cuts (or, as PGL would note, their tax      deferments) permanent. They didn't have to put in a sunset      clause--they chose to, in an attempt to make long term      projections look better. Even with that obfuscation, the      situation no longer looks quite so rosy. But . . . if the new      Democratic Congress doesn't do what the Republican Congresses      that preceded it failed to do, namely make the tax cut      permanent, well, that's the equivalent of the Democrats      pushing the largest tax increase in history.       Maybe it's just me . . . but since this whole thing was      planned and executed by a Republican Congress under a      Republican President, shouldn't we be referring to this as      the Republican's tax increase? And my bet is that there are a      lot of Republicans in Congress now, and that will be seeking      re-election some time soon, that voted for this massive tax      increase.       Blue Bunting: Tuesday April 3, 2007, 9:07 pm       Fact Check       Robert Novak wrote this in today's Washington Post:       ``Following the example set by their Senate brethren last      Friday, House Democrats will adopt a budget resolution      containing the largest tax increase in U.S. history amid      massive national inattention.       Nobody's tax payment will increase immediately, but the      budget resolutions set a pattern for years ahead. The House      version     would increase non-defense, non-emergency spending by $22.5      billion for next fiscal year, with such spending to rise 2.4      percent in each of the next three years. To pay for these      increases, the resolution would raise taxes by close to $400      billion over five years--about $100 more than what was passed      in the Senate.''       Heavens, I said to myself, what can Robert Novak possibly      be talking about? The Democrats budget (pdf, h/t The Gavel)      does not actually contain any tax increases:       And yet this claim that the Democrats' budget contains a      tax increase is being cited all over the place. So what's up?       Novak gives us a clue:       ``It had been assumed that the new Democratic majority      would end President Bush's relief in capital gains dividend      and estate taxation. The simultaneous rollback of Bush-     sponsored income tax cuts was a surprise.''       Ah, Rolling back the Bush tax cuts. But wouldn't that still      require some actual changes in revenues from the baseline      projections? A GOP Budget Caucus press release gives us      further details:       Note that word `automatic'. It's quite worrying. How did      the Democrats manage to create an automatic tax increase?      Don't tax increases normally have to be enacted? I hope so.      It would be awful if tax increases could just happen      automatically. Come to think of it, it would be even worse if      it turns out that this isn't confined to the tax code, and      all sorts of laws could be passed automatically. I mean, who      knows what the U.S. Code might decide to do to itself,      without the intervention of any human agent? We could wake up      one morning to find that ping pong had been automatically      criminalized, or that a requirement that all Americans wear      silly clown costumes had automatically come into force, or      that all our national parks had automatically sold themselves      to WalMart. The possibilities are horrifying.       Imagine my relief when I realized what was actually going      on. The Bush tax cuts are set to expire automatically. They      were written that way. What the Democrats are proposing to do      is simply not to change this.       Moreover, guess who wrote these sunset provisions into the      tax increases? The Republicans, that's who. They were trying      to make the tax increases seem less fiscally ruinous than      they were, so they made them last only so long before they      expired. (This is why I expect 2010 to produce a spike in      mortality among the very rich; the heirs of people who die      during 2010 pay no estate tax; the heirs of people who die in      2011 pay 50% on all the money they inherit above the level at      which the estate tax kicks in. As Paul Krugman said, ``That      creates some interesting incentives. Maybe they should have      called it the Throw Momma From the Train Act of 2001.'')       So here's what Novak's ``largest tax increase in U.S.      history'' actually comes to the Republicans passed a series      of tax cuts that they set up to expire. They intended to make      them permanent, but never got around to it. The Democrats are      proposing to leave their tax cuts alone. But this counts as a      tax increase, apparently on the grounds that whatever      Republicans sorta kinda thought they were going to do, but      never actually got around to doing, counts as already done,      and anyone who proposes to leave things alone counts as      undoing the things they were intending to do.       That's a fun way to think. Maybe we should also count the      Democrats as having dramatically increased the budget      deficit, on the grounds that the Republicans kinda sorta said      they were going to make it go away, so even though they      didn't, we should act as though they did and compare whatever      deficits the Democrats incur to the Republicans' imaginary      balanced budget. Maybe, if things in Iraq continue to go      badly, we should compare that not to the situation when the      Democrats took over, but to the situation that would have      obtained if the Republicans had in fact produced a beacon of      democracy that transformed the Middle East, and say: hey, you      awful Democrats, we were being greeted with flowers and      candy, and hailed as liberators, and now look what's happened      to Baghdad!!!!       Or maybe we should try living in the real world. The      Democrats are proposing to leave tax laws written and enacted      by Republicans alone. That does not count as increasing      taxes.
