Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to John M. (Mike) Henry who is retiring after a long and distinguished career of public service. A dedicated and selfless individual, Mike has served as County Coordinator for Berrien County for the past sixteen years. During his tenure, Mike assisted the citizens of Southwest Michigan in a number of capacities, all with great distinction.  Since 1988, Mike's contributions to our community have been tremendous. He has consistently received accolades and recognition for his inspired work. During his time as County Coordinator, Mike crafted, managed and executed budgets exceeding $2 billion, had the unique ability to manage large sums of public funds--always meeting the highest level of auditing standards, and exhibited great competence and success in working with the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government.  In addition to his remarkable service to Berrien County, Mike also served his country with great distinction. He served in the U.S. Army for 20 years, including two tours in Vietnam, flying attack helicopters. During his extraordinary years of service, Mike was awarded with, among others, the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star, and the Meritorious Service Medal.  Our community is in debt to Mike for his continued public service since 1988. I wish him and his family all the best in retirement. His service will be truly missed by the folks in Southwest Michigan.                          ____________________
