It was facing some severe cutbacks in service without this funding.  In particular, the FAA had reduced funding for proficiency and developmental training of air traffic controllers. This funding was reduced by about $10 million without reprogramming approval from the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee. It is my hope and desire that the FAA add back at least $2 Million to the Air Traffic Instructional Services program. This is a vital program that should never have been cut back. It provides ongoing in-service developmental training all across the country. It has proven to lower error rates by air traffic controllers, thus making the skies safer for the flying public. I believe they should restore the funding immediately.
