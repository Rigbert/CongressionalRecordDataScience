 President, I rise today to introduce a Resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that the United States should declare its support for the right of the people of Kosova to determine their political future, once Kosova has made requisite progress, as defined by United Nations benchmarks, in developing democratic institutions and human rights protections.  In order to put my Resolution into the proper context, I would like briefly to discuss current conditions in the successor states of the former Yugoslavia, an area which has consumed a great deal of my attention for the last decade.  Much progress has been made in this former region of conflict since the fall of Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic in 2001 and the subsequent final dissolution of the Yugoslav federation. Slovenia has been invited to join NATO, and last week this body unanimously ratified the accession to NATO of Slovenia and six other candidate countries. Slovenia has also been invited to join the European Union next year.  Two other Yugoslav successor states--Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--have joined Albania in signing the U.S.-Adriatic Charter to cooperatively advance their candidacies for NATO membership. Both Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia have also signed EU Stabilization and Association agreements.  In Macedonia, although tensions that threatened full-scale conflict just two years ago remain, the newly elected coalition government is working to implement fully the Ohrid Framework Agreement of 2001, and the European Union assumed command of peacekeeping operations from NATO on March 31, 2003.  SFOR, the NATO-led international force, continues to maintain stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina in significantly smaller numbers than its original contingent. There is serious discussion about turning over command of the operation to the European Union, a move about which I have some reservations. The European Union Police Mission assumed international police monitoring duties in Bosnia and Herzegovina from the UN on January 1, 2003. The High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Paddy Ashdown, continues to oversee reform efforts and has the rightly placed special emphasis on strengthening the rule of law.  Serbia and Montenegro, under pressure from the EU, agreed to a constitutional charter that would keep them loosely united for the next three years, formally ending the entity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and setting them on a long-term path toward EU membership. Nonetheless, last week Filip Vujanovic, an advocate of Montenegrin independence, won a sweeping victory in the presidential elections. The runner-up candidate also advocated independence, as does Montenegro's prime minister Milo Djukanovic.  Despite this considerable progress, as a distinguished task force assembled by the Council on Foreign Relations noted in its ``Balkans 2010'' report of December 2002, the goal of regional stability and the promises of democratic transition are not yet fulfilled.  ``There is still a risk of backsliding in the region: the security situation in Macedonia remains tenuous; the coalition government in Serbia is irretrievably splintered; and in Kosovo all the political parties are organized around ethnic objectives and pander to nationalist sentiment. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, meanwhile, the elections in October 2002--which resulted in presidential victories for the three main nationalist parties at the expense of their moderate competitors--demonstrated that nationalist feelings remain potent. One reason for these trends is the increasing discontent of local populations whose embrace of the West has failed to bring immediate improvements in their standard of living. . . Irredentist, criminal and anti-democratic forces will try to exploit people's frustration brought on by the difficulties inherent in transitions.''  Following the tragic assassination of Prime Minister Zoran Djindic on March 12, 2003, the government of Serbia launched a major crackdown on criminal elements and initiated much-needed defense reforms to enhance civilian control over the military. Serbian officials took an important and overdue step by handing over to UN representative in Kosova the remains of 37 ethnic Albanians believed to have been killed during Milosevic's 1998-1999 campaign.  Serbia must continue to step up its cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, ICTY. The single most significant move the Serbian government could make to prove its commitment to joining the West is to arrest former Bosnian Serb General Ratko Mladic and send him to The Hague. But there are other important measures, such as opening archives and turning over requested documents to the prosecution, that Serbia must take in order to meet its international obligations.  Now, I would like to turn to Kosova, the subject of my resolution. Since the end of hostilities four years ago, the peace has been kept by KFOR, an international peacekeeping force in which United States forces play a kept role and have responsibility for the southeastern sector of the province.  Last year for the first time since the 1999 conflict, refugee returns outnumbered departures, with around 2,700 refugees returning to the province. UN officials predict that the numbers will increase in 2003, and the United States has committed more than $14 million this fiscal year to that end. The Housing and Property Directorate has resolved nearly 2,000 property claims to date and estimates that it will have resolved 9,000 cases by the end of 2003--about one-third of all claims filed.  The Kosovo Protection Corps, the local gendarmerie, is gradually becoming more representative of the ethics diversity in Kosova and more skillful in its policing operations. Crime, and particularly inter-ethnic crime, has been significant reduced, and murders decreased in 2002 by 50 percent over the previous year. The province held elections three times in the past three years, twice for municipal seats and once to select assembly representatives, and in each case OSCE monitors deemed the elections generally free and fair.  Yet much remains to be done. The refugee returns of last year represent only a small fraction of the approximately 237,000 Kosova refugees currently in Serbia, Macedonia, and Albania. Moreover, there are 22,500 internally displaced persons within Kosova who, for various reasons, including loss of property, economic shortage, and fear of retribution or persecution, have been unable or unwilling to return to their homes. Many who have returned also fear for their security, are unable to secure employment, and have little or no access to social and economic opportunities. Formal unemployment hovers around 50 percent. Without the ability to sustain themselves and provide for their families, many young Kosovars have turned to criminal activity. And Kosova continues to provide a haven for traffickers and other criminals active throughout the Balkans.  The head of the UN administration, UNMIK, an experienced German diplomat named Michael Steiner, has established ``benchmarks'' to focus the agenda of Kosova's elected officials pursuant to fulfilling the mandate of UN Security Council Resolution 1244 for progress toward self-administration. These benchmarks include: the existence of effective, representative, and functioning institutions; the enforcement of the rule of law; freedom of movement; respect for the right of all Kosovars to remain and return; the development of a sound basis for a market economy; clarity of property title; normalized dialogue with Belgrade; and reduction and transformation of the Kosovo Protection Corps in line with its mandate.  The UN policy of ``standards before status'' is conceptually sound. Of course, real progress requires resources, and, unfortunately, the international community has not met all of its pledge commitments, and private investment until now has been sparse.  Some argue that foreign capital is hesitant to invest in Kosova as long as its future political status remains undefined. This line, however, confuses cause and effect. The reason that Kosova's final status remains in limbo is because conditions on the ground there do not yet allow the international community to allow a final status to be chosen.  To be sure, there have been serious attempts to move the process along. Mr. Steiner has initiated a dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade on technical issues and has begun the process of devolving many responsibilities onto Kosova's elected Assembly.  Sad to say, both ethnic Albanians and Serbs have undercut these efforts by focusing on final status, rather than on practical progress. Ethnic Albanian representatives in the Kosova Assembly have twice tried to pass a resolution calling for independence but were dissuaded by officials from the UN and the international community who rightly fear that such a move would only increase tensions in the region. Kosovar President Ibrahim Rugova has publicly ruled out any dialogue with Belgrade officials on future status.  The Serbs for their part, have been equally obdurate. Earlier this year, leading Serbian officials made aggressive statements regarding Kosova, including calling on the international community to take up the final status issue and demanding that Serb army forces be allowed to return there. I scarcely need comment that the latter demand is a total non-starter.  The UN Secretary General's report of April 14, 2003, noted that Belgrade continues to support parallel administrative structures in virtually all of municipalities that have a considerable Serb population in direct violation of UN Security Council 1244. Following a meeting with Kosovar Serb leaders on April 16, 2003, Serbian Prime Minister Zivkovic and Deputy Prime Minister Covic issued a statement calling the UN plan to devolve considerable powers to the democratically elected officials in Kosova ``unacceptable,'' and the government in Belgrade is reportedly setting up a Serbian state council to deal with administrative issues in the ethnic Serb communities in Kosova.  So what should we do? there are some who believe we should throw in the towel and declare support for one side or the other. I believe that those who would call for the United States to support either independence for Kosova, or reintegration of Kosova with Serbia, are prescribing a cure worse that the disease, however noble their intentions.  When in doubt it is always wise to fall back upon basic principles. In this case, the basic principle of democracy is self-determination. And self-determination can best be expressed through a referendum, but only after the local Kosova authorities, with the help of the international community, fulfill the United Nations benchmarks.  Let me be perfectly clear about the practical side of the issue. The demographics of Kosova, and the pro-independence stand of all the ethnic Albanian political leaders and parties there, make a future vote for independence nearly inevitable. If that is the will of the people of Kosova when conditions warrant their making a choice, then I will wholeheartedly support it.  But no rationale of catering to immediate economic expediency outweighs the damage a unilateral declaration of independence, or Congressional support thereof, would do to the international regime in Kosova--especially to the credibility of the United Nations Mission there--or to the promising, but fragile crackdown on criminal elements by the new Zivkovic government in Serbia.  The stakes of Balkan stability are simple too high to put the cart before the horse.  In order to meet the UN benchmarks, the leaders of Kosova from all ethnic communities must accelerate the process of building a fully functioning democracy that respects human rights and the rule of law. Agreeing to a process for settling the status issue will give them the political incentive and procedural basis to do so.  The Sense of the Senate resolution I have proposed recognizes the danger that an unnecessary delay in resolution of Kosova's final status would pose. But it also recognizes that theprecondition for resolving the final status issue through self-determination is a democratic government in Kosova in which human rights, including the rights of religious and ethnic minorities, are respected.  Therefore, the Resolution calls for holding a referendum on final status, once requisite progress has been made toward meeting the UN benchmarks, endorses continued cooperation with other international organizations, and supports continued U.S. economic assistance to encourage further development.  Rebuilding a society shattered by a vicious war is a frustrating, time-consuming effort. There is an undeniable temptation to heed the siren song of a declaration of independence. But short-term gratification usually leads to more severe long-term problems, and the case of Kosova is no exception. The international cooperative efforts of KFOR, the UN, the OSCE, and various other governmental and non-governmental bodies are making slow but steady progress. We should continue down this path, which is precisely what my Resolution advocates.  I hope other members will join me in supporting the people of Kosova in their efforts, through concrete political and social progress, to advance a decision on their final political status.                          ____________________
