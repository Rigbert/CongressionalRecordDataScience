Mr. Speaker, the European Roma Rights Center, ERRC, and Greek Helsinki Monitor, GHM, have just published a report on the human rights situation of Roma in Greece. ``Cleaning Operations: Excluding Roma in Greece'' documents the plight of the inhabitants of the Romani settlement of Aspropyrgos, outside Athens, and details the problems of Roma across the country. Illustrated with stark scenes of bulldozed homes and marginalized and neglected Romani communities, a picture disturbing in more ways than one has been painted.  In particular, the report supports the accusation that the Government of Greece has used preparations for the 2004 Olympics as justification for the campaign to uproot Roma. Ironically, Greece currently holds the presidency of the European Union.  The Helsinki Commission, which I cochair, held hearings in 1998, 2000, and in 2002 focused on the human rights problems faced by Roma with the intent of raising the awareness of these problems amongst the governments of the OSCE participating States. The plight of the Roma has also been addressed in specifichearings or briefings covering Greece, Russia, Serbia, Kosovo, and Romania, as well as the OSCE process.  Members of the Commission have also sent several letters to Greek leaders in recent years addressing longstanding human rights concerns in the Hellenic Republic, including those affecting the Romani community. These expressions of concern have specifically addressed forced evacuations of Roma from numerous villages, the abusive application of the use of national identity cards issued to Roma, the inability of Roma children to have access to schools on a nondiscriminatory basis and other matters of blatant racial discrimination.  This newly released report on Roma clearly indicates that the Greek Government has failed to properly address many of these ongoing concerns. At a June 2002 Commission hearing on Greece, in fact, I raised the specter of an intensified campaign targeting Roma to obtain land for use as venues for the 2004 Olympics. This campaign is well documented in this report.  Notwithstanding the assertions of Greek officials at the Commission hearing that ``everything is done (concerning the relocation) in consultation with, and with the consent of, the Roma involved,'' numerous non-governmental organizations have raised such issues with Athens. Greek human rights activists have stepped forward.  As an original signatory to the 1975 Helsinki Final Act, Greece has accepted numerous commitments pertaining to the treatment of Roma and joined in condemning discrimination against Roma, a provision found in the 1999 Istanbul OSCE Summit Document. Regrettably, the Greek Government has failed to fulfill these commitments, as documented in the new ERRC/GHM report on Roma in Greece.  The ERRC and GHM conducted intensive field missions that revealed several patterns of human rights abuse against Roma in Greece: cruel and inhuman or degrading treatment of Roma in housing; police violence against Roma; exclusion of Roma from the educational system; and, barriers to access to health care and other social support services for Roma.  Based on the facts in this report and the discussions I have had over the years in my leadership capacity with the Helsinki Commission, I urge the Government of Greece to take corrective measures, without delay, along the lines recommended by the ERRC and the GHM:  1. Facilitate access to Greek citizenship for those Roma residing in Greece who are stateless and provide the necessary legal documents, such as identity cards, to all Roma.  2. Use all appropriate means to guarantee protection against forced evictions outside the rule of law and without due process.  3. Bring to justice public officials and private individuals responsible for forced evictions of Roma in breach of Greek law.  4. Carry out thorough and timely investigations into all alleged instances of police abuse.  5. Undertake effective measures to ensure that local authorities register all persons factually residing in a given municipality, without regard to ethnicity.  6. Ensure that Romani schoolchildren have equal access to education in a desegregated school environment.  7. Without delay, adopt comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation, as called for in the 1999 OSCE Istanbul Summit Document.  8. Conduct public information campaigns on human rights and remedies available to victims of human rights abuse, and distribute in both the Greek and Romani languages.  9. Conduct comprehensive human rights and anti-racism training for national and local administrators, members of the police force, and the judiciary.  10. At the highest levels, speak out against racial discrimination against Roma and others, and make clear that racism will not be tolerated.  The Helsinki Commission will continue to monitor the situation of Roma in the Hellenic Republic with the aim of encouraging the Government of Greece to implement commitments it has agreed to within the framework of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The Commission will also work to ensure that the plight of Roma in Greece is raised at the Human Dimension Implementation Meeting to be held this Fall in Warsaw.                          ____________________
