Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriation bill and therefore violates clause 2 of rule XXI.  The rule states in pertinent part: ``An amendment to a general appropriation bill shall not be in order if changing existing law.'' The amendment gives affirmative direction in effect.  I ask for a ruling from the Chair.  The Acting CHAIR. Does any Member wish to address the point of order?  The gentleman from Michigan is recognized.
