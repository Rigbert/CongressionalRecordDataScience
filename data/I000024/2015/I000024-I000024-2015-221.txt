President, just Wednesday of this week, the new annual Gallup poll came out. It said very clearly that among the six environmental concerns the Gallup poll included in its survey, global warming polled at the very bottom, right after the loss of the tropical rainforests, I might add. Gallup also found that a majority believe that the seriousness of global warming is overstated.  The Obama administration and others on this side like to claim 97 percent of the world's scientists believe in manmade global warming. Monday's Wall Street Journal op-ed debunked the 97 percent and the survey represents the views of only 79 respondents out of 3,149. Lastly, the agencies they are talking about that claim that 2014 was the warmest year on record, such as NASA--NASA now has reduced that to 38 percent. They have retreated from that position. So the people have caught on to this hysteria, and I ask colleagues to oppose the amendment.
