Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3222 and thank Chairman Murtha and Ranking Member Young for the fine bill they have crafted. I would particularly like to highlight one item that is not in the bill. It's funding for the Administration's proposal to build a new nuclear weapon, the so called Reliable Replacement Warhead. The Administration proposed funding in the Energy and Water Appropriations measure for the warhead. They also asked for $30 million for design and development of the warhead in H.R. 3222.  In conjunction with my Ranking Member, Mr. Hobson, we did not provide funds for this proposal in the Energy and Water Bill. I thank Chairman Murtha and Mr. Young for their foresight and correct policy decision in also eliminating funding for this program in H.R. 3222.  Profound decisions on the use of nuclear weapons stockpile need to be made--this is a serious and fundamental responsibility. Plans need to be articulated with specificity before this Nation should consider proceeding with the President's call for a new nuclear weapon.  First, there is a need for a comprehensive nuclear defense strategy and stockpile plan to guide transformation and downsizing of the stockpile and nuclear weapons complex--and until progress is made on this critical issue, there will be no new facilities or Reliable Replacement Warhead. Only when a future nuclear weapons strategy is established can the Departments of Defense and Energy determine the requirements for the future nuclear weapons stockpile and nuclear weapons complex plan. To date no Administration has developed and articulated a policy that takes into account the changes in our world situation since the end of the Cold War, the advent of regional conflicts such as we've seen in Kosovo and the terrorist attacks of 9/11.  Further, testimony before the subcommittee has pointed to the potential for the international community to misunderstand development of a new nuclear weapon by the United States. Moreover, for the last decade, the Administration has said that Stockpile Stewardship was the path to maintain the safety, security and reliability of the nuclear stockpile. Now, with three major stockpile stewardship facilities all over budget, over their deadlines, and not completed, we are told, ``Let's do something else.''  Given the serious international and domestic consequences of the U.S. initiating a new nuclear weapons production activity, it is critical that the administration lay out a comprehensive course of action before funding is appropriated. Major transformation of the weapons complex can only be produced with significant bipartisan support, lasting over multiple sessions of Congress and multiple Administrations. I don't think it is asking too much for a comprehensive nuclear strategy before we build a new nuclear weapon.  The Administration has proposed funding to begin engineering and cost studies of a reliable replacement warhead. In this, they have got the cart well before the horse. No funds should be provided for this activity. Future funding should only be considered following the adoption of a new strategic weapons plan for the Nation whereby the President establishes the anticipated threat environment and the role of nuclear weapons in addressing the projected threats. The strategic weapons plan must then guide a new nuclear stockpile plan before it can be determined if and when a reliable replacement warhead is needed.  In closing, I again want to thank Chairman Murtha and Mr. Young for their wise and positive decision in this matter.  The Chairman. No general debate is in order. The bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5-minute rule.  No amendment to the bill may be offered except those specified in the previous order of the House of today, which is at the desk.
