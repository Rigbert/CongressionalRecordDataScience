Speaker, I yield myself 8 minutes.  Mr. Speaker, we consider today an issue that is perhaps the most fundamental issue that can come before the House: Who shall be elected representative of a congressional district. It is a decision that the Constitution of the United States places in the hands of two entities. First instance, the voters of our districts, the people, and then secondly, the Members of this House to judge whether that election was conducted properly.  It is, therefore, a matter of great importance that should be approached with caution, serious consideration, thorough and fair analysis, and nonpartisanship. It is with regret, frankly, that I stand before my colleagues today to say that while I believe the decision the majority is recommending is correct and appropriate, the process that preceded that decision is not one I hope that future Congresses will replicate.  The procedures set forth in the Federal Contested Election Act, under which this contested election was supposed to be considered, are quite clear and have been used under Democratic and Republican majorities. The procedures that the task force and the committee undertook in this election contest were not consistent with the act, in my opinion, and were not fair, and were certainly not bipartisan.  From the beginning of this contest, I repeatedly sought a bipartisan process whereby we could agree on the procedures and the issues before us. I was disappointed that throughout the last 14 months, those efforts were continually and consistently rebuffed. So closed has this process been that as I stand before my colleagues today, I have only just received a copy of the majority's report. In fact, contrary to assertions and commitments that were made to me, I have never been given the majority's analysis of the votes in question to this very day. I, nor any other Member on this floor, with the possible exception of the two Republican task force members and the gentleman from California (Mr. Thomas), have seen the analysis on which the numbers that we have heard earlier today are based.  It is incomprehensible to me that I come to the well of this House with absolutely no idea how the majority reached its findings. Although I am a full member of the task force, I have yet to see the list of names behind the numbers on the majority's report. I have agreed to keep that confidential, and I appreciate the chairman's observation that in fact every name has been kept confidential.  However, because the minority, after a fight, had access to the data received from the Immigration and Naturalization Service, I can make some judgments about the majority's numbers.  My colleagues cannot read this chart, I understand, any better than we could read the majority's chart. Why? Because as the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Ehlers) said, it has been a complicated process. But I point out to my colleagues only that the minority staff, smaller and with less information, did, in fact, analyze and go through all of the votes and all of the names that were generated during the course of this investigation.  The minority staff on the Committee on House Oversight undertook an extensive and exhaustive analysis of the data from the INS and other sources. The minority undertook a diligent and exhaustive review of the records before us.  An enormous database was developed which included information on Orange County registrants who potentially matched an INS individual, all naturalization data about the individual that was available, including electronic and hand written notations, and all relevant information about the individuals registration date and voting status. First, the minority had to reduce the massive list to those who actually voted in the 46th Congressional District, from this database we were able to discern individuals who had gender conflicts, obvious first name mismatches, obvious middle name mismatches, and individuals who were clearly American citizens by virtue of birth, parentage or naturalization date.  The INS repeatedly warned that their data could not be relied on for the purpose it was being used. Short of face-to-face interviews, we will never know for sure that the individual from the INS is indeed the same individual as the Orange County voter. Yet, given that caveat, some conclusions about the majority's number can be stated.  I can tell my colleagues that the number of voters who are described as illegal, noncitizen voters is greatly exaggerated, and that the majority's own evidence shows this. I want to show my colleagues a chart where we have analyzed some, not all, about 150, of the 346 or so that may be voters who are not identified by naturalization date. The fact of the matter is that we have found that 93 percent of the signature matches on suspect lists referenced by the, 93 percent, were in fact U.S. citizens on November 5, 1996.  I can tell my colleagues that rather than stonewalling and being uncooperative, the INS responded to more than 20 separate committee requests for either electronic data matches or paper file reviews. The INS has provided approximately 8,000 worksheets and nearly 3,700 signatures for the committee. I would tangentially inform everybody in this House, as I have before: This process has never been pursued before in the history of this Republic; not when the Irish immigrants moved into Boston, not when the Italian immigrants moved into Providence; not when the Polish immigrants moved into Chicago; not when the Jewish population moved into New York; never before in the history of America. Not once has this process been pursued.  Mr. Speaker, 72 different INS field offices, including five INS foreign offices, as well as district offices, sub-offices, service centers, asylum offices and headquarters assisted the committee inthis investigation. I can tell my colleagues that within 7 days of being subpoenaed by the Committee on House oversight, the INS provided the committee with its first list of names, over 500,000 from around the country. There were less than 110,000 people who voted in the congressional race in the 46th District, yet 500,000 names were generated by the INS in response to the majority's request.  I can also tell my colleagues that of the 748 votes that the majority contends are illegal votes by noncitizens, 124 of them concern absentee ballots. The registrar of elections who did an outstanding job during the course of the election and during the course of this investigation, Roz Lever, said that in a less contested election, she would count. Why? Because the only thing wrong with that citizens' vote was that it was delivered by the wrong person under the statute. It was an absentee ballot. It may have been a neighbor rather than a husband that was able to deliver that ballot, but they were citizens of the United States of America. Their citizenship was never in doubt. Although the majority talks about 748 noncitizens voting, they know that number is exaggerated.  Furthermore, I can tell my colleagues that beyond these absentee ballots, hundreds, hear me now, hundreds of the so-called illegal, noncitizen voters are indeed citizens, and have been for a very long time. While some may not have been citizens when they registered, a bone of legal contention, and I understand that, they were citizens when they voted. The massive net that the majority cast over the past 14 months included individuals that had been citizens prior to 1996, and hear me now, have been citizens of this country for over 20 years that are in the list that the majority has projected.  Let me make clear, at no time was there any credible evidence to show anything other than the election of Loretta Sanchez. When Robert Dornan's initial allegations proved groundless, that should have been the end of this matter. But the majority wanted to prove a point. They wanted, for the first time ever to move the Federal contested elections act beyond a motion to dismiss. When even that effort proved fruitless, they turned to the INS.  This matter has taken longer than it should have, Mr. Speaker. The committee has had in its possession the evidence that it needed to reach today's conclusion for at least 5 months.  If the committee's initial request to the INS had been more focused, rather than the 500,000 person fishing expedition it was, we could have finished sooner. If the majority had managed the procedures of this case in a thoughtful and expeditious manner, rather than letting motions objecting to Mr. Dornan's overly broad and intrusive sit for months, we could have finished earlier. If we could have come together and reviewed the evidence together, rather than duplicating staff and committee resources, we could have come to this House sooner.  Some people on this floor continue to talk about fraud. The district attorney had an extensive investigation. Allegations were made on this floor about individuals and about organizations.                              {time}  1145  The grand jury of California refused to indict a single person or single organization after hearing the evidence. As I said earlier, at no time was the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Sanchez) ever, ever implicated in any wrongdoing. It is right and proper that we sustain her election today.  The facts have told a different story than were originally projected. After a yearlong investigation by the DA no crimes have been found. The DA of Orange County could not convince a grand jury of 19 citizens to indict anyone. The gentlewoman from California has been found, as we knew it to be the case, to have won this election. Mr. Speaker, I am glad this has finally come to an end.  Mr. Speaker, I would simply say that I will offer a motion to recommit so that the only thing in the resolutions is to do what we should have done in February of last year: Dismiss this complaint that did not provide credible evidence, as required by precedents for the last 30 years, to show anything other than the gentlewoman from California won cleanly, fairly, and obviously the election in the 46th Congressional District in 1996.
