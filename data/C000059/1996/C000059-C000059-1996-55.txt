Speaker, a strong domestic oil and gas industry not only means more jobs and a better economic future, but is essential for our Nation's national security.  Throughout the last decade America's oil and gas industry has lost a staggering number of jobs to sunnier business climates.  My Energy and Mineral Resources Subcommittee has been conducting hearings to highlight the need for a Federal energy policy that encourages domestic exploration and production.  This policy must allow our oil and gas producers to have greater public land access while reducing the regulatory burden on doing business at home.  I have no doubt that this Congress will reverse recent trends and move toward a policy that encourages exploration and production to ensure a vibrant healthy economy.                          ____________________
