This amendment simply strikes a requirement that the GAO report to the House Administration Committee regarding its work on the Architect of the Capitol. We have been informed the committee does not have oversight for the Architect and therefore have been requested to delete this reference. I have consulted with my colleague and the ranking member, Senator Bennett, and I ask unanimous consent this technical correction be agreed to.
