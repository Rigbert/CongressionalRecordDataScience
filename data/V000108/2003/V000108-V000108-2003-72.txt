Speaker, it is with great pride and respect that I wish to commend Army Reserve Specialist Roy Russell Buckley for his bravery in the field of battle and his willingness to fight for his country. Specialist Buckley lost his life on Wednesday, April 23, 2003 in Baghdad, Iraq while transporting fuel trucks for the 685th TransportationCompany, part of the United States Army's 3rd Infantry Division. His sacrifice will be remembered at funeral services on Saturday, May 3, 2003 by a community that has been struck hard by the devastating loss of one of its own.  A native of Merrillville, IN, Specialist Buckley graduated from Merrillville High School in 1996. He was a gifted athlete, with an orange belt in karate and possessed the strength to lift over 950 pounds. After graduating from high school, Specialist Buckley decided to join the Army Reserves with the hope that it would assist him financially with college, help him learn a trade, and allow him to find himself through the discipline and order that it provides.  It came as no surprise to those who knew Specialist Buckley that he would serve his country. A true patriot, his love for his country was evident from the time that he was a child. He collected items with patriotic themes, and his bedroom remains adorned with symbols of his patriotism. A poster of the Declaration of Independence hangs above his bed, and an ``Army of One'' poster hangs by the door. He once hung an American flag next to a bright light in his bedroom because he wanted to see the flag glow, and now a flag serves as the curtain for his window. Specialist Buckley felt tremendous pride for his country, and he was willing to endanger his own life to-protect the lives of his fellow citizens. His courage and heroism will always be remembered, and his sacrifice will forever live in the hearts and minds of those for whom he battled.  Mr. Speaker, Specialist Buckley, along with 160 other local reservists with the 685th Transportation Company, left for Fort Campbell, KY on January 24, 2003 after being called into active duty. His unit was deployed to Kuwait in February, and was instrumental in the battle to liberate the Iraqi people. Specialist Buckley was riding in a large fuel truck when an accident occurred and he was thrown from the vehicle. He gave his life so that the freedoms and values that he treasured could be enjoyed by those around the world.  Although he loved his unit and his country, Specialist Buckley treasured his family above all else. He is survived by his mother, Janie Espinoza, his stepfather, Phillip Espinoza, his four siblings, his fiance, Jenina Bellina, and his 6-year-old daughter, Alicia Faith Buckley. Jenina is stationed in Iraq with the same reservist unit for which her fiance gave his life. These individuals were the heroes to a man that we will forever call a hero, and we should honor them in this tumultuous moment as well.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring a fallen hero, U.S. Army Reserve Specialist Roy Russell Buckley. Specialist Buckley is the third resident of Northwest Indiana to sacrifice his life during Operation Iraqi Freedom, and his passing comes as a difficult setback to a community already shaken by the realities of war. Specialist Buckley will forever remain a hero in the eyes of his family, his community, and his country; thus, let us never forget the sacrifice he made to preserve the ideals of freedom and democracy.                          ____________________
