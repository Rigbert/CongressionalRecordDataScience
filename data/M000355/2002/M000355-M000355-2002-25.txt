 President, what is perhaps more amazing than Strom Thurmond's record length of service in the Senate is how he made it here in the first place.  Strom Thurmond was the first and only American ever elected to the Senate as a write-in candidate. The dizzying prospect of waging a write-in campaign strikes fear into any aspiring or incumbent politician. After all, getting voters to the polls is one thing. Getting voters to go the extra mile and write in a name not listed on the ballot is a wholly different beast.  So once one knows that in 1954, Strom was able to inspire a majority of South Carolina voters to write him into the Senate, and into the history books, it makes perfect sense why he also ended up as our Nation's longest serving Senator.  Today, of course, it is Strom's record-setting tenure that has captivated American political and popular culture. Turn the page of any magazine or the dial of any radio and, eventually, you will find Americans holding up Strom as the benchmark to near-immortality.  For years, Senator Thurmond has attributed his age-defying achievements to ``diet, exercise, and an optimistic attitude.'' Well, I dug a little deeper reading old clips on the advice he has given to friends and colleagues so I could try and piece together a more specific and exhaustive answer.  After sleuthing around a bit, here is the ``simple'' formula I can pass along: Begin your mornings with 20 minutes of calisthenics, 50 pushups, 10 minutes of weightlifting, and 20 minutes on a exercise bike. Oh, and swim a half mile twice a week; eat half of a banana, four prunes, a handful of grapes, blueberries, peaches, egg whites, a glass of Orange Juice, and a glass of prune juice; inherit good genes; abstain from fried or fatty foods. But eat lots of chicken, fish, and all kinds of seafood; abstain from caffeine; abstain from sugars; abstain from smoking.  But beneath all the rubble surrounding ``Strom's Secrets,'' one ingredient stands out above all others. In an editorial celebrating the Senator's 99th birthday, the Rock Hill Herald revealed Strom's secret to longevity as ``his determination to serve South Carolina as long as he's able.''  I believe that this sentiment more than the prune juice or the push-ups best explains Strom's record-setting service to South Carolina, from a small-town school superintendent among the peach groves of tiny Edgefield, SC, to almost a half a century in the Senate.  Mr. President, as I said, the year Senator Thurmond came to this body on a write-in--a most astonishing thing because no other Senator in American history has ever been elected to the Senate by a write-in--I was playing Little League baseball in Augusta, GA, across the Savannah River from Senator Thurmond's hometown of Aiken. I confess I was not following politics all that carefully at age 12, butI do remember my parents talking about Senator Thurmond's astonishing accomplishment right across the river in South Carolina, having been elected to the Senate on a write-in ballot.  As I grew older and began to pay attention to Government and politics in America, I began to realize Strom Thurmond was something quite special. When I came to the Senate in 1984, 40 years after my parents telling me about Senator Thurmond winning on a write-in, I knew instantly I was in the presence of a legend, as we all have been who have had the privilege of being a Member of this body at the same time as the senior Senator from South Carolina.  There will literally never be another American like Senator Thurmond. We all know he was too old for World War II, he did not have to go, but at age 42, as Senator Allen just made reference to, Senator Thurmond was there on D-day. In fact, he was in one of those gliders the night of D-day. Last year, we had an opportunity to see ``Band of Brothers'' on HBO about the 101st and its experience from D-day through the end of war. I watched every segment of that. In addition to what I was viewing on the television screen, I thought mostly about our colleague and his harrowing experience of going in the night of D-day on a glider. He did crack up, and as we all know, he was able to walk away and survive the crackup and survive the war and become an American hero.  Not many of us are ever going to be legends, and almost none of us are going to be legends in our own time. The Senator from South Carolina has lived long enough to observe his own legendary status, which is a truly remarkable thing. We will never, ever, see another Strom Thurmond. He is unique in the annals of American history.  I want to say to you, Senator Thurmond, as a son of the South myself, somebody who was born in Alabama and then migrated north to Kentucky--most people think of Kentucky as south, but for us it was north--and having lived in Georgia when you were first elected on a write-in, I want to say to you that you have been an inspiration to me and an inspiration to many of us in the deep South who have been so proud of you and your enormous accomplishments over the years.  I extend my congratulations to Senator Thurmond on his pending birthday, reaching 100 years of age. In fact, I had the Today show on this morning and Willard mentioned you, Senator Thurmond. He is working up to celebrating your 100th birthday in December and, of course, finishing up your term. You have had a truly remarkable career that will never be equaled in this body. My congratulations to you and our best wishes for the future.  So, Senator, today I raise my voice--joining the chorus of so many other voices--to pay my fondest farewell to your tireless and timeless dedication to serving the families of the great Palmetto State.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
