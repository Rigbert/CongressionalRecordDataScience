 President, I rise to warn the Senate of intensifying harassment against government whistleblowers. This trend threatens Congress'right to know, and preserves secrecy that shields bureaucratic misconduct. From the IRS to the State Department, retaliation is increasing against government employees who blow the whistle on wrongdoing by high government officials.  How did we get here? In the view of this Senator, one of the major problems has been the judicial activism of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, which has jurisdiction over challenges by government employees to illegal retaliatory acts, and which has grossly misinterpreted existing federal laws. To illustrate my concerns, I am enclosing for the Record a New York Times editorial; and a Federal Times article by the Government Accountability Project about the most extreme Federal Circuit precedent, involving Air Force whistleblower John White. This precedent could functionally cancel both the whistleblower law and the Code of Ethics.  I have no intention of passively acquiescing to the judicial equivalent of contempt of Congress.  The material follows:                 [From the New York Times, May 1, 1999]                    Helping Whistle-Blowers Survive       Jennifer Long, the Internal Revenue Service agent who      nearly lost her job two weeks ago after publicly blowing the      whistle on abuses at the agency, was rescued at the last      minute by the intervention of an influential United States      Senator. But the fact that her employers had no inhibitions      about harassing her is clear evidence that the laws      protecting whistle-blowers need to be strengthened. As they      stand, these laws merely invite the kind of retaliation that      Mrs. Long endured.       A career tax auditor, Mrs. Long was the star witness at      Senate Finance Committee hearings convened in 1997 by William      Roth of Delaware to investigate complaints against the IRS.      She was the only IRS witness who did not sit behind a curtain      and use a voice-distortion device to hide her identity. She      accused the agency of preying on weaker taxpayers and      ignoring cheating by those with the resources to fight back.      She has since said that she was subjected to petty      harassments from the moment she arrived back at her district      office in Houston. Then, on April 15 of this year, she was      given what amounted to a termination notice, at which point      Mr. Roth intervened with the IRS commissioner and saved her      job--at least for now.       Had he not intervened, Mrs. Long's only hope of vindication      would have been the remedies provided by the Civil Service      Reform Act of 1978 and the Whistle-Blower Protection Act of      1989. These two statutes prescribe a tortuous and uncertain      appeals process that in theory guarantees a whistle-blower      free speech without fear of retaliation, but in practice is      an exercise in frustration. Despite recent improvements, only      a handful of Federal employees, out of some 1,500 who      appealed in the last four years, have prevailed in rulings      issued by the Government's administrative tribunal, the Merit      System Protection Board. Overwhelmingly, the rest of the      cases were screened out on technical grounds or were settled      informally with token relief.       A few prominent whistle-blowers have won redemption outside      the system. Frederic Whitehurst, the chemist who was      dismissed after disclosing sloppiness and possible dishonesty      in the Federal Bureau of Investigation's crime laboratory,      won a sizable cash settlement because he had a first-class      attorney who mounted an artful public relations campaign.      Ernest Fitzgerald, the Pentagon employee who disclosed      massive cost overruns, survived because he was almost      inhumanly persistent and because his cause, like Mrs. Long's,      attracted allies in high places. But the prominence of an      issue does not guarantee survival for the employee who      discloses it. Notra Trulock, the senior intelligence official      at the Energy Department who tried to alert his superiors to      Chinese espionage at a Government weapons laboratory, has      since been demoted.       Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, has been      seeking ways to strengthen the 1989 law with the help of the      Government Accountability Project, a Washington advocacy      group that assists whistle-blowers. One obvious improvement      would be to give whistle-blowers the option to press their      claims in the Federal courts, where their cases could be      decided by a jury. To guard against clogging the system with      frivolous litigation, the cases would first be reviewed by a      nongovernment administrative panel. But the point is to give      whistle-blowers an avenue of appeal outside the closed loop      in which they are now trapped.       A reform bill along these lines passed the House in 1994      but died in the Senate. With Mrs. Long's case fresh in mind,      the time has come for both Houses to re-examine the issue.                                  ____                [From the Federal Times, July 26, 1999]            Court Turns Whistleblower Act Into Trojan Horse                            (By Tom Devine)       In a stunning act of extremism, the Federal Circuit Court      of Appeals has functionally thrown out two statutes      unanimously passed by Congress: the Code of Ethics for      Government Service and the Whistleblower Protection Act.       The decision, Lachance vs. White, reflects unabashed      judicial activism to overturn unanimous congressional      mandates.       The case involves an Air Force whistleblower, John White.       In 1992, he was moved and stripped of duties after      successfully challenging as gross mismanagement a local      command's Quality Education System, a bureaucratic turf      builder camouflaged as reform by micromanaging and imposing      de facto military accreditation on participating      universities.       Experts inside and outside the government agreed with      White.       The Air Force canceled the program after a scathing report      by its own experts found the program counterproductive for      education and efficiency.       Whistleblowing doesn't come any better than this.       The Merit Systems Protection Board three times ruled in      White's favor, each time challenged on technicalities by the      Office of Personnel Management.       But the appeals court decided it knew better.       The court concocted a hopelessly unrealistic standard for      whistleblowing disclosures to pass muster.       The court said a whistleblower must have had a ``reasonable      belief'' that he was revealing misconduct.       This ``reasonable belief'' is the prerequisite to be      eligible for reprisal protection, the court found.       At first glance, the court's definition of ``reasonable      belief'' is almost boringly innocuous: ``could a      disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts      reasonably conclude . . . gross mismanagement?''       But the devil is in the details. The court warmed up by      establishing a duty of loyalty to managers.       ``Policymakers have every right to expect loyal,      professional service from subordinates,'' the court said.       So much for the Code of Ethics, which is on the wall of      every federal agency since unanimous passage in 1980: ``Put      loyalty to the highest moral principles and to country above      loyalty to persons, party or government department.''       The court decreed that whistleblowing does not include      ``policy'' disputes.       But that's not what Congress said in 1994 amendments to the      whistleblower protection law: ``A protected disclosure may .      . . concern policy or individual misconduct.''                            a cruel illusion       Most surreal is the court's requirement for MSPB to conduct      an independent ``review'' to see if it was reasonable for the      employee to believe he revealed misconduct.       And whistleblowers must overcome the presumption that      government agencies act ``correctly, fairly, in good faith''      and legally unless there is ``irrefragable'' proof otherwise.       What's ``irrefragable''? My dictionary defines it as      ``[i]ncapable of being overthrown; incontestable, undeniable,      incontrovertible.''       This means if disagreement is possible, the whistleblower's      belief is unreasonable and eligibility for legal protection      vanishes.       Not content to render the Whistleblower Protection Act a      bad joke, the Court turned it into a Trojan Horse,      instructing the board to violate it routinely by searching      for evidence that the whistleblower has a conflict of      interest as part of its review.       Amendments to the whistleblower law in 1994 outlawed      retaliatory investigations--those taken because of protected      activity.       These developments are no surprise.       Before Chief Judge Robert Mayer's arrival on the court, he      served as deputy special counsel when his office tutored      managers and taught courses on how to fire whistleblowers      without getting caught.       Mayer's actions helped spark the Whistleblower Protection      Act's birth.       Now under his leadership, the Federal Circuit is killing it      with a sternly obsessive vengeance.       Under current law, there is no way out in the courts.       Except for unprecedented Supreme Court review, the Federal      Circuit Court of Appeals has a monopoly on judicial review of      whistleblower decisions by the MSPB. As long as it persists,      the Whistleblower Protection Act's promise will be a cruel      illusion.       Congress has a clear choice: passively institutionalize its      ignorance of executive branch misconduct, or restore its and      the public's right to know.       The solution is no mystery:       Pass a legislative definition of ``reasonable belief''      overturning all the nooks and crannies of this case.       Give federal workers the same access to the court that is a      private citizen's right--jury trials and an all-circuits      judicial review in appeals courts.       It is unrealistic for the government to expect federal      employees with second-class rights to provide first-class      service to the public.                          ____________________
