 Speaker, I would like to have printed in the Record statements by high school students from my home state of Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people today. I am asking that you please insert these statements in the Congressional Record as I believe that the views of these young people will benefit my colleagues.            Statement by David Hay Regarding VA Health Care       David Hay: For the record, my name is David Hay.       Congressman Sanders: Thank you very much for coming.       David Hay: I would like to talk about my dad. My dad is a      Vietnam veteran who is permanently and totally disabled due      to the war, and dying due to Agent Orange-related illnesses.      He is on medication for seizure disorder, depression,      physical pain, various forms of hepatitis and other diseases,      including emphysema.       Even with these medications, he is sometimes confined to      the house with pain and sickness. He gets about two to three      hours of sleep at night, and sometimes none at all. He spends      the first part of the morning vomiting and then takes his      medications, and endeavors not to vomit in order that the      medications may be effective.       My dad's average weight was 180 to 190 pounds. Now he is      lucky to reach 130 pounds. He has to force-feed himself. No      matter how much he eats, he still loses weight. He will gain      ten pounds one week and loss 15 the next. When he wakes up      from sleeping, he can hardly walk twenty feet from loss of      breath. My dad is not old, he just turned 52.       Part of the reason why he is so sick is because of the      medication he receives from the Veterans Association Hospital      in White River Junction. It is not rare at all for him to      receive the wrong medication, or a synthetic medication that      affects him badly, or a prescribed medication for him that      counteracts with other medications. They are constantly      changing his prescription. These medications affect with      malice his breathing, appetite, sleeping pattern, thoughts      and pain.       Just three weeks ago, I was at home reading the warning      label on one of his inhalers. It said not to take it with      seizure medication. My dad has to take seizure medications      every day, as with the inhalers. He has been using the      inhaler for over a year, and both were given to him by the      VA. And there are many other vets that this happens to.       I was wondering what you or Congress could do to correct      the carelessness of the Veterans Association Hospital, if      there could be laws or regulations that the doctors must look      into background of the patient and the current medication the      patient might be on before prescribing more drugs that could      harm or even kill the patient, and if there are such laws and      regulations, what can we do to enforce them.       Congressman Sanders: Thank you very much David.                                  ____Statement by Kayla Gildersleeve and Tess Gross Regarding Strengthening                           Pollution Standards       Kayla Gildersleeve: Our presentation is focused on a topic      that a lot of people have     never even heard of before, the CAFE standards, which stands      for the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards.       Tess Gross: The Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards      are also known as the CAFE standards. In the mid-'70s      Congress created the CAFE standards to regulate the amount of      gas used per mile by cars, and because they thought the U.S.      needed economic independence, less dependence on foreign oil,      and because they noticed the deterioration of the      environment.       Between 1973 and 1987, American cars increased their      average fuel efficiency from 14 miles per gallon to 28 miles      per gallon. Without the government's involvement, cars would      not have become so efficient so quickly.       Kayla Gildersleeve: Consumer Reports Magazine noted that      this trend is now being reversed. Vehicles made in 1998 have      the lowest average fuel efficiency for American cars in 16      years. According to the New York Times, 1996 was the first      year in which cars going into the junkyard got better mileage      than ones rolling off the dealers' lots.       There are several causes for this declining efficiency.      During the Reagan and Bush administrations, the Department of      Transportation allowed the standards to be rolled back, and      the preferences of American car buyers have changed. Over 30      percent of new vehicles are trucks, sport utility vehicles      and other four-wheel drive vehicles. These very inefficient      vehicles are used by most of their owners as passenger cars,      yet the government doesn't require them to meet the same fuel      economy standards that the cars must meet.       Most truck owners are more likely to use their trucks to      travel to the Grand Union than to a construction site. The      government should recognize this fact and increase the      requirements for sport utility vehicles.       Tess Gross: America needs to make more efforts to consume      less of the world's resources. Americans make up 5 percent of      the world's population, but use 26 percent of the world's      oil. Some Americans wish to provide more oil for the nation      by drilling Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. This      action would have a huge environmental impact, but would only      provide one-tenth of the oil that would be saved by raising      auto efficiency to an average of 40 miles per gallon.       Since cars increased their mile-per-gallon performance      nearly 100 percent between 1973 and 1988, big, gas-guzzling      autos and sport utility vehicles are now reversing this      process. Sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks      are subject to much less stringent requirements than cars.       In conclusion, we believe that, in order to help fix the      environment, increase economic independence, lessen the      United States' dependency on foreign oil, and to save      millions of dollars from importing oil, we would need to see      a great improvement in the CAFE standards.       Kayla Gildersleeve: In 1991 hundreds of thousands of      soldiers went to the Persian Gulf to fight in a war that was      fought for a variety of reasons, but primarily to protect the      America's oil supply. This example alone should be enough to      convince Americans that we should be consuming less oil.       Many changes will have to occur in American society to      dramatically reduce America's consumption of oil. One of the      simplest and quickest changes that we can make is for      Congress to raise fuel economy requirement for new passenger      vehicles, and all the vehicles that are used primarily for      transporting people, including sport utility vehicles.       There are many benefits: A cleaner environment, reduced      emissions of greenhouse gases, and less potential for being      drawn into a military conflict to protect our foreign oil      supply.       Congressman Sanders: Thank you very much.                                  ____ Statement by Nicholas Webb, Ginger Irish and Palmer Legare Regarding                      Safety Issues for Gay Students       Nicholas Webb: Last night, my mother said, ``You know,      Nick, I would never have chosen to have a gay son, but of all      the people in the world, I would still have chosen you.'' The      truth of the matter is, you can't pick your children.       And with that thought, I ask you, if your child, best      friend, or someone close to you were gay, could they be      honest with you? Too often, the answer is no. That is why the      Gay-Straight Alliance at CVU was started, to provide people      of all sexualities a safe avenue of support.       One in ten people are gay, and 30 percent of them are      suicidal. And even my own parents don't fully understand      homosexuality, but the important thing is that they accept it      and they support me.       If you answered no to the previous questions, then I tell      you with all factuality that you are endangering lives, quite      possibly the lives of your children and loved ones.       Too often have people come to me and ask me if they should      tell their parents that they are gay. Too often have I      witnessed 15-year-old kids getting kicked out of their house      simply because of their sexuality. If they even questioned      talking about such an important issue to their own family,      how can you expect them to live and trust their family?       We, the leaders of gay-straight alliances across the state,      are helping to make schools safer for homosexual, bisexual      and transgender students. But it is up to you, the society,      to make your own homes and communities safe. It could be your      child or your child's best friend who realizes how unfriendly      and condemning this country, this state is to homosexuals. It      could be them that decide it is not worth it to live in such      a place.       Understand that, whether you believe in homosexuality or      not, it's there, and you got to accept it. It's time for      people to, once again, rise above another form of racism, the      discrimination of sexual preference.       Finally, I ask you, each and every one of you, that if you      think you know someone who is gay, or if you think that your      child just might not be heterosexual, why can't they tell you      and why aren't you helping them? Because only inadvertently      do we actually hurt the ones we love.       Ginger Irish: Because of the reasons Nick has outlined,      straight members of the CVU community have reached out to      support GLVTU and to make our school a safer place for      everyone. In the past year, our GSA has spoken to health      classes, planned an AIDS awareness day, and has had various      speakers come to our school to discuss sexuality issues.       Some of the closed-mindedness of students at our school has      manifested itself in comments such as, ``Oh, are you in that      gay club?'' But, over the course of the past year, students      have learned to use gay-sensitive language, and have made      leaps and bounds in accepting homosexuality as an integral      part of our society.       As the leader and coordinator of the GSA next year, I plan      to continue educating the student body and faculty. Through      this education, and continual awareness, I hope to make CVU a      safe environment for all students questioning their      sexuality.       Accepting homosexuality within our community can open our      eyes to all differences among people, such as race,      disability or gender. The GSA will continue to make CVU a      melting pot for diversity among all its members.       Palmer Legare: First, I would like to say that I was      originally going to come here and make my own presentation,      but because there are so many gay-straight alliances here, a      lot of us had to combine, and leave out a lot of important      parts.       But I wanted to come and talk about the importance of a      public person like you going out and taking a public stand on      this issue, as opposed to simply making a policy and law,      which is also important. And I want to give an example of how      inefficient a good policy can be without much publicity.       In 1995, a law was passed in Vermont saying that all public      schools had to add sexual orientation to the anti-harassment      list by 1997. Well, a couple of years later, I and some other      people started looking into schools and what was going on.      And we found out that, actually, less than half of the      schools that were all supposed to have this, had it--less      than half.       We continued to look, and even the ones that did have the      anti-harassment policy didn't know how to enforce it.      Oftentimes, the teachers didn't know that the school had the      policy, and, often, the students didn't know that the school      had the policy.       Recently Governor Dean has taken a new strategy, and, last      week, he actually went to U32 and spoke publicly about the      importance of speaking out against homophobia, and we expect      that this is going to make a lot of change, and make a lot of      other schools realize that they need this policy. And we ask      that you also do something similar to that, maybe go to gay-     straight alliances and speak, and maybe go to a place like      Outright, which works with gay and lesbian teens.       Congressman Sanders: Thank you very much.                          ____________________
