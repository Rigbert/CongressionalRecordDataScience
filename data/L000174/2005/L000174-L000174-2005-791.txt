President, I am pleased to join my colleague from Texas, Senator John Cornyn, in introducing what is our second cooperative action in this Congress to improve the implementation of the Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA. This bill, called the ``Faster FOIA Act of 2005,'' responds to commonly voiced concerns of FOIA requestors over agency delay in processing requests.  I want to express my appreciation to all of the FOIA officers and other Federal employees who work hard to process FOIA requests quickly and efficiently. I know that many simple requests are filled within a few days, and I understand that complex requests dealing with national security issues can take time for declassification, redaction, or release, as appropriate.  There are, nonetheless, significant delays at many agencies. In 2003, a non-governmental organization, the National Security Archive, looked into just how long some FOIA requests are left unfulfilled. The group found that the oldest requests dated back to the late 1980s, before the collapse of the Soviet Union. The oldest of these was a request to the FBI for information on the Bureau's activities at the University of California. First filed in November 1987, this request was partially fulfilled in 1996 after extensive litigation. According to the National Security Archive, the documents that were released revealed ``unlawful FBI intelligence activities and the efforts to cover up such conduct.'' After a 2002 article in the San Francisco Chronicle, and inquiries from Senator Feinstein, the Bureau acknowledged that there were at least 17,000 pages of records that still had not been produced. Since then, some data has been released, but the requestor recently told me that he believes more than 15,000 pages remain outstanding.  This is an extreme case, but delays are commonplace. Sometimes slowdowns are caused by poorly managed or decentralized data systems that result in an agency not knowing what documents are located where. Other times, components within a single agency do not effectively communicate with one another, so that no one can say whether a request has been filled or not. Finally, we have heard anecdotal evidence of certain agencies engaging in protracted disputes over fee waivers sought by FOIA requestors. I have worked closely with the Government Accountability Office over the past few years to obtain detailed analysis of how fees are collected and how fee waiver requests are processed. The analysts at GAO have looked long and hard at these issues. I am grateful for their efforts and look forward to the results of their study later this year.  One of the problems faced by GAO, and anyone else who has looked into agency delay, is the lack of comprehensive reporting data. We address this problem in our companion bill, S.94, the Open Government Act, by calling for more detailed reporting from agencies on FOIA processing.  These issues deserve a closer look in the short term, however. In this bill, we propose to establish a commission to review agency delay and to make recommendations for reducing impediments to the efficient processing of requests. The Commission would also examine whether the system for charging fees and granting waivers should be modified.  The Commission would be made up of government and non-governmental representatives with a broad range of experience in both submitting and handling FOIA requests, in information science, and in the development of government information policy.  I understand that many requests are complex and that the resources devoted to agency FOIA processing are often lacking. Our companion bill, S. 394, the Open Government Act, addresses this issue by establishing a FOIA ombudsman requiring the Office of Personnel Management to examine how FOIA can be better implemented at the agency level. If the Commission finds that limited resources are a significant factor in slowing down the fulfillment of requests, then Congress should address the issue by increasing funding levels for FOIA processing.  I want to thank the Senator from Texas for his diligent work and flexibility in crafting a Commission structure that is balanced and fair, and that will bring extraordinary expertise to solving these nettlesome problems. I urge all of our colleagues to support the Faster FOIA Act, which has the potential to help agencies and requestors alike in the service of open government.                                 ______                                       By
