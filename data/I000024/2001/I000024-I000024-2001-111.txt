President, I rise today to introduce legislation thatwould create a new era in charitable giving across America. My bill, the Neighbor to Neighbor Act, includes provisions that would allow tax-free distribution of IRA accounts for charitable purposes, and give nonitemizers the same deduction that itemizers enjoy. It would also allow the deduction for charitable gifts of long-term capital gain property to be subject to an annual limit of 50 percent of adjusted gross income instead of the current 30 percent limitation. It would increase the carryover period for charitable deductions from five years to ten years; and it would exclude a charitable deduction from the three percent reduction rule. My bill would allow a taxpayer to deduct charitable contributions up until April 15th, and finally, the Neighbor to Neighbor Act would repeal the current two percent excise tax on private foundations.  My bill would greatly simplify one of the most complex provisions in the tax code. The tax code should reward the generosity of good-hearted Americans, it should not penalize those who choose to give to those in need.  IRA account owners would be permitted to make distributions from their IRAs directly to charities, either outright, or in exchange for a charitable gift annuity, a charitable reminder trust, or pooled income fund in the Neighbor to Neighbor Act. According to the Employer Benefit Research Institute, there are currently more than one trillion dollars in IRA accounts and five trillion dollars in defined contribution accounts, which can be rolled into IRA accounts.  I have numerous examples, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, from people who have wanted to donate their excess IRA assets to charity, but were unable to because of the current tax penalties For example, the ability to rollover an IRA to charity would mean literally millions of dollars for Boston College. Syracuse University lost a 1.5 million-dollar gift because the donor could not rollover his IRA into a charitable remainder trust.  A 71-year-old male donor with a 1.3 million IRA wanted to make a life income gift to a major public university in Texas. He wanted to receive annual income payments that would help ensure the care of his wife, who is in the early stages of Alzheimer's. Given the tax consequences of such a gift under current law, the donor has not been able to make the charitable contribution.  The husband of a hospital volunteer at a medical center in Tennessee would like to establish a charitable trust to benefit cancer research in honor of his last wife. He wants to use retirement plan assets of 1.8 million to establish this cancer research fund, to provide himself with annual payments for retirement income, and to reduce the tax burden on his heirs, would be greater for IRA assets than other appreciated securities. He has been advised against such a gift because of tax disincentives under current law.  These are just a few examples of how the current law levies significant taxes and presents serious disincentives to charitable gifts of these assets. Under current, law, any IRA withdrawal is fully taxable as ordinary income in the year in which it occurs. A donor who withdraws IRA assets in order to make a charitable gift is subject to tax on the entire amount withdrawn. Under very best of circumstances, this amount might be offset by a charitable deduction, but even then there are significant limitations.  My bill, which allows the tax-free distribution of individual IRA accounts for charitable purposes, is good public policy. Although IRA assets were originally intended as a supplement to retirement income, withdrawal is now allowed, under certain circumstances, to assist in financing a home or a college education. It is equally appropriate for public policy to allow financially successful individuals, who have reached a point where IRA and other tax-deferred retirement assets are not needed for retirement, to use those assets, not for personal benefit, but to support charities that better the lives of others.  The Neighbor to Neighbor Act would also allow donors who make charitable contributions, but do not itemize their federal income tax deductions, to be entitled to a ``direct'' charitable contribution deduction. Since three out of four taxpayers do not itemize, the charitable deduction is not available to most taxpayers. A report by Price Waterhouse Coopers estimates that the deduction for nonitemizers would translate into 11 million more donors, and could increase giving by as much as 14.6 billion dollars in one year.  The deduction also does not provide an equal treatment for all donors, and it encourages fundraising efforts to focus on a small group of potential donors. By expanding the charitable contribution deduction for nonitemizers, the playing field would be level for all donors, and would lessen the role of government and the political process in charitable giving.  People should not face disincentives that burden charitable giving. My bill would allow the deduction for gifts of long-term capital gain property to public charities to be subject to an annual limit of 50 percent of adjusted gross income instead of the current 30 percent limitation. In addition, the carryover period for charitable deductions that cannot be fully used in a given tax year, due to the applicable percentage limitation, would be increased from the current five year to 10 years.  The current percentage limitations on the deductibility of charitable contributions of long-term capital gain property to public charities, coupled with the reduction in the tax rates applicable to realized, long-term capital gains, are having a chilling effect on immediate charitable giving, the former reduces the incentive to make relatively large gifts of capital assets in the current year if the donor's contribution base is relatively small, compared to the value of the gift that could be made.  For example, just since last June, at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, four individuals have indicated an interest in giving amounts ranging from one to three million dollars. These individuals have not yet given because of the tax disincentives of the 30 percent rule; they can only deduct charitable contributions up to 30 percent of their adjusted gross income.  By increasing the income tax charitable deduction reduction percentage for contributions of long-term capital gain property to public charities from 30 percent to 50 percent of the donor's contribution base, gifts of highly-appreciated assets will be put on par with gifts of cash, and the tax law will again boost private philanthropy in America.  The Neighbor to Neighbor Act would also allow a taxpayer to deduct, for the current year, charitable contributions made up to the time for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return for that tax year. Currently, taxpayers may contribute to their IRAs up until April 15th and still receive a deduction. Charitable donations should have the same tax treatment.  Finally, this bill would repeal the excise tax imposed on the investment income of private foundations. Private foundations are section 501(c)(3) charities that fund the work of a full range of charitable activities across the country. They are often founded by individuals or families, and their income stream comes primarily, if not entirely, from earnings on their investments.  Repeal of the excise tax would have the effect of increasing charitable contributions by hundreds of millions of dollars every year. This is because private foundations are required, annually, to pay out five percent of their assets in charitable distributions, and since the excise tax counts as a credit toward the distribution requirement, repeal would require an increase in charitable distributions by an equal amount.  The excise tax was originally enacted in 1969 as an ``audit fee,'' intended to offset the cost of IRS oversight of private foundations. But today, the tax collects far more than the IRS needs to conduct audits. In 1999, the excise tax produced 500 million dollars in revenue. And this year, the budget of all exempt-organization activities at the IRS is only 59 million dollars. Moreover, audits of private foundations fell from 1,200 in 1990 to 191 in 1999. This ``audit fee'' is not being used for its intended purpose.  The wayward use of these revenues is a good reason to repeal the tax, but not as important as the work we increasingly call on charities to perform. With the focus of the President and the Congress on charitable giving, I believe passage of the Neighbor to Neighbor Act would be one of the most effective steps we could take.  If we hope that charities will join state and federal government efforts to provide services for disadvantaged people and otherwise address important societal needs, then Congress should enhance the tax incentives that encourage voluntary philanthropy. Private foundations, like public charities, are publicly supported to the extent that they receive tax preferences. The provisions of the Neighbor to Neighbor Act are reasonable, efficient steps that will help charities address our common challenges; challenges we increasingly call on individuals and the private sector to take.  In an article for The Journal of Gift Planning, President Bush stated, ``I believe that the government's highest calling is often simply to do no harm--to instead be an enabler, a catalyst that creates a climate that allows America's nonprofits to flourish. A government that serves those who are serving their brothers and sisters. A government that rallies the armies of compassion to heal our nation's ills, one heart and one act of kindness at a time.'' I believe that the Neighbor to Neighbor Act does just that, and I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
