President, I rise today to pay tribute to perhaps the best running back who ever carried a football, Walter Payton, who died yesterday at the age of 45. In Carl Sandburg's City of the Big Shoulders, ``Sweetness,'' as Payton was nicknamed, managed to carry the football hopes of an entire city on his shoulders for 13 magnificent years.  From the law firms on LaSalle to the meat packing plants on Fulton, Monday mornings in Chicago were always filled with tales of Payton's exploits on the field from the previous day. We marveled at his ability and reveled in the glory he brought to Chicago and Da Bears. In a life cut short by a rare disease, he blessed Chicago with several lifetimes of charisma, courage, and talent.  Who could forget the many times Payton lined up in the red zone and soared above opposing defenders for a Bears touchdown? Or the frequency with which his 5-10, 204-pound frame bowled over 250-pound linebackers en route to another 100-yard-plus rushing game? His relentless pursuit of that extra yard and the passion with which he sought it made his nickname, Sweetness, all the more ironic. It would take the rarest of diseases, barely pronounceable and unfortunately insurmountable, to finally bring Sweetness down.  It was that passion that inspired Payton's first position coach, Fred O'Connor, to declare: ``God must have taken a chisel and said, `I'm going to make me a halfback.' '' Coach Ditka called Payton simply ``the greatest football player I've ever seen.'' Payton's eight National Football League (NFL) records, most of which still stand today, merely underscore his peerless performance on the field and his extraordinary life away from it. The man who wore number 34 distinguished himself as the greatest performer in the 80-year history of a team that boasts more Hall of Famers than any other team in League history.  He played hurt many times throughout his career, and on one notable occasion, when he should have been hospitalized with a 102 degree fever, he played football. On that day, November 20, 1977, Payton turned in the greatest rushing performance in NFL history, rushing for a league record 275 yards en route to victory against the Minnesota Vikings.  Self-assured but never cocky, Sweetness had no interest in indulging the media by uttering the self-aggrandizing sound bites that are all too common among today's athletes. Instead, he would praise the blocking efforts of fullback Matt Suhey or his offensive linemen, all of whom were inextricably linked to the surfeit of records he amassed. He play the game with a rare humility--refusing to call attention to himself--always recognizing the individuals who paved the way for his achievements.  He once refused to be interviewed by former Ms. America Phyllis George unless his entire corps of linemen were included. Following his first 1,000 yard rushing season, Payton bought his offensive linemen engraved watches. The engraving, however, made no mention of the 1,390 yards he finished with that year, but instead noted the score of the game in which he reached 1,000 yards, underscoring the essential contributions that his offensive linemen made in enabling him to achieve this feat.  And how many times did we see Walter Payton dance down the field, a limp leg, a quick cut, a break-away. He could find daylight in a crowded elevator. And when a tackler finally brought him down, Walter Payton would jump to his feet and reach down to help his tackler up. That's the kind of football player he was. That's the kind of person he was.  Payton lightened the atmosphere at Hallas Hall with an often outlandish sense of humor, even during the years when the Bears received boos from the fans and scathing criticism from the press. Rookies in training camp were often greeted by firecrackers in their locker room and unsuspecting teammates often faced a series of pranks when they turned their backs on Payton. Just last week, as Payton was clinging to life, he sent Suhey on a trip to Hall of Famer Mike Singletary's house, but not before he gave Suhey a series of incorrect addresses and directed Suhey to hide a hamburger and a malt in Singletary's garage.  While Payton lived an unparalleled life on the football field, he also lived a very full life off the field. He was a brilliant businessman, but never too busy to devote countless hours to charitable deeds, most of which were unsolicited and voluntary. Sweetness shared with us a sense of humanity that will endure as long as his records. I had the good fortune on July 4th to meet his wife and children, who are equally fine people. The apple didn't fall too far from the tree. Jarrett Payton, like his father, decided to try out for football in his Junior Year. Jarrett was a standout at St. Viator High School in Arlington Heights, a Chicago suburb, and he is now playing football at the University of Miami. It looks as if he may have quite a career of his own.  In his last year, Walter Payton helped illuminate the plight of individuals who are afflicted with diseases that require organ transplants. Patients with the rare liver disease that Payton contracted, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), have a 90% chance of surviving more than one year if they receive a liver transplant. Unfortunately, the need for donations greatly exceeds the demand. The longer that patients wait on the organ donation list, the more likely it is that their health will deteriorate. In Payton's case, the risk of deadly complications, which included bile duct cancer, grew too quickly. Payton likely would have had to wait years for his life-saving liver. This was time he did not have before cancer took his life yesterday. A day when everyone who needs a life-saving organ can be treated with one cannot come soon enough.  More than 66,000 men, women, and children are currently awaiting the chance to prolong their lives by finding a matching donor. Minorities, who comprise approximately 25% of the population, represent over 40% of this organ transplant waiting list. Because of these alarming statistics, thirteen people die each day while waiting for a donated liver, heart, kidney, or other organ. Half of these deaths are people of color. The untimely death of Payton is a wake-up call for each of us to become organ donors and discuss our intentions with our families so that we do not lose another hero, or a son, a daughter, a mother or a father to a disease that can be overcome with an organ transplant.  Mr. President, today is a sad day in Chicago and in our nation. We have lost a father, a husband, a friend, and a role model all at once. While we are overcome with grief, we are also reminded of the blessings that Payton bestowed upon his wife, Corrine, his children, Jarrett and Brittney, and the city of Chicago during his brief time with us.  So thanks for the memories, Sweetness. Soldier Field will never be the same.                          ____________________
