Chairman, I rise to simply say that, in response to my friend from Ohio (Mr. Portman), the administration is on its toes, but I am sure it is glad to hear the views of the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Traficant) as well. I rise and will support this sense of the Congress.  Clearly, as the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Portman) has indicated, there are other criteria and there are other reasons why we move into this area or that area for assistance. However, I think the gentleman from Ohio raises a very good point and certainly his explanation earlier raised an issue of obvious concern, not only to him but to the country, in terms of making sure that those communities which have both high poverty rates and high unemployment rates should be a focus of Federal assistance so that we can bring up those areas so that they become equally successful to some other areas of the country, and I would share his view.  He said a billion and if, in fact, it was a community that can raise $2.5 billion, it would be certainly not a community that I represent but a community that has obviously a lot of ability to assist itself. I think in that context the gentleman's sense of Congress does, as the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Portman) said, make sense and I would support it.
