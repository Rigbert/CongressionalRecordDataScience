 On June 4, 2013, President Obama nominated Patricia Millett to be a United States Circuit Judge.  Patricia's qualifications to be a United States Circuit Judge are impeccable. She is a graduate of Harvard Law School and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Patricia practiced at Miller & Chevalier and worked as a law clerk for Judge Thomas Tang, on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Following 4 years in the appellate section of the Department of Justice's Civil Division, Patricia served as assistant to the Solicitor General for more than a decade.  After her public service, Patricia joined Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP, where she heads the firm's Supreme Court practice and is co-leader of its national appellate practice. She has extensive experience arguing cases before the Supreme Court--32 in all and is without question one of the Nation's leading appellate lawyers. Patricia's experience, education, and character have earned her praise from colleagues and clients alike. Following her nomination, the American Bar Association rated her unanimously well qualified to serve as a United States Circuit Judge.  Patricia is also a military spouse, having steadfastly stood by her husband's side as he served his country in uniform for 22 years. As she awaits Senate confirmation, I am proud to say Patricia's nomination is supported by Blue Star Families, by veterans, and active-duty members of the Armed Forces, who today stand with her as she prepares to serve her country once more.
