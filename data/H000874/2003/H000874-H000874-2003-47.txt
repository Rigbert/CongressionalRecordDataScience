Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the leader for his observation. We, I think, are getting different information from our principals. The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel), I think, do not share that same view as to whether or not they have been included, two of our most senior Members of this House, two Members deeply concerned about both issues.  In any event, Mr. Leader, I appreciate the gentleman clarifying the schedule for next week and the week thereafter. That will be helpful to our Members.                          ____________________
