 President, I rise today to pay tribute to the late Lillian A. Hart, a committed public servant and devoted wife, mother and grandmother, who bravely battled cancer in the last several months of her life.  Lillian has made it easy for us to remember her--she has left behind an impressive list of accomplishments that most people only hope to achieve in their lifetime. Lillian was a leader in the community and a role model for many women. She was a pioneer, exploring occupations and civic positions women had never held before.  Lillian was the first woman to be the state executive director of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service in Kentucky, her most recent public position. Lillian served Kentucky in this capacity from 1981 to 1989, and received a national award in 1987, for her work on behalf of farmers and all Kentuckians.  Before Lillian became state executive director, she was also the first woman to be appointed a district director of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service. She served 19 Northern Kentucky counties as district director for 12 years, including in her home county of Pendleton.  Lillian was active in her community, once serving as president of the Pendleton County Republican Women's Club and being chosen as a delegate to the Republican National Convention. She also founded a chapter of Habitat for Humanity in Pendleton County, and was a member of the Kincaid Regional Theatre board of directors.  I am certain that the legacy of excellence that Lillian Hart has left will continue on, and will encourage and inspire others. Hopefully it will be a comfort to the family and friends she leaves behind to know that her efforts to better the community will be felt for years to come. On behalf of myself and my colleagues, we offer our deepest condolences to Lillian's loved ones, and express our gratitude for all she contributed to Pendleton County, the State of Kentucky, and to our great Nation.                          ____________________
