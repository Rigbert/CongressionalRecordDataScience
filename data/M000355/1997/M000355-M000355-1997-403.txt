 BENNETT. I will be happy to yield.  Mr. McCONNELL. Given the general anxiety that candidates for public office experience when independent expenditures, constitutionally protected speech, is directed for or against us, could my friend from Utah not envision a situation in which the Congress would conclude that there should be none, no expenditures in support of, or in opposition to, a candidate? Might not the Congress, in its wisdom, conclude that it was reasonable to have no such expressions by outsiders in the course of the campaign under this amendment?
