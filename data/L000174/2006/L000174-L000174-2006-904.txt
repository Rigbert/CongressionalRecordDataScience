President, again I agree with what the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania has said. This is a bipartisan bill. In fact, to emphasize it, he and I have sent a letter to all of our colleagues, signed jointly, asking them, if they have amendments which they plan to offer, to let us know.  It should be emphasized that not only did we have hours upon hours of hearings, but we had many open meetings in the office of the Senator from Pennsylvania, in my office, and the offices of others. We made sure that the stakeholders, all the stakeholders were able to come to those meetings. We also made sure that the office of every Senator--everybody who expressed any interest, Republican or Democrat--was invited to those meetings.
