Madam Speaker, Cuban political prisoners never have a nice day, so I rise today to remind my colleagues as we meet here in session, more than 400 of Cuba's best, brightest and bravest are suffering unspeakable cruelty at thehands of Fidel Castro and his thugs. The dictator's latest sweep, begun in March, has jailed more than 75 independent journalists and human rights activists.  Afraid and fearful, Castro has now moved to silence all dissent. Castro is a weak and insecure man, utterly afraid to be criticized or held to account. Yet some in Congress still do not get it. They imagine Castro is a man we can do business with. Instead, Castro and his psychotic torturers ought to be at The Hague facing prosecution for crimes against humanity.  Madam Speaker, Castro is a mass murderer, a cruel torturer, and anything but a benign revolutionary.                          ____________________
