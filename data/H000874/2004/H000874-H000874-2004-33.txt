Speaker, I appreciate, A, the majority leader's taking the time to go through those and letting us know where he thinks they may be and whether we will address them next week.  Additionally, when we leave next Friday or Saturday, can the leader tell us, for scheduling purposes, and I know we are going to have the leader's organizational meeting, I think we will schedule our organizational meeting the same week, but is it your view that we will have a lame duck session on November 15 or November 16 and days thereafter?  I yield to my colleague.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, that is still hard to say. I can answer that question better at the end of next week. I am still hoping, against all odds, that the appropriations process could be done. Willing people coming together can get a lot of things done in a very short period of time around here. It is just a matter of finding the willing people to get it done, and we are still working on it. It could happen. Lightning could strike. And if it does, then we would not have to come back in a lame duck.  Obviously, the appropriations process is the most important. And if we cannot get all the appropriations done, then I would anticipate having a lame duck sometime in that week that both parties are organizing.
