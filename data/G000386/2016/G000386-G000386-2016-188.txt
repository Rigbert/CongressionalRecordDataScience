 President, I rise for the purpose of showing how one bureaucracy, the Corps of Engineers--and to some extent the EPA working with them--has already made farming very difficult and how, if the waters of the United States rule goes into effect, it can be much worse than even what I am going to be referring to.  Now, I am going to quote word for word a farmer's problem from the Iowa Farm Bureau's Spokesman dated January 27, 2016, and then I am going to make some comments on it.  For that reason, since I am told the next speaker is not going to come until 10:15, I ask unanimous consent to continue until that time.
