President, I recently learned that Nancy Earle of South Conway, NH, was presented with the New Hampshire Lakes Association John F. Morton Annual Award for Exemplary Service, 2004.  I mention this for two reasons. First, although Nancy is not a Vermonter, she and her husband Rink Earle once lived in Putney, VT where three sons and two granddaughters later attended the Putney School, her husband has a niece who lives in Norwich, VT, and they both have close friends in Vermont. Second, this award honors Nancy for her tireless work to protect New Hampshire's many beautiful lakes, lakes which not only citizens of New Hampshire, but Vermonters and people from around the country, as well as from other countries, enjoy particularly in the summer months.  Protecting the environment is a global challenge, but much if not most of the work is done at the local level. New Hampshire's lakes, like Vermont's and every State's, are threatened by rapid development along their shores, by pollutants caused from marine craft and by over-fishing. It is concerned individuals like Nancy Earle, motivated by nothing more than their sense of responsibility to protect these fragile aquatic ecosystems for the use and enjoyment of future generations to whom we owe a debt of gratitude.  I want to congratulate Nancy for this award, and to commend the New Hampshire Lakes Association for paying tribute to such a fine and deserving person. Nancy was the president of the Walker's Pond Association in Conway for over 30 years. She will be 86 years old this December 24, and despite a recent bout with cancer I suspect that, health permitting, Nancy Earle will continue to do what she can to protect New Hampshire's lakes.                          ____________________
