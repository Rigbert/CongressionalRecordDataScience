 President, I am proud to introduce today with Senator Dorgan the Restitution for Victims of Crime Act of 2006.  This bill is needed to recover some of the mounting uncollected Federal criminal debt. The Federal Government is collecting just pennies on each dollar of Federal criminal debt that is owed. In my home State of Iowa for fiscal year 2005, for example, the Justice Department has an outstanding balance of nearly $82 million in uncollected criminal debt. Compared to other districts, Iowa's northern and southern districts have relatively small outstanding balances. Nationwide, over $41 billion remains outstanding.  The Restitution for Victims of Crime Act improves the procedures used to collect restitution. It also provides the authority to preserve assets to satisfy restitution orders. This bill gives our Federal criminal justice system the channels they need to not only successfully prosecute criminals but to recover the debts owed.  Both the Justice Department and the victims' rights community support this bill and recognize that it will significantly improve the current collection system.  This is an important bill and I am glad to join my good friend from North Dakota in introducing it.                          ____________________
