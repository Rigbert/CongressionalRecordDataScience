 President, let me add one final letter before I turn it over to my colleague from South Dakota who has been waiting in the Chamber.  This is a letter from Bill Gilbertson of Sequim, WA. He says to me:       Dear Senator Murray: Thank you for your support of S.1708,      Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act.       Your comments to the Senate, describing the real life      problems of being unemployed will hopefully encourage passage      of this important matter.       Please pass on my comments to your colleagues who don't      know what its like to be jobless.       Life without a job is a demeaning experience; it affects      all aspects of your life.       You have to be very careful with the little money you have,      only necessities can be considered.       Fear, low self image, feeling of lack, and despair of the      future are some of the challenges you face when hit by      unemployment.       I have been unemployed now for over a year, it's been      tough, but I won't give up till I get a job.       Extension of S. 1708 would really help me thru this.  That is Bill Gilbertson of Sequim, WA.  We are talking about real people facing real problems. I think it is essential that this Senate deal with this issue now.                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1853  Because of that, I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that the Senate proceed to legislative session and the Finance Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. 1853, a bill to extend unemployment insurance benefits for displaced workers; that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration, the bill be read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid on the table.
