Virtually every State has lost jobs. We have lost over 20,000 manufacturing jobs in the last 12 months with the last Bush tax cut. Adding insult to injury is the fact that this administration resists providing additional unemployment compensation for people who are out of work. When his father faced recession, five different times we increased unemployment compensation, three times under President Bush, and twice under President Clinton. We have only done it twice in this situation.  To me, it is heartless to ignore what is happening to unemployed people. They have lost good jobs. Some of them have been victims of corporate scandals. They are in trouble, trying to find some way to get by. Every single day is a challenge. We find over a fourth of them have had to leave their homes and move in with family and friends. We find over half of them struggling to pay utility bills. More and more of them are paying less for food and clothing for their family and ultimately many of them are losing health insurance--words Republicans don't want to talk about, the cost of health insurance. That is an indication of what we should be focusing on in terms of our priorities. Instead, what we are doing is increasing the deficit at the expense of Social Security and Medicare. That is not fair.
