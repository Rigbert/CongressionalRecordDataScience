 President, I further ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported substitute amendment be withdrawn, that the Baldwin substitute amendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to, that the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.
