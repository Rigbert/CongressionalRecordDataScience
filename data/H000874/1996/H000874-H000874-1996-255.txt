Speaker, all of Washington and the Nation watched over some 7 days as America wondered what happened to the former Director of the CIA, William Colby. William Colby served his country in war and in peace. He served it with integrity and with commitment.                              {time}  1415  Tragically, his body was found 7 days after his canoe was discovered. He had drowned.  I had the opportunity of talking to his widow, Sally Shelton Colby, and when I talked to her, she was thankful for the volunteers and paid personnel of so many agencies who had throughout her vigil exercised their skill and their judgment in the search for an answer to why he was missing.  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the efforts of more than 100 individuals, both paid and volunteer, who spent many hours in the cold waters and on the shoreline of the Wicomico River searching for the late William Colby.  The search ended early Monday morning after his body was discovered near the shoreline, ending, Mr. Speaker, an intense search that began on the 28th of April. There were many agencies and organizations involved in the search, as is always the case when neighbors get in trouble. That search was headed by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources Police. They did an outstanding job, and I want to recognize not only them but all the participants in this search, including the sheriff of Charles County, MD, Fred Davis, and the men and women of the Charles County Sheriff's Department who handled press inquiries, protected the Colby residence, and facilitated in the search.  The search involved countless volunteer hours and assistance from the Maryland State Police, aviation division; the Charles County dive team, who were the first divers in the search; the Cobb Island Volunteer Fire Department and emergency medical team; the 7th District Volunteer Fire Department, Boat 5 from the home county of myself, St. Mary's County; the Marbury Volunteer Fire Department, using their rescue boat and dive team; the Bel Alton Volunteer Fire Department; the St. Mary's County Sheriff's Department dive team, led by Sheriff Voorhaar; the Calvert County dive team; the U.S. Coast Guard; the Prince George's County dive team, Companies22, 49, and 56; the LaPlata Volunteer Fire Department; the Sardom search and rescue dogs; the Cobb Island Volunteer Fire Department Ladies Auxiliary.  Let me stop at the Cobb Island Ladies Auxiliary. I had the opportunity to talk to Gilda Farrell Wednesday night. Talked to her about the efforts of herself and the members of the auxiliary, and told her that Sally Shelton Colby expressed to me how persons who did not know her or her family were so warm in a time of crisis, were so uplifting at a time of tragedy, and how they had related to the entire Colby family at this time and given them comfort as well as aid.  In addition, the Charles County Communications Department; the Virginia State Marine Police; the Naval Surface Warfare Center EOD dive team and the rescue squad dive team from Dahlgren, VA; and numerous local citizens who volunteered in many, many different ways.  I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing the efforts of the paid and volunteer members of this very special community. These individuals engage in hundreds of hours of specialized training and continuing education to enhance life-saving skills, just to be ready for emergency rescue calls and searches. Charles County and other communities across America benefit daily from the services of these dedicated professionals who are ready 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and they deserve our continued thanks.  Mr. Speaker, I know that you share my pride at the efforts of the volunteer fire and rescue service personnel and other agencies involved in the intense search for Mr. Colby, which lasted more than 7 days.                          ____________________
