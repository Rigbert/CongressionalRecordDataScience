All gasoline includes butane and, as far as I am aware, always has. Adding butane during the gasoline refining process is simply how gasoline is produced. The idea that Congress intended oil companies to benefit from a credit intended to reduce our dependence on traditional gasoline by rewarding them for making traditional gasoline doesn't pass the commonsense test. This is why the Internal Revenue Service has correctly denied such claims. However, the oil industry is litigating this issue in the hopes of winning a nearly $50 billion windfall for producing gasoline the same way they have for a century. Mr. Chairman, am I correct that Congress never intended for gasoline to qualify for this credit based on its butane content?
