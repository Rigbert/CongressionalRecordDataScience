 President, I yield myself 10 more minutes. I know that is all the time I have, but I think what General Sheehan says is very important.  General Sheehan has hit the nail on the head, and this is his main argument:       Bloated staff organizations have created a demand for      personnel that can starve warfighting units into hollowness.  A hollow fighting unit like we had in the late 1970's, in other words.  Bloated command staffs and headquarters are an outgrowth of top-heavy rank. In other words, General Sheehan is saying, we have excess admirals and generals, and each one needs a home, and every senior officer needs a command, a headquarters, a base, a staff, or a large department of some kind, somewhere, someplace to look over.  Take the Navy, for example. At the height of World War II, the Navy had 6,768 ships. Those 6,768 ships were commanded by 333 admirals. That is one admiral for about 20 ships. Today's 363-ship Navy is commanded by 218 admirals. That is almost one admiral for every ship. To be precise, it is one and two-thirds ships per admiral.  General Sheehan is wrestling with this problem, and doing it from the standpoint of a person serving his country, in uniform, on the line where the money is being spent--or should we say, on the line where the money is being wasted.  He told the audience that he is searching for technical solutions to the problems of swollen staff organizations. This is what he had to say:       What is needed are systems that can help reduce the      overhead costs for commanding large forces. With all this      technology and smarts running around, why aren't we more      efficient?  That is a question that every Senator ought to ask before he votes for this bill.  In other words, General Sheehan has made an excellent case for cutting infrastructure costs.  The military today is top-heavy with rank and staff organizations and command headquarters left over from the cold war. That is the official word from the commander of the United States Atlantic Command. That is a pretty good authority.  General Sheehan has clearly identified the culprit. He obviously understands the problem. And he is also frustrated by his inability to get rid of his own excess command fat.  We know that the Department of Defense cannot do it, so we need to help them. So if you vote for my amendment, you will help General Sheehan do what he says he sees is necessary to get more bang for their defense dollar.  He put it this way:       Nobody likes to cut their own staff.  He goes on to say:       I've never seen a butcher hand a pig a cleaver and say,      ``Go make pork chops.''  So Congress needs to lend a helping hand to people like General Sheehan.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this report about General Sheehan's speech printed in the Record, the article from Inside the Pentagon.  There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From Inside the Pentagon, June 13, 1996]     Atlantic Commander Criticizes Profusion of Staff Organizations                         (By Douglas Berenson)       Marine Corps Gen. John Sheehan, commander-in-chief of the      U.S. Atlantic Command; last week decried the profusion of      staff organizations within the Department of Defense, arguing      they consume too many personnel and resources, and therefore      put at risk already strained force structure. Sheehan, who      has previously targeted the top-heavy command structure of      the NATO alliance (Inside the Pentagon, Sept. 21, 1995, pl),      offered his remarks at a June 6 breakfast hosted by the      Association of the U.S. Army's Institute for Land Warfare.       ``There is a debate that's being formed right now, where      the only sides are in the debate [are] modernization versus      force structure. My argument says we ought to take a very      serious top-down look at the overhead costs of doing      business. Why do we have so many headquarters? Of what value      are they?'' Sheehan asked.       Sheehan noted that within the Department of Defense, there      are 199 staff organizations of two-star level of above, a      number that has not changed since 1989. As an example, he      cited the fact that the U.S. Army in Europe has 23 staff      echelons to command 65,000 soldiers. He said that U.S.      Southern Command offered another example of a top-heavy      organization. ``Why is it, for example, that you have      SOUTHCOM [with] 770 officers commanding less than 4,000      men?'' he wondered.       He argued that these bloated staff organizations have      created a demand for personnel that can starve warfighting      units into hollowness. ``Why is it that the Bradley fighting      vehicle spends so much time in gunnery when you go into the      field? Why is it you don't spend more time in the integration      of operations of the rifle unit coming out the back [of the      Bradley]? It's because of this process,'' Sheehan said,      noting that Bradley infantry squads are often fielded at      lower than their optimum strength.       Sheehan argued that the ``tooth-to-tail'' ratio has become      badly skewed against the warfighter, such that, ``we field in      the entire Army 125,000 killers.'' The rest of the force is      made up of support and staff personnel, he said. Sheehan      warned that the staff non-commissioned officer corps is being      decimated, and that as the services focus on freeing up money      to spend on force modernization, they are ``forcing great      people out of the system.''       Sheehan noted that Army Chief of Staff Gen. Dennis Reimer      has been working to streamline the Army's structure in      response to these problems. ``Dennis Reimer has to be allowed      to go after the European staff structure. He has got to be      allowed to go after the SOUTHCOM staff structure and take      some of that staff structure out to keep combat capability.''       Sheehan warned that ``the next organization to go is the      2nd ACR [Armored Cavalry Regiment]. That would be a travesty.      We need light, mobile attack type forces with a protected gun      system for the battlefield of the future.''       ``Nobody likes to cut their own staff,'' Sheehan observed,      quipping, ``I've never seen a butcher hand a pig a cleaver      and say, `Go make pork chops.'''       Sheehan appealed to the assembled audience to help find      technical solutions to the problem of swollen staff      organizations. What is needed, he said, are systems that can      help reduce the overhead costs for commanding large forces.      ``With all this technology and smarts running around, why      aren't we more efficient?''       As he has in the past, Sheehan levelled similar criticism      against the NATO command structure. In addition to his      responsibilities as U.S. Atlantic Command chief, Sheehan      serves simultaneously as Supreme Allied Commander of NATO's      Atlantic Command. ``As a major NATO commander, my main      complaint against my NATO allies is that many of these      countries took their force structure out and took a peace      dividend without reinvesting in the future. [But] they didn't      take the overhead out . . .       ``There are still 65 NATO headquarters, with over 21,000      staff officers sitting around doing paperwork,'' Sheehan      continued. ``That's more staff officers than two NATO nations      have land forces. And so you ask yourself, of $1.79 billion      we invest in NATO on a burdensharing basis, why is $800      million of that just in infrastructure?''
