Speaker, on July 18, 2012, I was absent from the House and missed rollcall vote 481.  Had I been present for rollcall 481, on agreeing to the Woolsey amendment to reduce the total amount of appropriations made by the bill by $181,000,000, I would have voted ``no.''                          ____________________
