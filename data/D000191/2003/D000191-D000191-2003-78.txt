This document, which has become publicly available, is the coalition provisional authority request to rehabilitate and reconstruct Baghdad, Iraq. Published accordingly, Baghdad, Iraq, is a gold-plated guide to war profiteering. I urge each and every tax-paying American citizen to get a copy to see where the $20.3 billion that President Bush wants to borrow in their name to send to Iraq will be spent.  We have already had some examples of just incredible waste. There was a cement plant in northern Iraq needed repair. Mr. Bremer sent in his experts. They said it would cost $15 million. The Iraqis could not wait, and they went ahead and repaired it for $80,000.  There was the $25 million spent to rebuild police stations in Basra. The Iraqis estimate they could have done it for $5 million or less.  Then there was the $5,000-per-day contract Mr. Bremer signed to feed the Iraqi governing council, all 25 of them. I guess we were going to fly over catered meals from the United States of America. The governing council was so appalled at that waste of money, even though it was being spent by the United States of America, borrowed by the President on behalf of the American people, they cancelled the contract, got some local food for a fraction of the cost.  Then, of course, on the governing council, we have Mr. Ahmad Al-Barak, and he estimates that in cases the savings could be a factor of 10. Where they spend $1 billion, we would spend $100 billion. If we carry that formula through, instead of borrowing $20.3 billion on behalf of the American people and spending it to rebuild Iraq, as the President wants to do, we could do it for $2.3 billion or less.  There are other things in this new proposal that are a bit strange. There is the proposal of $33,000 per pickup truck delivered in Iraq. I went online just to kind of check out a pretty nice 2003 new Ford F-150, two door regular cab, XL, two-wheel drive, style side, with the AC and the automatic transmission and of course destination charge, $17,817. Does not have armor plating, but then again neither do the Humvees that this administration gave to our troops who are being killed on a daily basis.  There are other things that I would question here, $20 million to develop and train a cadre of business people in Iraq. That is a 4-week course, $10,000 each. By equivalent it would cost $4,000 to send them to Harvard, or if we send them to a continuing-education course at a community college in my district, we could put them through a good course, one term, with credits, for $400. But the Bush administration wants to spend $10,000 per Iraqi, $20 million borrowed from the American people, spent to give these $10,000 4-week courses to Iraqis.  Then, of course, there is a lot of, like, well, we have an obligation to all the damage we did to the country. I guess we blew up their wireless Internet network. Whoops, wait a minute. They did not have wireless Internet network, did they? No, they did not, but an essential part of this reconstruction effort is that we provide a wireless Internet network for all the Iraqis and their laptop computers. I do not know how many Iraqis have laptop computers, but I think that is somewhere else in the request perhaps. Although we cannot equip our kids, our schools with laptop computers, we are going to give them to Iraqis.  There are other things that have more merit arguably, $5.8 billion to rebuild their power grid and electrical system. I thought, well, maybe we did that. I found out it was not necessarily for damage we caused. In fact, Mr. Bremer was quoted saying, well, I have been into the plants, they have got these boilers from the 1950s and 1960s; they are holding them together with duct tape. What does that have to do with the war? What obligation does that put on the American people? Why should we borrow money on behalf of the American people, though it will be repaid and there is a lot of talk about children and grandchildren, by tax paying Americans today, children and grandchildren of tax paying Americans, to give the Iraqis state-of-the-art cycled turbines to generate electricity in Iraq? They cannot use the old system; we cannot just put that back together for a fraction of cost. No, they have got to have a brand new system. Of course, here in the United States of America where lights blinked out in the West a few years ago, blinked out in the East this year, the President cannot find any money to invest in our system and keep our lights on, but we can give them a state-of-the-art system there in Iraq.  If we spent this $20.3 billion on infrastructure and critical needs in the United States of America. Even if we borrowed it on behalf of the American people and spent it on behalf of the American people, we could provide 1 million jobs in this country. This provides for nothing but war profiteering to generous contributors to the Bush administration.                          ____________________
