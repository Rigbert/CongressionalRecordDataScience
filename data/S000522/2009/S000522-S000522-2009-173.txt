Madam Speaker, pursuant to the Republican Leadership standards on earmarks, I am submitting the following information regarding earmarks I received as part of the FY 10 Homeland Security Appropriation Act.  Requesting Member: Rep. Christopher H Smith   Bill Number: H.R. 2892  Account: Federal Emergency Management Agency's Pre-Disaster Mitigation  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: City of Trenton  Address of Requesting Entity: 319 East State Street, Trenton, NJ 08608  Description of Request: Funding will be used to help fortify the City's water filtration plant from ongoing flooding and contamination risk. The plant is responsible for providing safe drinking water to 225,000 people in Trenton, Hamilton and surrounding Mercer County areas.  Work supported with the $300,000 in federal funds--which the city of Trenton will match with $100,000--will protect the drinking water supply by eliminating vulnerabilities to contamination resulting from future flood events. The city will use it to waterproof open areas, relocate vulnerable controls and electronics, and make improvements to the sump pump system and the Chlorination storage facility.                          ____________________
