President, on Wednesday, July 28, Paul Scott Howell of Edmond, Oklahoma was shot and killed as he pulled into the driveway of his parents' home. The apparent motive is carjacking. At the time of his death, Mr. Howell was returning from a shopping trip for school supplies with his daughters and his sister. Fortunately, his daughters and sister were not harmed.  On Monday, August 2, the City of Edmond mourned this senseless death. It was clear from the tone of the service and from those who attended that Paul was loved and admired by many. Although I never had the pleasure of knowing Paul, I suspect that not only have his family and friends suffered a great loss but the entire country has as well because Paul was one of those people that we all wish we could be like. I think Carol Hartzog, the Managing Editor of the Edmond Sun newspaper says it best in a recent column, ``You would have liked Paul Howell.'' Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record Ms. Hartzog's tribute to Paul Scott Howell.  The tribute follows:                  [From The Edmond Sun, Aug. 3, 1999]                    You Would Have Liked Paul Howell                           (By Carol Hartzog)       Paul Howell's life went full circle.       Four-year-old ``Paulie'' was blessed by a security that      only a 1950s-era Edmond could provide. It was an idyllic      time. Forty years later, Paul was gunned down dead in his      boyhood neighborhood last Wednesday. He was a blessed      youngster, and through life's trials, has been gifted as an      adult. He would in turn bless all who knew him.       Despite his death, his testament will live on.       Often, the media will make a victim of random violence into      a larger-than-life character.       But in this case, Paul Howell ministered to so many, young      and old. On one hand, he would light up a room with his      bounding presence, his boisterous, fun-loving way. On the      other hand, in an unassuming way, this 45-year-old man would      mentor to those who had fallen victim of the bottle and      sought help from Alcoholics Anonymous.       Not only was he a recovering alcoholic, but he had such a      passion for it that his story will live--and benefit--so many      long after his death. He carried the message to other      alcoholics, and mentored them through their steps of      recovery.       ``Paul didn't just use AA,'' his brother Bill told me. ``AA      used him to continue to reach out to others. . . . He grabbed      hold of it. He was available all the time, and pushed other      people into it, and I was so proud of him doing it.''       ``It takes a special person to let go of that anonymity,''      Bill said. Paul really didn't care. He was so happy that AA      had changed his life, he wanted to reach out and change as      many people as he could.       ``That's the real wonder of Paul.''       Paul took AA's philosophy to the ultimate degree--one day      at a time. A funeral for an alcoholic often gathers a handful      of people. Often, there has been no road to recovery, only to      death, either by your own hand or another's.       In contrast, Paul Howell's funeral Monday was a      celebration--a celebration of one who had triumphed. And with      Paul's gifts of an award-winning smile, his sense of humor an      his good looks, he helped so many because of his Maker.       Because of his hardships, he connected with the youth of      his church, relating his failures and his message, ``Don't do      to your parents what I did.''       Howell's funeral Monday brought people from all the      ``walks'' of his life--his boyhood chums, his AA friends and      the community of faith that had been there, literally, from      the beginning.       I never had the pleasure of meeting Paul. But it was      evident from the many I visited with that what I have said is      true. He and his family touched many lives. His family roots      extend to the Land Run here.       Sitting next to me was the 80-something year-old retired      church organist, who accompanied Paul's mother, Dorothy, and      the rest of the choir. The musician watched little Paul and      his older brothers grow up.       On the other side of me was Larry, a business associate in      the insurance industry. Paul would visit Larry's office at      least monthly. He has a gregarious nature.       ``I expect by now, he's met everyone in heaven and they all      like him,'' he said. ``He never met a stranger. Although,      last week, he did.''       And then there's the teen-ager who was in Paul's ninth- and      10th-grade Sunday School class.       ``He was really cool,'' Matt said. Paul would occasionally      give him tickets to University of Oklahoma ball games.       Leroy spoke at Howell's funeral Monday. Leroy is ``A friend      of Bill W.,'' as the funeral bulletin would state. That      reference is to the founder of AA.       Through powerful, audible terms, all those who attended the      funeral knew Paul's influence through AA. When Leroy spoke      from the pulpit and said, ``Hello, my name is Leroy and I'm a      recovering alcoholic. . . .'' I would surmise a third of      those in attendance said, ``Hello, Leroy,'' the standard      response spoken in unison at AA meetings. You knew Paul was a      testament to the power of AA.       The diversity of Paul's scope of influence was apparent.      The sanctuary was overflowing. There were hundreds lining its      walls, in the foyer, the crying rooms and other anterooms--     1,200 people in all, it's estimated. The altar area was      covered with 25 flower arrangements--the huge kind that would      only look small in the setting of a British cathedral. Dozens      more lesser arrangements filled in what space was left.       Paul's memorial service was also a testament to Edmond--a      community coming together to pay its respects to the victim      of such a random, senseless act.       In the 1950's this then-small town would give Paulie a      Rockwell-esque setting in which to grow up. The town's      population was 9,000. First Christian Church provided the      security that came with that.       He and his two older brothers would bound over fences to      the neighbors' houses where the Gibsons and the Rices lived.      He grew up in a tight-knit neighborhood where many of his      playmates remained to adulthood and to adult      responsibilities. That's unique in Edmond today, where a      third of our population didn't live here five years ago.       His youthful years became troubled with normal teen-age      problems, drinking being a part of that.       Twelve years ago, his life took another turn when he      admitted his alcoholism and sought help with AA. That road      would take him to a new high, a pinnacle that few reach when      struggling with alcoholism.       His community of faith at First Christian Church would walk      with him. And along that long stretch, he touched so many. He      had been given a gift of new life through AA, and he has been      giving back over the years.       This community has pulled together before--the 1986 tornado      that struck our town but miraculously took no lives. The post      office massacre that same year that took 15 citizens. And the      Murrah Building bombing that took 19 Edmond residents.       We don't get any better at coping.       But we know, as the Rev. Kyle Maxwell so eloquently stated      Monday, that ``suffering got us here (through the crucifixion      of Christ on the Cross).''       Let's not ``try to make sense out of the senseless crime,''      Maxwell said.       ``The `why?' of it is that God created us to be free.      Sometimes that's too heavy a burden for some people.'' He has      given us the freedom to be compassionate and the freedom to      take another's life, Maxwell said.       I believe that Christians are to be people of grace and of      forgiveness. We are as sinful as the people who took Paul's      life. In this case, society places consequences on those sins      acted out. But, Jesus said that any sin is just as deadly,      even if it is, unspoken and remains in the heart.       You are to forgive, for if you don't, anger will literally      eat away any energy or beauty that Paul may have placed in      your hearts.       That's what it's all about. Grace. And if you are not at      that point to forgive in your journey, say so. Make a      commitment to try.       The families of those in jail who are on this side of      heaven and going through a worldly hell need your prayers.       I believe Paul would have been right there, leading the      prayer service for those sinners like himself. He has      experienced his own private hell and knew from whence they      came.                          ____________________
