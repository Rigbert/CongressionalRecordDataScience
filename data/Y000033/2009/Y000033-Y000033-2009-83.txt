Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Hostelling International USA for 75 years of service to youth travel.  Hostelling International USA was founded in 1934 to improve and promote international understanding of the world and its countless cultures through hostelling. Hostelling International operates and maintains almost 70 hostel accommodations throughout the United States, with over 4,000 locations worldwide. These inexpensive and safe facilities range from high-rise buildings with hundreds of beds to small remote hostels in rural setting found throughout Alaska.  Hostel volunteers act as ambassadors for their communities and for our nation by administering travel education programs to young and old. Alaskan hostels have welcomed and housed guests since the early 1960's, in a diverse set of locations including: Central Juneau, Ketchikan, Nome, Anchorage, Delta Junction, Fairbanks, Haines, Homer, Sitka, Tok, Willow, Girdwood, Slana and Ninilchik.  I commend Hostelling International USA for its 75 years of continued quality service.                          ____________________
