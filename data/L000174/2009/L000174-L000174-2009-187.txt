President, the Senate has concluded consideration of the nomination of Sonia Sotomayor and has confirmed her as a Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. The consideration of a nomination for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court is one of our most consequential responsibilities. The consideration of the nomination of Sonia Sotomayor has been a credit to the Judiciary Committee and to the Senate.  We could not give this process the attention it deserves without the help of dedicated staff. For 2\1/2\ months, the staff of the Judiciary Committee has worked long hours dutifully to help Senators in their review. I wish to thank the following members of the majority staff in particular: Jeremy Paris, Erica Chabot, Kristine Lucius, Roscoe Jones, Shanna Singh Hughey, Maggie Whitney, Sarah Hackett, Michael Gerhardt, Elise Burditt, Noah Bookbinder, Stephen Kelly, Kelsey Kobelt, Matt Virkstis, Anya McMurray, Juan Valdivieso, CurtisLeGeyt, Zulima Espinel, Tara Magner, Roslyne Turner, Erin O'Neill, Sarah Guerrieri, Brian Hockin, Joseph Thomas, Leila George-Wheeler, Laura Safdie, Kathleen Roberts, Aaron Guile, Matt Smith, Lydia Griggsby, Patrick Sheahan, Scott Wilson, Dave Stebbins, Sarah Hasazi, Kiera Flynn, Bree Bang-Jensen, Tom Wheeler, Eric Poalino, Brad Wilhelm, Lauren Rosser, Chuck Papirmeister, and Bruce Cohen. I also thank my staff for their hard work on this nomination, in particular, Ed Pagano, David Carle, Jennifer Price, and Kevin McDonald.  I commend and thank the hard-working staffs of the other Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee for their tremendous contributions to this effort. I also want to extend considerable thanks to the Democratic leadership and floor staff, in particular Serena Hoy, Mike Spahn, Stacy Rich, and Joi Chaney.  I also commend and thank Senator Sessions, the committee's ranking Republican, and his staff, in particular, Brian Benczkowski, Elisebeth Cook, Danielle Brucchieri, and Lauren Pastarnack, for their hard work and professionalism.                          ____________________
