 I understand, in addition, that the Appropriations Committee continues to mark up bills this week to pass their fourth bill, the Transportation-HUD bill, out of committee.  The question I would propound to the majority leader, Mr. Speaker, is whether or not we anticipate completing the markup of the 12 appropriation bills before the August break?  I yield to the majority Leader.
