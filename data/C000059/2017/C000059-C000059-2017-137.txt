Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Paul Edward Bell, Colonel, U.S. Air Force (Retired), who passed away in California on November 16, 2016. Col. Bell dedicated thirty-three years of his life to serve in our military and he will be deeply missed.  Shortly after his high school graduation, Col. Bell enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps as an aviation cadet. During World War II, Col. Bell served as a B-24 crew member. Throughout the war, he participated in conflicts on the islands of Morotai, Indonesia and Okinawa, Japan, as well as in support of the final bombing offensive in the Pacific. Col. Bell flew 251 combat missions amassing 862 combat hours in fighter, bomber and rotary wing aircraft. His awards and decorations included the Legion of Merit with four oak leaf clusters, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the Air Medal with eleven oak leaf clusters, just to name some of the many medals he received.  Even after leaving the military, Col. Bell continued his public service through his participation in numerous community, military support groups and veteran's organizations. He was a member of the Knights of Columbus, the Elks and the Newcomen Society. He was an area vice president for the California Air Force Association; was on the governing boards of the Silver Eagles, the March Field Air Museum,the Forum, the Riverside Chamber Military Affairs Committee and the 15th Air Force Association. Col. Bell was instrumental in establishing several historic sites on March Air Reserve Base, persuaded Bob Hope to allow the Riverside chapter of the Air Force Association be named in his honor, and established the chapter's annual ``Air Crew Excellence Award'' for airmen of the 4th Air Force. In 1995, Col. Bell was recognized by Air Mobility Command as its Citizen of the Year. Col. Bell's significant contributions to the base, its units, its uniformed members and government employees will long preserve March Air Reserve Base's legacy in Riverside history.  I had the distinct privilege of knowing Col. Bell for many years and I will deeply miss him. I extend my heartfelt condolences to Col. Bell's wife, Helen, as well as the entire Bell family. Although Col. Bell may be gone, his selfless dedication to our nation will long be remembered.                          ____________________
