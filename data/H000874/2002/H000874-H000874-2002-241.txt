Chairman, I yield myself 35 seconds.  We believe the interpretation of the gentleman from Virginia and the majority whip is absolutely incorrect; wrong. It does not do what they say it does.  However, having said that, for the Record, it is clearly the drafters' intent that it not allow, nor do we believe it does allow, the use of soft money to pay hard money bills.  So the interpretation is clear, and the intent is without question. The representations of the chairman of the NRCC are incorrect.
