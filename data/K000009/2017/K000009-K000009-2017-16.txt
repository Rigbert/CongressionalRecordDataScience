 Madam Speaker, the GOP-led tax and deficit disaster rewards the big corporations and billionaires. It will accelerate job outsourcing. Indeed, 50 percent of the tax benefits go to the top 1 percent.  This tax scam locks in--get this--a $621,500 tax bonus to each billionaire in the billionaire class, the top one-tenth of 1 percent. Do you really think they need it?  Meanwhile, this tax scam raids money from the pockets of 38 million middle class taxpayers, likely those caring for their sick relatives or trying to help their kids in college. Do youreally think the one-tenth of 1 percent need more?  Money-trading Wall Street megabanks like Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan, already making billions, will get more tax bonuses courtesy of the middle class.
