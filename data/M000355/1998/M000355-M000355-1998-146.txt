  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.              the child survival and disease programs fund  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to express my strong support for the Child Survival and Disease Program Fund. I understand that the House Committee on Appropriations, as a part of its Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Bill, has recommended that $650 million be allocated to the Fund's programs for fiscal year 1999. On the House side, Subcommittee Chairman Callahan has taken the lead in protecting these child survival programs and I commend him for his leadership on this issue. The Clinton administration, however, has reduced direct funding for child survival programs. In order to preserve the benefits of these important programs for children worldwide, I believe the Senate should accept in conference the House language that was agreed to in Committee for this Fund.  It is a tragedy that millions of children die each year from disease, malnutrition, and other consequences of poverty that are both preventable and treatable. The programs of the Child Survival Fund, which are intended to reduce infant mortality and improve the health and nutrition of children, address the various problems of young people struggling to survive in developing countries. It places a priority on the needs of the more than 100 million children worldwide who are displaced and/or have become orphans.  The Fund includes initiatives to curb the resurgence of communicable diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. In the underdeveloped world, the Fund works towards eradicating polio as well as preventing and controlling the spread of HIV/AIDS.  Aside from addressing issues of health, the Fund also supports basic education programs. An investment in education yields one of the highest social and economic rates of return--because it gives children the necessary tools to become self-sufficient adults. Each additional year of primary and secondary schooling results in a 10-20% wage increase and a 25% net increase in income.  The programs supported by the Child Survival Fund are effective because they save three million lives each year through immunizations, vitamin supplementation, oral rehydration therapy, and the treatment of childhood respiratory infections, which are the second largest killer of children on earth. This year the Kiwanis International are leading a global campaign to raise seventy-five million dollars toward the elimination of Iodine Deficiency Disorder which is the world's most prevalent cause of preventable mental retardation in children. Eliminating the symptoms and causes of this poverty is not only the humane thing to do--it is also a necessary prerequisite for global stability and prosperity.  In my view, Congress needs to maintain its support for these valuable programs. It is my hope that the Senate Foreign Operations Subcommittee will accept the House language. The Child Survival and Disease programs are effective and are important. They should be continued. I would like to commend Representatives Tony Hall of Ohio and Sonny Callahan of Alabama for their tireless leadership in the effort to eliminate global hunger.  I see the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Operations Subcommittee on the floor.  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Ohio for his statement. I have listened very carefully to his remarks, and I commend him for his tireless efforts in supporting children's causes, here in the United States and throughout the world. I would like to assure him that I will give every possible consideration to his request when we go to conference.  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my distinguished friend from Kentucky, and I yield the floor.
