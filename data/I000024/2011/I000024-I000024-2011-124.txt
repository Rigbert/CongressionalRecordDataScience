I want to be sure that something I have been talking about over the last days has now come to a peak where we must do something.  I have been concerned about what is happening in Cote d'Ivoire, in west Africa. I am very close to the situation. I have had occasion to be there over the last few years nine different times. I know the President is there, the current President and his wife, Laurent and Simone Gbagbo. I was familiar with the election that came around, so I have been on the floor talking about what I believe should happen there, that we should call for a new election. Unfortunately, the United States and our State Department--I will be very critical of them--have joined with the United Nations and with France in taking the side of Alassane Ouattara from the north who was the challenger, who has been challenging this administration now for at least 10 years that I know of.  I got a scathing reply from the Ambassador to the United States from France. I am not going to read it. I am not going to enter it into the Record. It doesn't make any sense. I only wish to respond to a couple of things in that letter. First of all, they talk about the fact that this was a legitimate election and it was certified properly and it was in accordance with the Constitution of Cote d'Ivoire, and I don't believe that. I will respond to that by saying the independent electoral commission did not fulfill its constitutional mandate to announce the final provision vote tallies within 3 days. That is what the Constitution says in the country of Cote d'Ivoire and west Africa. It announced then, almost 16 hours after it was constitutionally mandated, to report them to the Constitutional Council. It is my understanding it is the Constitutional Council of Cote d'Ivoire and not the electoral commission which certifies and declares the winner of Presidential elections.  On three occasions now I have talked about this election and the abuses that were taking place. In one case we had information that was given to me by members of the opposing party to President Gbagbo where they submitted that in one of the five regions in the north--let's keep in mind the challenger, Ouattara, is from the north, a Muslim area up there. They had, in five of these regions--in one of them--149,598--and I showed how it was calculated. I showed the actual results that were there from the electoral process, and this was just one of five northern cities. But when the total was officially reported in the total vote column, Ouattara received 244,000 votes, a difference of almost 95,000 votes.  If you do your math and you say this happened in all five of these areas in northern Cote d'Ivoire, that would be more than enough to declare--enough mistakes that would take the election away from the duly reelected President, President Gbagbo. If you don't want to get into the weeds that far, all you have to do is look at the results they had. In that election they came out with the results that said Gbagbo in those northern precincts--we call them precincts, they call them something else--that they actually had thousands and thousands of votes in what we would call the primary, but when the primary runoff came up, he got zero votes. That is a statistical impossibility. So I have given all those things to our State Department, and I haven't gotten any positive response.  In the accusations in the letter the French say he refused to accept--he being Gbagbo--refused to accept proposals by the African union, a high-level group, while these proposals have been formally accepted by President Ouattara. It is not true, just flat not true. As late as March 27 the African Union sent former Cape Verde Foreign Minister Jose Brito to mediate between Ouattara and Gbagbo. Gbagbo accepted the mediation, Ouattara didn't.  I have a whole list of the accusations that were made and my response to these accusations, and I am going to be submitting them at this portion in my presentation in lieu of reading them at this time. I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           Inhofe Fact Check on French Embassy ``Fact Sheet''              (From the French Ambassador, April 6, 2011)     French say:     Fact Sheet on Cote d'Ivoire     (April 6, 2011)       ``After many delays, including on the part of then-     President Laurent Gbagbo, a presidential election was held in      Cote d'Ivoire last fall. Since then, its results have been      certified by the local monitoring mission and acknowledged by      the international community, including the United States, the      European Union (EU), the Economic Community of West Africa      States (ECOWAS), and the African Union (AU).''     Inhofe responds:       In fact the Independent Electoral Commission did not      fulfill its constitutional mandate to announce the final      provisional vote tallies within three days. It announced them      almost 16 hours after it was constitutionally mandated to      report them to the Constitutional Council. And it is my      understanding, that it is the Constitutional Council of Cote      d'Ivoire and not the Electoral Commission which certifies and      declares the winner of presidential elections. It seems that      this election was not carried out in accordance with the      constitution of Cote d'Ivoire.       In addition, there is evidence of massive electoral fraud      in the rebel held north. I submitted this evidence in two      letters to Secretary Clinton and am awaiting a response to      these specific allegations.       I also submitted an electoral document showing official      regional electoral returns, where it shows Ouattara receiving      a total 149,598 from one of five northern cities. But when      the total is officially reported in the total vote column,      Ouattara receives 244,471; a difference of 94,873 votes!       The evidence submitted to Secretary Clinton includes      tallies of precincts where, in the first round of voting,      President Laurent Gbagbo received multiple thousands of      votes, but in the second round he received zero votes. That      is a statistical impossibility.       From all the evidence I now have gathered, I am convinced      that it is mathematically impossible for President Gbagbo to      have lost the election by several hundred thousand votes. And      if a similar amount of fraud exists in the other four regions      of the rebel-held north, Gbagbo is actually the winner of the      presidential election.     French say:       ``Since the results, former President Laurent Gbagbo has      not only refused to acknowledge the results, and listen to      the will of the people of Cote d'Ivoire, but actually      dismissed several initiatives, including by the AU, ECOWAS      and other African leaders, to avert any bloodshed and find a      peaceful solution of the crisis. Most recently, he again      refused to accept proposals by the AU High Level Group, while      these proposals have been formally accepted by President      Ouattara.''     Inhofe responds:       Not true. As late as March 27, the African Union sent      former Cape Verde foreign minister Jose Brito to mediate      between Ouattara and Gbagbo. Gbagbo accepted the mediation,      but Ouattara rejected it!     French say:       ``This deadlock has precipitated a deterioration of the      humanitarian situation. In addition, it has led to growing      violence, of which the first victims have been civilians, in      spite of the presence on the ground of the U.N. Operation in      Cote d'Ivoire (UNOCI). It is in this context that the United      Nations Security Council adopted its Resolution 1975 on March      30. This decision was adopted unanimously, including with a      positive vote from the United States and the three African      members of the Council (namely, Gabon, Nigeria and South      Africa). It stresses the protection of civilians, and the      need to prevent the use of heavy weapons in this regard, as a      key element of the impartial implementation of UNOCI's      mandate.''     Inhofe responds:       There is no evidence that President Gbagbo ordered the      shelling or killing of civilians in Abidjan or throughout the      country. He has repeatedly denied it, and it is in fact      actions by forces under the control of Ouattara who have      carried out military and terrorist actions. This consisted      of attacks upon police and Army forces by ``invisible      commandos'' and the outright offensive launched from the      north that has led to the present crisis.     French say:       ``In Cote d'Ivoire, French forces are acting on the basis      of an international mandate given by U.N. Security Council,      in support to the internationally constituted U.N.      peacekeeping operation (UNOCI).''     Inhofe responds:       Focus should be on the word ``peacekeeping''.      Unfortunately, the United Nations and French forces are not      engaging in peace-keeping, but war-making.     French say:       ``Most recently, their intervention has been strictly      consistent with Resolution 1975, and responded to a request      to President Sarkozy by UN Secretary-General Ban with a view      to support UNOCI as it enforces its mandate. In particular,      French forces' intervention in Abidjan has been strictly      consistent with this goal, and designed to neutralize the      heavy weapons used against civilian populations and UN      personnel in Abidjan.''     Inhofe responds:       Not true. Abidjan is a densely populated city of four      million people. In this urban environment, the collateral      damage caused by the attacks by UN and French attack      helicopters and ground troops has caused hundreds if not      thousands of civilian casualties. Specifically, hundreds of      youths supportive of President Gbagbo formed a human shield      around the presidential palace in an attempt to halt the      Ouaratta and French offensive. No one knows how many of these      youths have been killed by UN and French forces.     French say:       ``In the context of its commitment to the protection of      civilians and the fight against impunity in Cote d'Ivoire, as      in the rest of Africa and worldwide, France reiterated its      calls for an immediate halt to all violence against      civilians, and underscored that the perpetrators of these      crimes must be held accountable before a court of law. France      welcomes President Ouattara's pledge in this regard.''     Inhofe responds:       The only reported slaughter of civilians has been      perpetrated by Ouattara forces. This occurred in the western      town of Duekoue where up to 1000 people were massacred by the      Dozos, traditional hunters who fought alongside Ouattara      forces. This has been confirmed by the United Nations and      Human Rights Watch.     French say:       ``France is looking forward to the end of the current      violence, and hopes that the constitutional and democratic      order will eventually prevail. It is for president Ouattara      and the people of Cote d'Ivoire to find the political      solutions that will favor a democratic, peaceful, prosperous      and reconciled nation.''     Inhofe responds:       Not true. President Gbagbo has called for an immediate      cease-fire several times and has been ignored by Ouattara,      the UN and French forces. The killings can come to an      immediate end if these forces agree to a cease-fire.     Conclusion:       This past Wednesday, April 6, marked the 17th anniversary      of the 1994 Rwandan genocide. We now know that UN General      Secretary Koffi Annan and others knew of the extend of this      violence early on, but did nothing about it.       We all want to prevent another genocide from occurring.       That is why the United States must call for an immediate      ceasefire to prevent Ouattara and his rebel army from      committing more mass slaughters of the Ivoirians.       Lastly, I renew my request to Senate Foreign Relations      Committee Chairman Kerry requesting that he convene a hearing      as soon as possible into the atrocities committed by forces      loyal to rebel leader Ouattara, as well as into what I      believe were flawed elections that gave legitimacy to his      claim of the presidency.
