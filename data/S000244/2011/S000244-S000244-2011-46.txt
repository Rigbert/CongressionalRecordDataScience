 I plan on doing, with this reauthorization of the Patriot Act, the same thing I did with the 2005 reauthorization of the Patriot Act. Examine every one of the expiring provisions, let everybody speak their piece, and let the House of Representatives work its will.  There have been no civil liberties violations on these three expiring provisions. They have all been upheld as constitutional or not challenged. And we did have a problem with business records, and we solved that in 2005. So all of the fears that the gentleman from Colorado is making I think are a red herring. We did it when we were in the majority in the Judiciary Committee; and unfortunately, when the other side was in the majority, they didn't do it. That's why we are here today.
