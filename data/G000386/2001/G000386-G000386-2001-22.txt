 You are doing exactly what I said. I won't say anything, but I resent your saying that we are stalling on this side when I was here to offer an amendment even at this late date. You told me less than an hour ago, no more amendments. So have the record show that the Senator from Iowa, the senior Senator from Iowa, was ready to offer an amendment and go through a time.
