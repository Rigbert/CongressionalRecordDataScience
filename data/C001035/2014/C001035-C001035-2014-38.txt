President. Today I commemorate the 150th anniversary of the town of Mount Chase, ME. Mount Chase was built with a spirit of determination and resiliency that still guides the community today, and this is a time to celebrate the generations of hard-working and caring people who have made it such a wonderful place to live, work, and raise families.  While this sesquicentennial marks Mount Chase's incorporation, the year 1864 was but one milestone in a long journey of progress. For thousands of years, the land surrounding Mt. Katahdin, Maine's highest peak, was the hunting and fishing grounds of the Penobscot and Maliseet tribes. In the 1830s, the first white settlers were drawn by the fertile soil, vast stands of timber, and fast-moving streams, and the young village became a center of the Maine North Woods lumber industry. The wealth produced by the forests and saw mills was invested in schools and churches to create a true community. The incorporated town that followed was named for the prominent mountain peak, Mt. Chase, which towers more than a half-mile above the farms and forests below.  The arrival of the railroads in the aftermath of the Civil War further secured Mount Chase's prominence in the lumber industry, and the town was home to the largest cold-storage plant on the line for wild game and other perishable food products. By the end of the 19th century, modern transportation and the region's spectacular scenery and abundant wildlife combined to create a new economic opportunity--great sporting camps and lodges that drew outdoor enthusiasts from around the world. Today, the people of Mount Chase continue to honor the strong land use traditions and love of the outdoors that have helped make such places as Shin Pond a favorite recreation destination for residents and visitors.  In the early 20th century, the history, industry, and beauty of the Mount Chase region were made immortal by the great Swedish-born artist Carl Sprinchorn, who spent many years at Shin Pond. From his paintings of the strenuous daily life of lumberjacks to his evocative landscapes, the artist recorded a very special time in Maine history and a place that remains special today.  This 150th anniversary is not just about something that is measured in calendar years, it is about human accomplishment, an occasion to celebrate the people who for generations have pulled together, cared for one another, and built a community. Thanks to those who came before, Mount Chase has a wonderful history. Thanks to those who are there today, it has a bright future.                          ____________________
