Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I just want to point out to some of my friends on the other side of the issue, they may not be aware that the new figures for the 1995 immigration levels are in. The 1995 level was 715,000. Under this bill we average 700,000 each for the next 5 years. I might concede a 2-percent reduction at most.
