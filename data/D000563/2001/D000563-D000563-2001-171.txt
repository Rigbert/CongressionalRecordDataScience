President, today I am introducing legislation that would replace the current fragmented Federal food safety system with a single agency responsible for all Federal food safety activities, the Safe Food Act of 2001. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Torricelli, Mikulski, and Clinton in this important effort.  Make no mistake, our country has been blessed with one of the safest and most abundant food supplies in the world. However, we can do better. Foodborne illnesses and hazards are still a significant problem that cannot be passively dismissed.
