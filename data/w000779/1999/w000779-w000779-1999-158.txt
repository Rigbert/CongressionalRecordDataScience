 It seems to me that on the basis of everything we have gone through in terms of the committee, there is a reason that the high-tech community is overwhelmingly opposed to the Kerry amendment. As far as I can tell, there is this company the Senator from Massachusetts has talked about, and I will acknowledge that. But the high-tech community, as far as I can tell, is overwhelmingly opposed to this Kerry amendment. As far as I can tell, the reason they are is that the Kerry amendment introduces vague, ill-defined terms that are going to triggermore litigation. On the basis of everything we went through in the committee, is it the chairman's judgment that that is the reason the high-tech community is overwhelmingly opposed to the Kerry proposal now before the Senate?  Mr. McCAIN. That is my understanding.  Obviously, I would like to include the Senator from Massachusetts in this dialog. Under his amendment--and I will be glad to respond to his question--isn't it true that defendants who are in the middle of the supply chain may be sued for a breach of contract caused not by the failure of the defendant's computers but by those elsewhere in the supply chain? That is the fundamental problem we have with Senator Kerry's amendment.  I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.
