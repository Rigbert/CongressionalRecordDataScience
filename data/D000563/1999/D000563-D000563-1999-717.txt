President, if the Senator from Nevada will yield, I think it is interesting to step back for a second and look at what Congress does. We believe that because there is a problem of crime in America, we should Federalize a lot of crimes. Even the Chief Justice of the United States recently noted that if we continue this trend of Federalizing crime, we are going to dramatically change law enforcement in the United States. The enforcement of laws involving crime used to be a State and local responsibility. But because of our interest on Capitol Hill in crime, we continue to Federalize more and more crime. Yet, when it comes to prevention programs such as the one suggested by the Senator from Nevada, many people argue, ``Keep your hands off.'' If you want to prevent crime, it has to be done at the State and local basis.  I hope we can find a balance here.  As I traveled around Illinois, I found some extraordinary ideas coming out of local school districts about afterschool programs, bringing kids up to the reading levels in school, remedial activities, and the like. I want to express that.  I notice the Senator from Nevada was careful to say that he wanted to see this local creativity, that we were not going to send down a Federal rule book, a manual of instruction. We are looking for results. We want accountability. I think if we take that approach, we can build Federal programs that are welcomed at the local level, and not rejected.
