 President, I say to my colleague from Wyoming that Medicare drug plans and MedicareAdvantage organizations should not force seniors or the disabled to choose a mail-order house when they would prefer to patronize their local community pharmacy.  The Senator from Wyoming is correct in noting that the conference report permits plans to set a different charge to the beneficiary for a mail-order prescription versus a retail prescription. However, it is my expectation that any differential in charge be reasonable and based on the actual cost of providing the service in or through the setting in which it is provided. I also would expect that the Secretary of Health and Human Services would disapprove of any plan that would impose a differential charge that was intended primarily to steer Medicare beneficiaries to mail-order pharmacies versus retail pharmacies.
