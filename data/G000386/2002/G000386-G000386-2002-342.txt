 President, I refer to an article on page 6 of the Washington Post this morning where there is a quote from colleagues in this body and in the other body about the President's budget. I refer to this comment from the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, Congressman Spratt:       When it comes to waging a war on terrorism, the President      has our total support, but national security and homeland      security need not come at the expense of Social Security.  Philosophically, that is a good argument. It is an accurate argument for us to be using, but the inference is that with the President's new budget there is some sort of a new game in town, that because we do not have a general fund surplus, because we have to spend more money because of the war on terrorism, as well as the domestic aspect of the war on terrorism, we are going to take Social Security money to finance that because there is otherwise a debt. The implication is this is some new policy.  The point I make is that this kind of talk is misleading because seniors become frightened that they might not receive their Social Security payments. Conservatives may feel as if there is not any fiscal discipline in Washington. Compared to the last 4 years, we have paid down on the national debt in the last 4 years on a relative basis. But conservatives might be concerned that there is no concern about fiscal discipline when it comes to Social Security. But, in fact, there is no new policy in town.  The point I make is since Social Security was started in 1936, except for about 18 months in the years 1982 and 1983, it has had a positive cashflow, more money coming in from the Social Security payroll tax than has been paid out in benefits. As we anticipate that for the future, that will be true for another 14 years, or so.  So for people who read this statement by Congressman Spratt--and I quote: When it comes to waging war on terrorism, the President has our total support, but national security and homeland security need not come at the expense of Social Security--I say it is not coming at the expense of Social Security. Nothing has changed on Social Security since 1936. We have a positive cashflow today. We have had a positive cashflow every year except for 18 months in 1982 and 1983, and we will have a positive cashflow in Social Security for at least another 13 or 14 years. National security and homeland security are not coming at the expense of Social Security, I say to the distinguished Congressman in the other body.  Since we still have a positive cashflow in the year 2002, and we had a positive cashflow starting when the tax was first implemented, except for those 2 years, what happens with Social Security money? The disposition of Social Security money is the same today, last year, and years we have been running a surplus in the unified budget, and for a long time back. The surplus is invested in Treasury bonds because those are considered the safest investment for retirees. They draw interest. The interest accrues to the benefit of Social Security. That positive cashflow invested in Treasury bonds, plus the interest that is accrued, is going to be used to pay Social Security benefits when there is a negative cashflow in some future year. That is the way Social Security was set up. That is the way it has been operated since it was implemented in 1936. That is the way I believe it will be for a long time into the future.  National security and homeland security is not coming at the expense of Social Security. Let me give a parallel analysis. I will use the highway trust fund. In my State, it is the road use tax fund. At the Federal level it is the highway trust fund. All of the gas tax money goes into the highway trust fund. It is paid out of that highway trust fund for transportation, mostly for highways. It is not used for anything else. There are times, though, that the Federal Government decided they did not want to spend all the highway trust fund money. It was invested in Treasury bonds, as well. And it was not used to buy bombs and gunsand pay military pay. Over a period of years a lot of money accumulated.  In the last highway bill, Congress decided we ought to spend down that money that accumulated in the highway trust fund, and we spent it down. Not entirely, but we are spending it down. Consequently, if you can take that money that accumulated in the highway trust fund, that was not spent on roads on a current basis, but later was and is being spent for highways, it is exactly the same for Social Security. Moneys accumulate, with interest accruing to the trust fund, to be spent when it is needed, in the same way that the gas money, when it was not spent on highways, accumulated and later Congress decided we ought to spend more money on highways and we spent more money on highways.  It is one of the facts of trust fund accounting. The problem comes when we put Social Security in the context of a unified budget that it somehow gets lost in the public's mind. I assure the public that the implication of the statement by the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, Congressman Spratt, that the President's war on terrorism, the American people's war on terrorism could somehow be paid for by Social Security. In fact, it is not being financed by Social Security money.                          ____________________
