Madam Speaker, at the end of the 111th Congress, our distinguished colleague from Hanahan, South Carolina, the Honorable Henry E. Brown, Jr., will retire from this institution. Congressman Henry Brown has served the people of the 1st Congressional District, those living in South Carolina, and this nation with the highest distinction for the past twenty nine years.  His distinguished career in public service began on the Hanahan Planning Commission and City Council in 1981. Four years later, he was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives and he became the first Republican Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. In that capacity, just like President Ronald Reagan, he successfully led the fight for the largest tax cut in the history of the state. It has been his consistent view that the hardworking men and women of South Carolina deserve to keep more of their hard earned money and not the government.  After serving fifteen years in the South Carolina legislature, Henry Brown was overwhelmingly elected by the voters of the 1st Congressional District and for the past decade has served on the House Committees on Natural Resources, Transportation and Infrastructure and Veterans' Affairs. He has also served as the Co-Chairman of the Coastal Caucus, Congressional Friends of Canada Caucus, Congressional Shellfish Caucus and the Port Security Caucus.  For the past two Congresses, he has served as the Ranking Republican on the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Insular Affairs, Oceans and Wildlife. By working in a bipartisan manner with the Chairwoman of that Subcommittee, the Honorable Madeleine Z. Bordallo of Guam, Henry Brown was successful in having at least two of his legislative proposals enacted into law. These include H.R. 3891, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Act Amendments of 2008 and H.R. 1454, the Multinational Species Conservation Funds Semipostal Stamp Act of 2010. Congressman Brown remains hopeful that prior to adjournment this year, the Senate will adopt his bill, H.R. 509, the Marine Turtle Conservation Reauthorization Act which passed the House of Representatives last year.  While these represent just a few of the legislative proposals he has championed, his tireless dedication and leadership in sponsoring H.R. 1454 is an excellent example of why the people of the 1st Congressional District in South Carolina have come to know their Representative as a ``workhorse'' and not a ``show horse''.  Let me spend just a few minutes talking about H.R. 1454. This is a remarkable bill,which I was pleased to co-sponsor. At a time of record federal deficits, this proposal will raise a significant amount of money to save some of the most beloved and endangered iconic wildlife species on this planet without spending a single dime of taxpayer money. In addition, while the 111th Congress will be remembered for its highly partisan environment, this bill was co-sponsored by 86 Democrats and 68 Republicans. Even more remarkable, it has been endorsed by more than 40 different organizations including the Humane Society of the United States and Safari Club International, two groups that do not agree on many issues.  Under this simple but innovative approach, the American people will be given the opportunity to voluntarily purchase U.S. postal stamps and certain proceeds from their sale will assist in saving African and Asian elephants, rhinoceros, tigers, Great Apes and marine turtles for future generations. This legislation is a tribute to Congressman Brown's perseverance and leadership.  During his distinguished career in public service, the hard work of Congressman Henry Brown has not gone unnoticed. In fact, among the awards he has received are the College of Charleston's Founders Medal in 2005, the National Republican Legislator of the Year Award, the South Carolina Association of Realtors Legislator of the Year, the South Carolina Taxpayers Watchdog Award and the Order of the Palmetto in 2000. This award is the highest honor a civilian can receive from the State of South Carolina.  Madam Speaker, at the end of this year, this outstanding representative of the people of the 1st Congressional District will return to his beloved farm in Berkeley County, South Carolina. I wish him and his entire family the very best in the future.                          ____________________
