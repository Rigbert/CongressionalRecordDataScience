Chairman, I thank my friend, and I thank the gentleman from New York as well. He and I have talked about this amendment.  I am a very strong supporter of the COPS program, I have been and continue to be a very strong supporter of the COPS program. And what the gentleman's amendment does is dramatically point out that the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Serrano) do not have sufficient funds to properly reach the levels that would be appropriate for funding for some very, very worthwhile programs.  On the other hand, when you are in this position, obviously you have to make choices. If you are going to have a zero sum game, that is, add no additional dollars, which would not be allowed, you have to take from some place if you want to increase in another place. The problem with this amendment, as I have told my friend from New York, is not its objective, which is an excellent one, but it is the means that it employs to attain that objective, which will have very serious adverse results, in my opinion.  Now, the gentleman has indicated that he is confident it will have no adverse effect on employment levels. I think that is not the case. It is not the information I have. Now, as I have told the gentleman, obviously, I, as a matter of fact, went to high school a mile down the road from the Census Bureau, so I know something about the Census Bureau. It will, according to the Census Bureau, result in possibly as many as 1,000 RIFs. Now, that is a lot of people.  Now, in addition to adversely affecting the people, the gentleman's amendment will affect the product adversely. Now, what is the product? The product is getting ready for the census of 2010. Now, that sounds very simple, but in fact it is a multiyear process. And if you slow it down, you can never get back that time.                              {time}  1800  Therefore, although I strongly support the gentleman's objective, I cannot support and will therefore oppose his amendment, the means he employs to obtain that objective. I hope this amendment is defeated not because we should not be expanding the COPS program, but because we should not be doing it in this particular way.
