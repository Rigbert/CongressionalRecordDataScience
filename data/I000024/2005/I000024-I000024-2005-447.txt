President, Senator Harkin and I are introducing the True Competition Act which will resolve a longstanding debate about the status of Dallas Love Field Airport. This is a critical issue for those of us from States that depend on access to the Nation's air transportation network through hub airports in other States.  In the late 1960s the Federal Government expressed concern that it was funding three airports very closely located to each other in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. It asked the local communities to build a single major airport to serve the entire region. The cities of Dallas and Fort Worth, in consultation with the airlines serving the local airports, agreed to do so only under the condition that all three local airports be permanently closed to all commercial airline traffic. It was this agreement that resulted in the construction of the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.  The legislation I propose today would return to the original intent of all the parties involved in the decision to build DFW International by closing Love Field to commercial air traffic. If enacted, competition at DFW will increase significantly. This will be good for consumers and it will be good for communities that used DFW as their access to the world.  The Federal statute that is central to this debate is the so-called Wright amendment. This was a law enacted in 1979 that allowed Love Field to stayopen for limited service despite the desire of the local communities to have it close. It was necessary because activist judges in Texas had ruled against the local government's intent to consolidate all air traffic at DFW.  Recently, legislation has been introduced that would completely reverse the agreement of the parties to limit Love Field to an airport serving short haul markets. This would return to the situation that was supposed be corrected 30 years ago. The runways of Love Field and DFW are 8 miles apart. To have two major, federally funded airports so close simply doesn't make sense.  Moreover, if flights are transferred from DFW to Love Field--as they surely would be if the Wright amendment is repealed--there will be fewer connecting opportunities at DFW for passengers from outside the north Texas area.  I understand that Southwest Airlines is lobbying strongly for repeal of the Wright amendment. I want to make it clear that I have the greatest respect for Southwest and consider myself a good customer. But Southwest surely does not need the continued permanent home court advantage that the courts gave them years ago. Southwest operates very successfully at some of the most congested and high volume airports in the country. They have the skill and the resources to compete against any carrier at any airport. If they moved their operations to DFW, consumers and communities could have the best of all worlds--intense head-to-head competition between carriers and even more opportunities to travel throughout the world.  It is time to resolve this controversy once and for all by returning to the original intent of the parties.                                 ______                                       By
