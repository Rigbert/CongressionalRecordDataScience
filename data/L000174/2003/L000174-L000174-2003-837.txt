President, I rise today to join my good friend, the senior Senator from Utah, in introducing the PROTECT Act, a bill providing important new tools to fight child pornography. This bill is identical to the measure that Senator Hatch and I worked so hard on in the last Congress. The bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent in the 107th Congress and I am proud to be the lead cosponsor of this legislation for the 108th Congress as well, but unfortunately, it did not become law last year because, even though the Senate was still meeting, considering and passing legislation, the House of Representatives had adjourned. The House would not return to take action on this measure that had passed the Senate unanimously or to work out our differences.  I hope that the full Senate will quickly pass this bill again, and I strongly urge the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives to take this second opportunity to pass this important legislation. I also urge the Administration to support this bipartisan measure, instead of using this debate as an opportunity to push for legislation that strives to make an ideological statement, but which may not withstand Constitutional scrutiny.  I want to take a moment to speak about the history of this important bill and the effort that it took to get to this point. In May of 2002, I came to the Senate floor and joined Senator Hatch in introducing S. 2520, the PROTECT Act, after the Supreme Court's decision in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, (``Free Speech''). Although there were some others who raised constitutional concerns about specific provisions in that bill, I believed that unlike legislative language proposed by the Administration in the last Congress, it was a good faith effort to work within the First Amendment.  Everyone in the Senate agrees that we should do all we can to protect our children from being victimized by child pornography. That would be an easy debate and vote. The more difficult thing is to write a law that will both do that and will stick. In 1996, when we passed the Child Pornography Prevention Act, (``CPPA''), many warned us that certain provisions of that Act violated the First Amendment. The Supreme Court's recent decision in Free Speech has proven them correct.  We should not sit by and do nothing. It is important that we respond to the Supreme Court decision. It is just as important, however, that we avoid repeating our past mistakes. Unlike the 1996 CPPA, this time we should respond with a law that passes constitutional muster. Our children deserve more than a press conference on this issue. They deserve a law that will last.  It is important that we do all we can to end the victimization of real children by child pornographers, but it is also important that we pass a law that will withstand First Amendment scrutiny. We need a law with real teeth, not one with false teeth.  After joining Senator Hatch in introducing the PROTECT Act in the 107th Congress, as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee I convened a hearing on October 2, 2002 on the legislation. We heard from the Administration, from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, (``NCMEC''), and from experts who came and told us that our bill, as introduced, would pass constitutional muster, but the House-passed bill supported by the Administration would not.  I then placed S. 2520 on the Judiciary Committee's calendar for the October 8, 2002, business meeting. I continued to work with Senator Hatch to improve the bill so that it could be quickly enacted. Senator Hatch circulated a Hatch-Leahy proposed Judiciary Committee substitute that improved the bill before our October 8 business meeting. Unfortunately the Judiciary Committee was unable to consider it because of procedural maneuvering by my colleagues that had nothing to do with this important legislation, including the refusal of Committee members on the other side of the aisle to consider any pending legislation on the Committee's agenda.  I still wanted to get this bill done. That is why, for a full week in October, I worked to clear and have the full Senate pass a substitute to S. 2520 that tracked the Hatch-Leahy proposed committee substitute in nearly every area. Indeed, the substitute I offered even adopted parts of the House bill which would help the NCMEC work with local and state law enforcement on these cases. Twice, I spoke on the Senate floor imploring that we approve such legislation. As I stated then, every single Democratic Senator cleared that measure. I then urged Republicans to work on their side of the aisle to clear this measure--so similar to the joint Hatch-Leahy substitute--so that we could swiftly enact a law that would pass constitutional muster. Unfortunately, they did not. Facingthe recess before the mid-term elections, we were stymied again.  Even after the last election, however, during our lame duck session, I continued to work with Senator Hatch to pass this legislation through the Senate. As I had stated I would do prior to the election, I called a meeting of the Judiciary Committee on November 14, 2002. In the last meeting of the Judiciary Committee under my Chairmanship in the 107th Congress, I placed S. 2520, the Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act, on the agenda yet again. At that meeting the Judiciary Committee amended and approved this legislation. We agreed on a substitute and to improvements in the victim shield provision that I authored.  Although I did not agree with two of Senator Hatch's amendments, because I thought that they risked having the bill declared unconstitutional, I nevertheless called both for the Committee to approve the bill and voted for the bill in its amended form. I will discuss these provisions later.  I then sought, that same day, to gain the unanimous consent of the full Senate to pass S. 2520 as reported by the Judiciary Committee, and I worked with Senator Hatch to clear the bill on both sides of the aisle. I am pleased that the Senate did pass S. 2520 by unanimous consent. I want to thank Senator Hatch for all he did to help clear the bill for passage in the 107th Congress.  Unfortunately, the House failed to act on this measure last year and the Administration decided not to push for passage. If they had, we could have passed a bill, sent it to the President, and already had a new law on the books.  Instead, I am here again with Senator Hatch asking yet again that this bill be enacted. I am glad to have been able to work hand in hand with Senator Hatch on the PROTECT Act because it is a bill that gives prosecutors and investigators the tools they need to combat child pornography. The Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act strives to be a serious response to a serious problem.  The provisions of the Hatch-Leahy bill, as we introduce it, are bipartisan and good faith efforts to protect both our children and to honor the Constitution. At our hearing last October, Constitutional and criminal law scholars--one of whom was the same person who warned us last time that the CPPA would be struck down--stated that the PROTECT Act as introduced in the last Congress could withstand Constitutional scrutiny, although there were parts that were very close to the line. Let me outline some of the bill's important provisions:  I would like to emphasize some key provisions of the PROTECT Act. Section 3 of the bill creates two new crimes aimed at people who distribute child pornography and those who use such material to entice children to do illegal acts. Each of these new crimes carry a 15 year maximum prison sentence for a first offense and double that term for repeat offenders. First, the bill criminalizes the pandering of child pornography, creating a new crime to respond to the Supreme Court's recent ruling striking down the CPPA's definition of pandering. This provision is narrower than the old ``pandering'' definition for two reasons, both of which respond to specific Court criticisms: First, the new crime only applies to the people who actually pander the child pornography or solicit it, not to all those who possess the material ``downstream.''  The bill also contains a directive to the Sentencing Commission which asks them to distinguish between those who pander or distribute such material who are more culpable than those who solicit the material. Second, the pandering in this provision must be linked to ``obscene'' material, which is totally unprotected speech under Miller. Thus, while I would have liked for the provision to be crafted more narrowly so that ``purported'' material was not included, and I acknowledge that this provision may well be challenged on some of the same grounds as the prior CPPA provision, it responds to some specific concerns raised by the Supreme Court and is significantly narrower than the CPPA's definition of pandering.  Second, the bill creates a new crime to take direct aim at one of the chief evils of child pornography: namely, its use by sexual predators to entice minors either to engage in sexual activity or the production of more child pornography. This was one of the compelling arguments made by the government before the Supreme Court in support of the CPPA, but the Court rejected that argument as an insufficient basis to ban the production, distribution or possession of ``virtual'' child pornography. This bill addresses that same harm in a more targeted manner. It creates a new felony, which applies to both actual and virtual child pornography, for people who use such material to entice minors to participate in illegal activity. This will provide prosecutors a potent new tool to put away those who prey upon children using such pornography--whether the child pornography is virtual or not.  Next, this bill attempts to revamp the existing affirmative defense in child pornography cases both in response to criticisms of the Supreme Court and so that the defense does not erect unfair hurdles to the prosecution of cases involving real children. Responding directly to criticisms of the Court, the new affirmative defense applies equally to those who are charged with possessing child pornography and to those who actually produce it, a change from current law. It also allows, again responding to specific Supreme Court criticisms, for a defense that no actual children were used in the production of the child pornography--i.e. that it was made using computers. At the same time, this provision protects prosecutors from unfair surprise in the use of this affirmative defense by requiring that a defendant give advance notice of his intent to assert it, just as defendants are currently required to give if they plan to assert an alibi or insanity defense. As a former prosecutor I suggested this provision because it effects the real way that these important trials are conducted. With the provision, the government can marshal the expert testimony that may be needed to rebut this ``virtual porn'' defense in cases where real children were victimized.  This improved affirmative defense provides important support for the constitutionality of much of this bill after the Free Speech decision. Even Justice Thomas specifically wrote that it would be a key factor for him. This is one reason for making the defense applicable to all non-obscene, child pornography, as defined in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2256. In the bill's current form, however, the affirmative defense is not available in one of the new proposed classes of virtual child pornography, which would be found at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2256(8)(D). This omission may render that provision unconstitutional under the First Amendment, and I hope that, as the legislative process continues, we can work with constitutional experts to improve the bill in this and other ways. I do not want to be here again in five years, after yet another Supreme Court decision striking this law down.  The bill also provides needed assistance to prosecutors in rebutting the virtual porn defense by removing a restriction on the use of records of performers portrayed in certain sexually explicit conduct that are required to be maintained under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2257, and expanding such records to cover computer images. These records, which will be helpful in proving that the material in question is not ``virtual'' child pornography, may be used in federal child pornography and obscenity prosecutions under this Act. The purpose of this provision is to protect real children from exploitation. It is important that prosecutors have access to this information in both child pornography and obscenity prosecutions, since the Supreme Court's recent decision has had the effect of narrowing the child pornography laws, making more likely that the general obscenity statutes will be important tools in protecting children from exploitation. In addition, the Act raises the penalties for not keeping accurate records, further deterring the exploitation of minors and enhancing the reliability of the records.  Next, this bill contains several provisions altering the definition of ``child pornography'' in response to the Free Speech case. One approach would have been simply to add an ``obscenity'' requirement to the child pornography definitions. Outlawing all obscene child pornography real and virtual; minor and `youthful-adult;' simulated andreal--would clearly pass a constitutional challenge because obscene speech enjoys no protection at all. Under the Miller obscenity test, such material (1) ``appeals to the prurient interest,'' (2) is utterly ``offensive'' in any ``community,'' and (3) has absolutely no ``literary, artistic or scientific value.''  Some new provisions of this bill do take this ``obscenity'' approach, like the new Sec.  2256(8)(B). Other provisions, however, take a different approach. Specifically, the CPPA's definition of ``identifiable minor'' has been modified in the bill to include a prong for persons who are ``virtually indistinguishable from an actual minor.'' This adopts language from Justice O'Connor's concurrence in the Free Speech case. Thus, while this language is defensible, I predict that this provision will be the center of much constitutional debate. Although I will explain in more detail later, these new definitional provisions risk crossing the constitutional line.  It does not do America's children any good to write a law that might get struck down by our courts in order to prove an ideological point. These provisions should be fully debated and examined during the legislative process, and I will speak about them in more detail later.  The bill also contains a variety of other measures designed to increase jail sentences in cases where children are victimized by sexual predators. First, it enhances penalties for repeat offenders of child sex offenses by expanding the predicate crimes which trigger tough, mandatory minimum sentences. Second, the bill requires the U.S. Sentencing Commission to address a disturbing disparity in the current Sentencing Guidelines. The current sentences for a person who actually travels across state lines to have sex with a child are not as high as for child pornography. The Commission needs to correct this oversight immediately, so that prosecutors can take these dangerous sexual predators off the street. These are all strong measures designed to protect children and increase prison sentences for child molesters and those who otherwise exploit children.  The Act also has several provisions designed to protect the children who are victims in these horrible cases. Privacy of the children must be paramount. It is important that they not be victimized yet again in the criminal process. This bill provides for the first time ever an explicit shield law that prohibits the name or other non physical identifying information of the child victim, other than the age or approximate age, from being admitted at any child pornography trial. It is also intended that judges will take appropriate steps to ensure that such information as the child's name, address or other identifying information not be publicly disclosed during the pretrial phase of the case or at sentencing. The bill also contains a provision requiring the judge to instruct the jury, upon request of the government, that no inference should be drawn against the United States because of information inadmissible under the new shield law.  The Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act also amends certain reporting provisions governing child pornography. Specifically, it allows federal authorities to report information they receive from the Center from Missing and Exploited Children, CMEC, to state and local police without a court order. In addition, the bill removes the restrictions under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, ECPA, for reporting the contents of, and information pertaining to, a subscriber of stored electronic communications to the CMEC when a mandatory child porn report is filed with the CMEC pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 13032. This change may invite federal, state or local authorities to circumvent all subpoena and court order requirements under ECPA and allow them to obtain subscriber emails and information by triggering the initial report to the CMEC themselves. To the extent that these changes in ECPA may have that unintended effect, as this bill is considered in the Judiciary Committee and on the floor, we should consider mechanisms to guard against subverting the safeguards in ECPA from government officials going on fishing expeditions for stored electronic communications under the rubric of child porn investigations.  I also must express my disappointment in a recent Government Accounting Office, GAO, report that criticizes the Department of Justice information sharing regulations related to the CMEC tip line. Evidently, due to outdated turf mentalities, the Attorney General's regulations exclude both the United States Secret Service and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service from direct access to important tip line information. That is totally unacceptable, especially in the post 9-11 world where the importance of information sharing is greater than ever. How can the Administration justify support of this bill, which allows state and local law enforcement officers such access, when they are simultaneously refusing to allow other federal law enforcement agencies access to the same information? I urge the Attorney General to end this unseemly turf battle and to issue regulations allowing both the Secret Service and the Postal Inspection Service, who both perform valuable work in investigating these cases, to have access to this important information so that they can better protect our nation's children.  This bill also provides for extraterritorial jurisdiction where a defendant induces a child to engage in sexually explicit conduct outside the United States for the purposes of producing child pornography which they intend to transport to the United States. The provision is crafted to require the intent of actual transport of the material into the United States, unlike the House bill from the last Congress, which criminalized even an intent to make such material ``accessible.'' Under that overly broad wording, any material posted on a web site internationally could be covered, whether or not it was ever intended that the material be downloaded in the United States.  Finally, the bill provides also a new private right of action for the victims of child pornography. This provision has teeth, including injunctive relief and punitive damages that will help to put those who produce child pornography out of business for good. I commend Senator Hatch for his leadership on this provision.  These provisions are important, practical tools to put child pornographers out of business for good and in jail where they belong.  As to the administration proposal, unfortunately legal experts could not also vouch for the constitutionality of the bill supported by the Administration in the last Congress, which seemed to challenge the Supreme Court's decision, rather than accommodate the restraints spelled out by the Supreme Court. That proposal and the associated House bill from the 107th Congress simply ignored the Supreme Court's decision, reflecting an ideological response rather than a carefully drawn bill that would stand up to scrutiny. Last year, I received letters from other Constitutional scholars and practitioners expressing the same conclusion, which I will place in the record with unanimous consent.  With regard to the potential constitutional issues and suggested improvements, as I mentioned previously, the PROTECT Act is a good faith effort to tackle this problem, but it is not perfect and I would like to see some additional changes to the bill. I hope that we can consider these as the process moves forward.  First, regarding the tip line, I would like to clarify that law enforcement agents cannot ``tickle the tip line'' to avoid the key protections of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. This may include clarifying 42 U.S.C. Sec. 13032 that the initial tip triggering the report may not be generated by the government's investigative agents themselves. A tip line to the CMEC is just that--a way for outsiders to report wrongdoing to the CMEC and the government, not for the government to generate a report to itself without following otherwise required lawful process.  Second, regarding the affirmative defense, I would like to ensure that there is an affirmative defense for the new category of child pornography and for all cases where a defendant can prove in court that a specific, non-obscene image was made using not any child but only actual, identifiable adults.  As a general matter, it is worth repeating that we could be avoiding all these problems were we to take the simple approach of outlawing ``obscene'' child pornography of all types,which we do in one new provision that I suggested. That approach would produce a law beyond any possible challenge. This approach is also supported by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which we all respect as the true expert in this field.  Following is an excerpt from the Center's answer to written questions submitted after our hearing, which I will place in the Record in its entirety:       Our view is that the vast majority (99-100%) of all child      pornography would be found to be obscene by most judges and      juries, even under a standard of beyond a reasonable doubt in      criminal cases. Even within the reasonable person under      community standards model, it is highly unlikely that any      community would not find child pornography obscene. . . .       In the post Free Speech decision legal climate, the      prosecution of child pornography under an obscenity approach      is a reasonable strategy and sound policy.  Thus, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the approach that is least likely to raise constitutional questions--using established obscenity law--is also an effective one. Because that is not the approach we have decided to use, I recognize that the PROTECT Act contains provisions about which some may have legitimate Constitutional questions.  Specifically, in addition to the provisions that I have already discussed, there were two amendments adopted in the Judiciary Committee in the last Congress to which I objected that are included in the bill as we introduce it today. I felt and still feel that these provisions needlessly risked a serious constitutional challenge to a bill that provided prosecutors the tools they needed to do their jobs. Let me discuss my opposition to these two amendments offered by my good friend Senator Hatch last Congress.  As to the expansion of the pandering provision, although I worked with Senator Hatch to write the new pandering provision in the PROTECT Act, I did not support Senator Hatch's amendment extending the provision to cover ``purported'' material, which criminalizes speech even when there is no underlying material at all--whether obscene or non-obscene, virtual or real, child or adult.  The pandering provision is an important tool for prosecutors to punish true child pornographers who for some technical reason are beyond the reach of the normal child porn distribution or production statutes. It is not meant to federally criminalize talking dirty over the internet or the telephone when the person never possesses any material at all. That is speech, and that goes too far.  The original pandering provision in S. 2520 was quite broad, and some argued that it presented constitutional problems as written, but I thought that prosecutors needed a strong tool, so I supported Senator Hatch on that current provision.  I was heartened that Professor Schauer of Harvard, a noted First Amendment expert, testified at our hearing that he thought that the original provision was Constitutional, barely. Unfortunately, Professor Schauer has since written to me stating that this new amendment to include ``purported'' material ``would push well over the constitutional edge a provision that is now up against the edge, but probably barely on the constitutional side of it.'' I will place that letter and other materials in the record with unanimous consent of the Senate.  Because this change endangers the entire pandering provision, because it is unwise, and because that section is already strong enough to prosecute those who peddle child pornography, I hope that we can debate the merits of that provision as the legislative process continues.  And as to the inclusion of 100 percent virtual child pornography in ``Identifiable Minor'' provision, a change to the definition of ``identifiable minor'' would expand the bill to cover ``virtual'' child pornography that is, 100 percent computer generated pictures not involving any real children. For that reason, it also presents constitutional problems. I objected to this amendment when it was added to the bill in the last Congress in Committee and I continue to have serious concerns with it now.  Senator Hatch and I agree that legislation in this area is important. But regardless of our personal views, any law must be within constitutional limits or it does no good at all. This change which would include all ``virtual child pornography'' in the definition of child pornography, in my view, crosses the constitutional line, however, and needlessly risks protracted litigation that could assist child pornographers in escaping punishment. I hope we can work to narrow this provision.  Although I joined Senator Hatch in introducing this bill, even when it was introduced last year I expressed concern over certain provisions. One such provision was the new definition of ``identifiable minor.'' When the bill was introduced, I noted that this provision might ``both confuse the statute unnecessarily and endanger the already upheld 'morphing' section of the CPPA.'' I said I was concerned that it ``could present both overbreadth and vagueness problems in a later constitutional challenge.''  The Supreme Court made it clear that we can only outlaw child pornography in two situations: No. 1, it is obscene, or No. 2, it involves real kids. That is the law as stated by the Supreme Court, whether or not we agree with it.  The original ``identifiable minor'' provision in the PROTECT Act may be used without any link to obscenity doctrine. Therefore, what saved the original version as introduced in the 107th Congress was that it applied to child porn made with real ``persons.'' The provision was designed to cover all sorts of images of real kids that are morphed or altered, but not something entirely made by computer, with no child involved. That is the provision as Senator Hatch and I introduced this bill last year.  The change adopted in the Judiciary Committee last year, however, redefined ``identifiable minor'' by creating a new category of pornography for any ``computer generated image that is virtually indistinguishable from an actual minor'' dislodged, in my view, that sole constitutional anchor. The new provision could be read to include images that never involved real children at all but were 100 percent computer generated.  That was never the goal of this provision and that was the reason it was constitutional. There are other provisions in the bill that deal with obscene virtual child pornography that I support. This provision was intended to ease the prosecutor's burden in cases where images of real children were cleverly altered to avoid prosecution.  I support the definition of ``identifiable minor'' as we originally wrote and introduced it last Congress. Because this new change seriously weakens the constitutional argument supporting this entire provision, I oppose it and I hope that we can work to further narrow this provision.  These provisions raise legitimate concerns, but in the interest of making progress I support consideration of the measure as introduced. I hope that we can work to debate these issues and improve it and produce a bill with the best chance of withstanding a constitutional challenge.  That is not everyone's view. Others evidently think it is more important to make an ideological statement than to write a law. A media report on this legislation at the end of the last Congress reported the wide consensus that the Hatch-Leahy bill was more likely than the House bill to withstand scrutiny, but quoted a Republican House member as stating: ``Even if it comes back to Congress three times we will have created better legislation.''  To me, that makes no sense. Why not create the ``better legislation'' right now for today's children, instead of inviting more years of litigation and putting at risk any convictions obtained in the interim period before the Supreme Court again reviews the constitutionality of Congress' effort to address this serious problem? That is what the PROTECT Act seeks to accomplish.  Even though this bill is not perfect, I am glad to stand with Senator Hatch to secure its approval by the Senate as I did in the last Congress.  As I have explained, I believe that this issue is so important that I have been willing to compromise and to support a measure even though I do not agree with each and every provision that it contains. That is how legislation is normally passed. I hope that the Administration and the House do not decide to play politics with this issuethis year as I fear they did at the close of the last Congress. I urge swift consideration and passage of this important bill aimed at protecting our nation's children.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters and materials to which I referred be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 October 17, 2002.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: Thank you for the opportunity to      express the views of the National Center for Missing and      Exploited Children on these critically important issues for      our nation's children. Your stewardship of the Committee's      tireless efforts to craft a statute that will withstand      constitutional scrutiny is wise and in the long-term best      interest of the nation. The National Center for Missing and      Exploited Children is grateful for your leadership on this      issue.       Please find below my response to your written questions      submitted on October 9, 2002, regarding the ``Stopping Child      Pornography: Protecting our Children and the Constitution.''       1. Our view is that the vast majority (99-100%) of all      child pornography would be found to be obscene by most judges      and juries, even under the standard of beyond a reasonable      doubt in criminal cases. Even within the reasonable person      under community standards model, it is highly unlikely that      any community would not find child pornography obscene.       There is a legitimate concern that the obscenity standard      does not fully recognize, and therefore punish the      exceptional harm to children inherent in child pornography.      This issue can be addressed by the enactment of tougher      sentencing provisions if the obscenity standard is      implemented in the law regarding child pornography. Moreover,      mere possession of obscene materials under current law in      most jurisdictions is not a criminal violation. If the      obscenity standard were implemented for child pornography the      legislative intent should be clear concerning punishment for      possession of child obscene pornography.       In the post--Free Speech decision legal climate the      prosecution of child pornography cases under an obscenity      approach is a reasonable strategy and sound policy.       2. Based on my experience all the images in actual criminal      cases meet the lawful definition of obscenity, irrespective      of what community you litigate the case. In my experience      there has never been a visual depiction of child pornography      that did not meet the constitutional requirements for      obscenity.       3. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children      fully supports the correction of this sentencing disparity      and welcomes the provision of additional tools for federal      judges to remove these predators from our communities. These      types of offenders belong to a demographic that is the      highest percentile in terms of recidivism than any other      single offender category.       4. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children      fully supports language that allows only ``non-government      sources'' to provide tips to the CyberTipline. The role of      the CyberTipline at the National Center for Missing and      Exploited Children is to provide tips received from the      public and Electronic Communication Services communities and      make them available to appropriate law enforcement agencies.      Due in part to the overwhelming success of the system and in      part to the tragedies of September 11, 2001, federal law      enforcement resources cannot address all of the legitimate      tips and leads received by the CyberTipline. Allowing the      National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and      appropriate federal agencies to forward this information to      state and local law enforcement while at the same time      addressing legitimate privacy concerns is fully supported.       5. The victim shield provision is an excellent and timely      policy initiative and one that is fully supported by the      National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. This      provision should allow the narrow exception to a general non-     disclosure clause that anticipates the need for law      enforcement and prosecutors to use the victim's photography      and other relevant information for the sole purpose of      verification and authentication of an actual child victim in      future cases. This exception would allow the successful      prosecution of other cases that may involve a particular      victim and still provide the protection against the      revictimization by the criminal justice system.       6. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children      fully supports extending the terms of authorized supervised      release in federal cases involving the exploitation of      minors. The evidence for extended supervision in such cases      is overwhelming. Without adequate treatment and continued      supervision, there is a significantly higher risk for re-     offending by this type of offender. Moreover, there is a      significant link between those offenders who possess child      pornography and those who sexually assault children. Please      see the attached studies that the National Center for Missing      and Exploited Children has produced on these issues.       Thank you again for the opportunity to address these      important issues. Should you need further input or assistance      please contact us at your convenience.

Senator Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington,          DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy: On October 2, 2002, I testified before      the Senate Judiciary Committee concerning S. 2520 and H.R.      4623. Each of these bills was drafted in response to Ashcroft      v. Free Speech Coalition, 122 S.Ct. 1389 (2002), in which the      Supreme Court threw out key provisions of the federal child      pornography laws. As I stated in my testimony, the new      sections contained in S. 2520 have been carefully tailored      with an eye towards satisfying the precise concerns      identified by the Supreme Court. Recently, Senator Hatch      offered an amendment in the nature of a substitute to S. 2520      (hereinafter ``the Hatch Substitute''). I have examined the      Hatch Substitute, and I believe that it contains a definition      of child pornography that is nearly identical to the      definition rejected by Free Speech Coalition. Therefore, the      Hatch Substitute is unlikely to survive constitutional      challenge in the federal courts, and the Committee should      decline to adopt it.       As you know, each of these bills contains some complicated      provisions, including especially their definition sections.      As you also know, this complexity is unavoidable, for the      Congress aims to intervene in and eliminate some of the      complex law enforcement problems created by the phenomenon of      virtual pornography. In the following comments, I will try to      state my concerns about the Hatch Substitute as concisely as      possible, while identifying the statutory nuances that are      likely to generate significant constitutional questions in      the event that the Hatch Substitute is enacted.       In Free Speech Coalition, the Supreme Court scrutinized      provisions of the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996      (``CPPA'') that were designed to eliminate obstacles to law      enforcement created by virtual child pornography. The      proliferation of virtual pornography has enabled child      pornographers to escape conviction by arguing that it is so      difficult to distinguish the virtual child from the real one      that (1) the government cannot carry its burden of proving      that the pornography was made using real children and/or (2)      the government cannot carry its burden of proving scienter      because the defenders believed that the images in their      possession depicted virtual children, rather than real ones.      In order to foreclose these arguments, the CPPA defined      ``child pornography'' broadly so that it extended not only to      a sexually-explicit image that had been produced using a real      minor, but also to an image that ``appears to be of a minor''      engaging in sexually-explicit conduct. Free Speech Coalition      rejected this definition on First Amendment grounds. The      Court reaffirmed the holding of New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S.      747 (1982), under which the government is free to regulate      sexually-explicit materials produced using real minors      without regard to the value of those materials. However, the      Court refused to extend the Ferber analysis to sexually-     explicit materials that only appear to depict minors. The      Court noticed that many mainstream movies, as well as works      of great artistic, literary, and scientific significance,      explore the sexuality of adolescents and children. Such      works, including ones that are sexually explicit, are      valuable in the eyes of the community, and, as long as      their production involves no real children, such works are      protected by the First Amendment against governmental      regulation.       In Free Speech Coalition, the Supreme Court expressly      considered and rejected a number of arguments made by the      Solicitor General on behalf of the CPPA definition. One of      these arguments was that the ``speech prohibited by the CPPA      is virtually indistinguishable from child pornography, which      may be banned without regard to whether it depicts works of      value.'' In his opinion for the Court, Justice Kennedy      explained that this argument fundamentally misconceived the      nature of the First Amendment inquiry. Materials that satisfy      the Ferber definition are regulable not because they are      necessarily without value; to the contrary, Ferber itself      recognized that some child pornography might have significant      value. Indeed, the Court there reasoned that the ban on the      use of actual children was permissible in part because      virtual images--by definition, images ``virtually      indistinguishable'' from child pornography--were an available      and lawful alternative. Hence, as Justice Kennedy put it:      ``Ferber, then, not only referred to the distinction between      actual and virtual child pornography, it relied on [the      distinction] as a reason supporting its holding. Ferber      provides no support for a statute that eliminates the      distinction and makes the alternative mode criminal as      well.''       S. 2520 aims to reform the CPPA in ways that are sensitive      to these First Amendment value judgments. By contrast, the      Hatch Substitute proposes that the Congress should reenact a      definition that is almost identical to the one that the      Supreme Court just rejected. In the Hatch Substitute, the      definition of child pornography would cover,     among other things, sexually-explicit materials whose      production involved the use of an ``identifiable minor.'' The      Hatch Substitute defines ``identifiable minor'' as including      a ``computer or computer generated image that is virtually      indistinguishable from an actual minor.'' As I explained      above, the Solicitor General suggested in Free Speech      Coalition that the First Amendment would be satisfied if the      Supreme Court limited the CPPA to depictions that are      ``virtually indistinguishable'' from child pornography, and      the Court rejected that interpretation. To put it mildly, it      is hard to imagine that the Supreme Court would be inclined      to view the Hatch Substitute as a good-faith legislative      response to Free Speech Coalition when all it does is reenact      a definition that the Court there expressly considered and      disapproved. You will notice that I here am paraphrasing the      definition provisions in the Hatch Substitute and omitting      some of their complexity. In particular, the Hatch Substitute      provides a further definition of the phrase ``virtually      indistinguishable,'' requiring that the quality of the      depiction be determined from the viewpoint of an ``ordinary      person'' and providing an exception for ``drawings, cartoons,      sculptures, or paintings.'' But neither the definition of      ``identifiable minor'' nor these refinements of ``virtually      indistinguishable'' are calculated to satisfy the concerns      raised in Free Speech Coalition. As Justice Kennedy explained      for the Court, an absolute ban on pornography made with real      children is compatible with First Amendment rights precisely      because computer-generated images are an available      alternative, and, yet, the Hatch Substitute proposes to      forbid the computer-generated alternative as well. Likewise,      an exception for cartoons and so forth is insensitive to the      Supreme Court's commitment to protect realistic portrayals of      child sexuality, a commitment that is clearly expressed in      the Court's recognition of the value of (among other things)      mainstream movies such as Traffic and American Beauty.       In this regard, you will notice that the Hatch Substitute      closely resembles some of the defective provisions of H.R.      4623, which would prohibit virtual child porn that is      ``indistinguishable'' from porn produced with real minors.      Unlike S. 2520, both H.R. 4623 and the Hatch Substitute seem      to embody a decision merely to endorse the unconstitutional      portions of the CPPA all over again. The Committee should      refuse to engage in such a futile and disrespectful exercise.      The law enforcement problems posed by virtual pornography are      not symbolic but real, and the Congress should make a real      effort to solve them. In my judgment, S. 2520 is a real      effort to solve them, and the Committee should use S. 2520 as      the basis for correcting the CPPA.       The Hatch Substitute contains additional innovations that      the Committee should study carefully. Because this letter      already is too long, I will allude to only one of them here.      The ``pandering'' provision set forth in the Hatch Substitute      contains some language that strikes me as being both vague      and unnecessarily broad, and the provision therefore is      likely to attract unfavorable attention in the federal      courts. The Hatch pandering provision would punish anyone who      ``advertises, promotes, presents, distributes, or solicits .      . . any material or purported material in a manner that      conveys the impression that the material or purported      material'' is child pornography. To be completely candid, I      am not sure that I understand what problems would be solved      by defining the items that may not be pandered so that they      include not only actual ``material,'' but also ``purported      material.'' I suppose that there might be cases where a      person offers to sell pornographic materials that do not      actually exist and that the person might make the offer in a      manner that violates the pandering prohibition. If that is      the problem that the drafters of the Hatch Substitute have in      mind, it seems that they might solve that problem more      cleanly by adding the word ``offers'' to the list of      forbidden conduct and deleting the reference to ``purported      material.'' (In other words, the provision would punish      anyone who ``advertises, offers, promotes, presents,      distributes, or solicits through the mails . . . any material      on a manner that conveys the impression that the material''      is child pornography.) If that is not the problem that the      Hatch Substitute has in mind, I would suggest that the      drafters identify the problem precisely and develop language      that is clearer and narrower than the phrase ``purported      material,'' for that ambiguous term is likely to generate      First Amendment concerns that otherwise could and should be      avoided.           Respectfully yours,                                                 Anne M. Coughlin,     Class of 1948 Research Professor of Law.                                  ____                                    Washington, DC, Oct. 11, 2002.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington,          DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy: I want to thank you for your efforts      to protect American children by filling the gap left by the      Supreme Court's decision to strike down the Child Pornography      Prevention Act. Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition dealt a      blow to those who appreciate the important role the federal      government must ply in protecting young people from those who      would exploit them. Your efforts to craft a bill, the PROTECT      Act, that will withstand Constitutional scrutiny deserves the      public's applause.       I would like to draw your attention to a similar, but      separate, matter that also reflects on the health and      security of our children in regards to pornography. Like the      Child Pornography Prevention Act, the Child Internet      Protection Act (CIPA), which was passed by the 106th      Congress, has been struck down by the federal judiciary. In      American Library Association, et al. v. United States of      America, et al, a District Court in Pennsylvania threw CIPA      out, arguing that its efforts to prevent children from      exposure to harmful material on school and library computers      amounted to a violation of the First Amendment. The Justice      Department has appealed that case to the Supreme Court, where      the lower court's decision will very likely be upheld.      Unfortunately, as Harvard Law School professor Frederick      Schauer testified at the hearing you recently held on CPPA,      ``constitutionally suspect legislation under existing Supreme      Court interpretation of the First Amendment, whatever we may      think of the wisdom and accuracy of those interpretations,      puts the process of [prosecution] . . . on hold while the . .      . courts proceed at their own pace.       I think we ought not wait for what will likely be a      disappointing conclusion. Rather, I hope you will lead an      effort to craft new legislation which (1) passes      Constitutional muster, and (2) better enables schools and      libraries to protect children from harmful images and      websites. Let me take a moment to delimit how exactly a new,      improved Children's Internet Protection Act would differ from      the bill passed by the 106th Congress.       First, a new bill should distinguish clearly between      measures affecting adults and minors. Though the title of the      legislation is the Children's Internet Protection Act, it      requires technology protection measures on all computers with      Internet access, regardless of the age of the patron using      each computer. If the aim is to protect minors, it is      unnecessary to put filters on every computer in a library.      This, of course, was one of the District Court's primary      concerns. I hope you will draft legislation requiring      separate computers for adults and minors. All those under 18      should be required to use filtered computers, unless      accompanied by a parent or teacher. Those over 18 should have      access to un-filtered computers in a separate area. I smaller      facilities, where only one computer is available, special      adult hours could be set during which the filter is disabled      and only adults may use the computer. The rest of the time a      filter would be in place.       Second, I would encourage you to incorporate language that      distinguishes children 12 and under from teenagers 13-18.      Teenagers have greater capacities to process information than      children, as well as different needs for information. In      recognition of this, I would hope that your new bill would      require different policies for children and teenagers, such      as providing different filter settings.       Third, I hope you will consider expanding the scope of your      bill to include provisions that protect minors from violent      images as well as sexual ones. I realize that limiting the      access of children to violent content poses a potentially      more difficult constitutional question, but based on the      weight of social science evidence showing the harm caused to      children by violence in the media, I believe that violence      must be included in any definition of content that is      ``harmful to children.''       To further explain the reasoning behind these      recommendations, I am enclosing a law review article, ``On      Protecting Children from Speech,'' which will be published      next fall in the Chicago-Kent Law Review. I would welcome the      opportunity to discuss our position with you further. In the      meantime, please feel free to contact Marc Dunkelman,      Assistant Director of the Communitarian Network, with any      questions. Thank you for your consideration.           Sincerely,                                                   Amitai Etzioni,     Founder & Director.                                  ____                                                     May 13, 2002.     Chairman Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy: We write to express our grave concern      with the legislation recently proposed by the Department of      Justice in response to the Supreme Court's decision in      Ashcroft, et al. v. The Free Speech Coalition, et al., No.      00-795 (Apr. 16, 2002). In particular, the proposed      legislation purports to ban speech that is neither obscene      nor unprotected child pornography (indeed, the bill expressly      targets images that do not involve real human beings at all).      Accordingly, in our view, it suffers from the same      infirmities that led the Court to invalidate the statute at      issue in Ashcroft.       We emphasize that we share the revulsion all Americans feel      toward those who harm children, and fully support legitimate      efforts to eradicate child pornography. As the Court in      Ashcroft emphasized, however, in doing so Congress must act      within the limits of the First Amendment. In our view, the      bill proposed by the Department of Justice fails to do so.           Respectfully submitted,     Jodie L. Kelley,       Partner, Jenner & Block, LLC, Washington, DC.

Kennedy School of Government,                                   Cambridge, MA, October 3, 2002.     Re S. 2520.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: Following up on my written statement      and on my oral testimony before the Committee on Wednesday,      October 2, 2002, the staff of the Committee has asked me to      comment on the constitutional implications of changing the      current version of S. 2520 to change the word ``material'' in      Section 2 of the bill (page 2, lines 17 and 19) to      ``purported material.''       In my opinion the change would push well over the      constitutional edge a provision that is now right up against      that edge, but probably barely on the constitutional side of      it.       As I explained in my statement and orally, the Supreme      Court has from the Ginzburg decision in 1966 to the Hamling      decision in 1973 to the Free Speech Coalition decision in      2002 consistently refused to accept that ``pandering'' may be      an independent offense, as opposed to being evidence of the      offense of obscenity (and, by implication, child      pornography). The basic premise of the pandering prohibition      in S. 2520 is thus in some tension with more than thirty-five      years of Supreme Court doctrine. What may save the provision,      however, is the fact that pandering may also be seen as      commercial advertisement, and the commercial advertisement of      an unlawful product or service is not protected by the      Supreme Court's commercial speech doctrine, as the Court made      clear in both Virginia Pharmacy and also in Pittsburgh Press      v. Human Relations Commission, 413 U.S. 376 (1973). It is      important to recognize, however, that this feature of      commercial speech doctrine does not apply to non-commercial      speech, where the description on advocacy of illegal acts is      fully protected unless under the narrow circumstances, not      applicable here, of immediate incitement.       The implication of this is that moving away from      communication that could be described as an actual commercial      advertisement decreases the availability of this approach to      defending Section 2 of S. 2520. Although it may appear as if      advertising ``material'' that does not exist at all      (``purported material'') makes little difference, there is a      substantial risk that the change moves the entire section      away from the straight commercial speech category into more      general description, conversation, and perhaps even advocacy.      Because the existing arguments for the constitutionality of      this provision are already difficult ones after Free Speech      Coalition, anything that makes this provision less like a      straight offer to engage in a commercial transaction      increases the degree of constitutional jeopardy. By including      ``purported'' in the relevant section, the pandering looks      less commercial, and thus less like commercial speech, and      thus less open to constitutional defense I outlined in my      written statement and oral testimony.       I hope that this is helpful.           Yours sincerely,                                                Frederick Schauer,         Frank Stanton Professor of the First Amendment.                          ____________________
