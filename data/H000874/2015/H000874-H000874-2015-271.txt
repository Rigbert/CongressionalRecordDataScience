Wouldn't it be wonderful to show to the American public that we come together not in a partisan way, but as Americans to make sure they are as safe and secure as we can make them? But, no, we have denigrated this debate to a political debate about a difference between the President and the Congress. Now, that is a significant debate to have, but not on this bill, not where we have consensus, not where the American security is at risk if we fail.  Two of the amendments are solely designed to undermine the executive actions President Obama took to address our broken immigration system. We think they are appropriate; you don't. That is fine. That is a political difference. Do not defeat consensus because we have differences on an unrelated issue.  You will say it is related because this is, after all, the agency that deals with immigration and border security. I get that.  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has again expired.
