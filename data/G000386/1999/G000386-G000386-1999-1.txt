  Mr. Chairman, section 1005 of that Act would have provided that the principles of section 482 should be used to determine whether transactions between tax-exempt organizations and related non-exempt entities give rise to unrelated business income tax. This provision was needed to insure that legitimate arms length transactions between these entities are not penalized.  Unfortunately, it appears that this session will end without our having another opportunity to once again enact this vitally needed protection for the tax exempt community. As a result, I would like to ask the distinguished Chairman whether he would agree that this provision should be included as a high priority in the first tax vehicle that we adopt in the second session.
