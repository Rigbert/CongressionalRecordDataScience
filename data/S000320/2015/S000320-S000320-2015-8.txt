 President, today I wish to recognize a distinguished and outstanding business leader, Mr. Jay S. Fishman, as he steps down as chief executive officer of The Travelers Companies on December 1, 2015.  I met Jay during my first term as chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. Jay reached out to the committee in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. After handling claims and helping people rebuild their homes and businesses, Jay was interested in shaping public policy for how this country handles natural catastrophes. He proposed many innovative and thoughtful ideas on how to protect policyholders and taxpayers from what he called ``the next big one.'' I then watched as Jay deftly managed his company during the financial crisis, not merely weathering the storm, but thriving while many of his competitors were seeking help from the government in the form of taxpayer bailouts. Jay never asked what the government could do to help Travelers; he always asked how Travelers could help us to develop better public policy based on the expertise that he and his colleagues could provide.  Jay will continue to serve Travelers as executive chairman as he contends with the challenges that come with the diagnosis of ALS. He has handled the diagnosis with great dignity and a steadfast resolve to engage, which will surprise no one who knows him. I know he will work relentlessly to promote research that will extend and eventually save lives of people who are stricken with this terrible disease.  I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to this exceptional man, a man who passionately engaged in business and public policy, who has led a truly remarkable career and left an indelible impact on those people who were lucky enough to work for him and with him during his long career.                          ____________________
