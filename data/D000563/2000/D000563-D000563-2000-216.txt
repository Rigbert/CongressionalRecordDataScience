I want to show a chart to the Senator from Oklahoma, and anyone else following this, that was not prepared by Citizens for Tax Justice. It was prepared by the Joint Committee on Taxation which is an official body that works for the U.S. Congress. It is bipartisan, as I understand it. They were asked to try to determine how much tax relief of the marriage penalty tax relief bill proposed by the Republicans would be going to certain income groups in America. It is starkly different than what the Senator from Oklahoma has said.  If he will take a look at the comparison between the Democratic plan in yellow and the Republican plan in red, he will see different income categories. There is a substantial difference in the tax relief available. In the lower income categories, we find substantial relief available for those making $20,000 a year--under the Democratic plan about $2,000; under the Republican plan about $500. At $30,000, it is substantial help--about $4,000 under the Democratic plan; about $800 under the Republican; At $50,000 a year in income, $1,900 in tax relief on the Democrat plan, $240 on the Republican.
