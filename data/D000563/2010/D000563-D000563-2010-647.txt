You are always welcome to come to Illinois, too.  Mr. McCAIN. And I have been there many times. It is obvious the Senator from Illinois, even though he has been there, has no conception of what the people who live in southern Arizona are suffering under with hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants and human smugglers and drug smuggling going through our State.  I am glad he is such an expert--he and the Senator from New Jersey--on the issue of the terrible problems that afflict our State and our need to try to get our borders secure, which every citizen has the right to expect.  I thank my colleague for yielding.                        Tribute to Shawn Whitman
