Once we got into the budget negotiations and the Republican leadership was faced with actually saying, no, we won't add additional teachers, we will not have additional cops on the beat to address the crime problem across America, they could not do it. They ended up saying we actually won because we got this so-called across-the-board cut of .37 percent.  I might say to the Senator from Nevada, as he well knows, this is entirely within the discretion of the President, so it is not across the board. He can decide which areas of Federal spending to reduce to reach this target.
