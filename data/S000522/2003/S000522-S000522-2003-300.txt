Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing H.R. 8659, the Reservists Burial Equity Act of 2003. I am pleased to have join me as sponsors of the bill Mr. Lane Evans, the Ranking Democrat of the Veterans' Affairs Committee; Mr. Henry Brown and Mr. Michael Michaud, the Chairman and Ranking Member, respectively, of the Subcommittee on Benefits; as well as Mr. Jeff Miller; Ms. Julia Carson; Ms. Berkley; Mr. Sherrod Brown; and Mr. John Shimkus. This legislation would update the eligibility rules for burial of reservists at Arlington National Cemetery. Similar legislation passed the House in the 107th Congress.  Current Army rules provide in-ground burial at Arlington National Cemetery to veterans who died on active duty, received one of the military services' highest awards for gallantry, were held as a prisoner of war, or retired from active duty military service. In addition, veterans who do not meet the current eligibility criteria but who served in a high Federal office are also eligible, as are the immediate family members of all veterans buried there.  It is wholly inequitable that a reservist who serves our Nation for a minimum of 20 years is ineligible for in-ground burial at Arlington National Cemetery because he or she had the misfortune to die prior to age 60. The most glaring example of this policy was brought to light following the death of Captain Charles Burlingame III, the pilot of the American Airlines jet that crashed into the Pentagon on September 11, 2001. Although he had retired from the Naval Reserves, he was only 51 years old at the time of his death. As such, he was not automatically eligible for burial at Arlington. Subsequently, the Secretary of theArmy granted a waiver and Capt. Burlingame was interred at Arlington in December 2001.  Similarly, I see no reason why a reservist's eligibility for burial at Arlington should be based on whether that person was or was not in training status when he or she died in the line of duty. In today's military, there is often no practical difference.  This bill would revise existing law by eliminating the requirement that retired reservists be in receipt of their retirement pay to be eligible for in-ground burial at Arlington. Reservists must be 60 years old to receive retirement pay; reservist retirees who fall into this category are often referred to as being in the ``grey zone.'' The bill would also make eligible for in-ground burial reservists who die in the line of duty during active or inactive training.  Mr. Speaker, in recent years, reservists have been increasingly called upon to participate on active duty for extended periods to support the national defense. As the recent actions in Afghanistan and Iraq clearly demonstrate, reservists play a major role in the modern total force concept--we are unable to go to war without mobilizing reservists right from the start. Let's pass this bill and truly honor those men and women who put their civilian lives on hold to serve in our Armed Forces on behalf of the United States of America.                          ____________________
