 Yesterday afternoon it was my good fortune to see at least part of the very historic game, a game between the Chicago Cubs and the Milwaukee Brewers, which will now be part of baseball history. It was a game attended by 40,846 fans at Wrigley Field, and several hundred of us on the rooftops and around the field watched and marveled. Not only was it a great baseball game with the Cubs' victory, but it was a historic game for a very important person. Any newspaper you picked up in Chicago, or Illinois, or perhaps across the country, this morning let everyone in on the fact that baseball history was made yesterday in Wrigley Field.  Paul Sullivan, a Tribune staff writer for the Chicago Tribune put it in lyric words that I would like to read:       With the shadows creeping over the right field vines, and      the crowd on its tiptoes, Sosa took hold of an Eric Plunk      fastball in the ninth inning and sent it screaming onto      Waveland Avenue for number 62, in the greatest home run chase      the game has ever seen.  I was happy to be there and to see home run 62. I am happy to represent the State which has in it such a fine man playing as Sammy Sosa. We are really blessed--those of us who follow baseball--to have this wonderful home run derby, and have two extraordinary individuals involved in it.  Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals also sent 62 home runs this year, eclipsing the record of Babe Ruth, as well as Roger Maris. It is good to know that Mark McGwire is a good person. He announced early in the season that he would be donating $1 million of his salary this year for those children who have been physically and sexually abused. He has a heart, and he has shown it many times.  Then there is Sammy Sosa, from the Dominican Republic.  If you will recall the scene last week when Mark McGwire was breaking the record to be the first to do so, there was Sammy Sosa in right field. He could not have been more supportive and more congratulatory. There is a true friendship between the men.  As Mark McGwire received all of this attention and adulation, Sammy was there to cheer him on. Yesterday, Sammy Sosa matched Mark McGwire with 62 home runs. He continued to praise him as a friend and hoped that they both had good luck in this home run derby in the remaining games.  It tells us a lot about baseball. It tells us a lot about these two men.  Sammy Sosa comes from particularly humble beginnings, starting off in the Dominican Republic. One of my favorite quotes during the course of the season is someone went to Sammy Sosa and said, ``Aren't you under a lot of stress because of this race for the home run title?'' And he said, ``You think this is stressful, earning a living as a shoeshine boy in the Dominican Republic is stressful.'' He put it all in perspective.  He has been gracious and friendly. He has been a true sportsman throughout this race. He deserves our praise and our cheers as well.  All of us watch anxiously for the closing games to see who ends up with the ultimate home run record.  For those of us who are fortunate to love the game and to be watching it closely in 1998, I want to say my hat is off to Mark McGwire and especially to Sammy Sosa, who yesterday with two towering home runs over left field and into Waveland Avenue, really brought Chicago to its feet, cheering this man and all that he stands for.  I am hoping now that they will continue this race to set the record and to put the great American pastime back on its feet. I think they have done a lot for it.  I wish them both the very best. I yield the floor.                          ____________________
