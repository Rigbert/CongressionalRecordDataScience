To say, on one hand, I am not against labor unions, I am just against collective bargaining rights, is to get to the heart of the issue.  Let me give you an illustration that makes my point.  After September 11, 2001, we discovered that most of the terrorists responsible for the World Trade Center were coming over the northern border of the United States from Canada. We said that we were going to beef up efforts at the border to check people coming in so that others did not come in to threaten the United States. This administration said it. The Border Patrol said it. And do you know what. We did not do it. Two Border Patrol agents came forward and testified before a committee of Congress that it was all talk, we weren't putting the resources and the manpower in the right place to protect America after September 11, 2001.  These were Federal employees, members of labor unions with collective bargaining rights. Do you know what happened to them, I ask the Senator from Texas? Do you have any idea? They were fired from their jobs for testifying before Congress, terminated from their employment. Of course, there was a hearing because they had collective bargaining rights, and these whistleblowers were restored to their positions.  If we are going to talk about what is at stake, let me tell you this.
