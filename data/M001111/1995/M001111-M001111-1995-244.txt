 President, I thank the Chair and the chairman of the committee who has worked diligently with me this afternoon. One of my main concerns regarding this proposal to export ANS relates to the supply of Alaskan crude to the Tosco refinery at Ferndale. As I understand it, Tosco has 3 years and 8 months remaining on a supply agreement with BP. I want assurance that BP will honor the contract.  I have asked BP to provide me with that assurance, and today I received a letter from the president of BP Oil Shipping Co., Steve Benz, promising to honor the existing contract with Tosco's refinery at Ferndale.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print a copy of the letter in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                             BP America, Inc.,                                                     May 16, 1995.     Hon. Patty Murray,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Murray: I am sensitive to your concerns      regarding the supply agreement for Alaska North Slope crude      oil that BP has with the TOSCO refinery at Ferndale,      Washington. While we are under a strict confidentiality      agreement with respect to the details of that arrangement, I      want to give you my assurance that BP will fully honor the      terms and conditions of our current supply agreement with      TOSCO for the Ferndale, Washington refinery. This guarantees      that BP will be a supplier of Alaska North Slope crude oil to      the TOSCO Ferndale refinery through 1998.       I hope that this letter satisfies any remaining concerns      you may have regarding security of supply to TOSCO.           Sincerely,                                                       Steve Benz,                                       President, BP Oil Shipping.
