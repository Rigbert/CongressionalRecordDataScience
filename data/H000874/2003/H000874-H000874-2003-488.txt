Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.  At some point in time perhaps we can discuss further the regular order. I observe only that it is my understanding there is a bill coming over from the Senate that will not be referred to committee, will not be subject to amendment, will be taken up and passed as the Senate passed it, and it is my understanding that will be done because of the view of the majority how important it is to pass that bill immediately. That is the partial birth abortion bill.  Am I correct that is the procedure which the majority intends to follow?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?
