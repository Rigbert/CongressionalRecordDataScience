Speaker, yesterday this House worked its will and rightfully defeated a flawed rule imposed by some members of the Republican leadership to restrict debate on the important women, infants and children's feeding program. Today those Members who refused to eliminate over 180,000 pregnant mothers, their low birth weight babies and children from their lifeline to nutrition will achieve a great victory. We will keep our promise to assure America's future by taking proper care of the children of today.  I personally want to thank those Republicans who heard our pleas and want to do what is right for America. I also want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Moakley] who worked so very hard in the Committee on Rules, the gentlewoman from New Jersey [Mrs. Roukema] for her leadership, the gentlewoman from Connecticut [Ms. DeLauro], the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Roemer], the gentleman from New York [Mr. Walsh] and the gentleman from New York [Mr. Forbes], and I want to thank the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon], the chairman of the Committee on Rules, for bringing a revised rule to the floor today.                          ____________________
