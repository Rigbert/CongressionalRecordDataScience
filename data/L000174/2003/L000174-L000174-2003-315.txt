Rangel which I earlier referenced.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                    The Rangel Law Firm, P.C.,                            Corpus Christi, TX, September 5, 2003.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles Schumer,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Schumer: Where was the      outrage from your Republican colleagues when Enrique Moreno      and I were denied the courtesy of a hearing on our      nominations? Where was their disappointment and cry for      diversity on the bench when I was compelled to submit the      enclosed letter withdrawing my nomination to the Fifth      Circuit? The American people deserve better.           Your truly,     Jorge C. Rangel.                                  ____                                              Jorge C. Rangel,                                                 October 22, 1998.     The President,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: Fifteen months ago, you nominated me to      the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. I      enthusiastically welcomed the nomination and eagerly awaited      a hearing before the Judiciary Committee of the United States      Senate to have my qualifications reviewed. I patiently waited      for months, but I never received a hearing. My nomination      died when the Senate adjourned yesterday.       Our judicial system depends on men and women of good will      who agree to serve when asked to do so. But, public service      asks too much when those of us who answer the call to service      are subjected to a confirmation process dominated by      interminable delays and inaction. Patience has its virtues,      but it also has its limits.       Many friends and colleagues have urged me to stay in the      process by requesting that my name be resubmitted to the      Senate next year. Even if you were to decide to renominate      me, I have no reason to believe that the Senate would act      promptly on the nomination. I am not willing to prolong the      continued uncertainty and state of limbo in which I find      myself. As a professional, I can no longer postpone important      decisions attendant to my law practice.       Therefore, I would ask that you not resubmit my nomination      next year. There is a season for everything, and the time has      come for my family to get on with our lives and for me to get      on with my work.       Thank you for your trust and confidence in nominating me to      the Fifth Circuit. I pray that you will continue to recognize      and honor the diversity that is America, so that, one day,      our great country can realize its full potential.           Yours truly,     Jorge C. Rangel.                          ____________________
