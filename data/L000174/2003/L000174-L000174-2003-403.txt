President, today I rise to introduce a bill to address the growing concern over the future of our Nation's Federal forest lands. The debate over the administration's proposed Healthy Forests Initiative indicates just how important these public lands are and calls for Congress to provide visionary leadership over the future of these lands. My bill, the Forestry and Community Assistance Act, strives to provide that vision through a balance of sound land stewardship and immediate active management to address the wildfire risk to communities and the forest health needs of our Federal and private forest lands.  The catastrophic fires that plague our western national forests and Bureau of Land Management lands are not a new phenomenon. Forest fires are part of the natural landscape. However, the intensity of these fires and the impacts of them on the urban interface due to past management decisions must be appropriately addressed. This a complex issue requiring prudent and deliberate thought, not rash reaction that cuts the public out from the debate over the future of their Federal lands.  The administration claims that over 190 million acres are in need of treatment. By its own admission, treating even a small fraction of these acres will take almost a decade. Most people believe it will be much longer and could cost billions of dollars. Unfortunately, we do not have the time or money to take the broad, unfocused approach the administration proposes in H.R. 1904.  We need to take a step back and work together on a bill that will target funding and projects first to help those communities at greatest risk from wildfires. My bill, the Forest and Community Assistance Act, will expedite fire threat reduction projects on high-risk forest lands nearby communities, private property, and municipal watersheds. It provides new authority for Federal land management agencies to enter into cooperative agreements with local and State government, homeowner associations, and local fire districts to plan and execute thinning projects across ownership boundaries.  It would do all of this without compromising environmental laws, the public input process, or judicial review. The administration, through H.R. 1904, is suggesting that they should be able to get around all of these. They are wrong. Those who we entrust with the management of our public lands should be held to the highest standards of accountability. To end the open dialog with the American public, remove objective oversight, and, when necessary, limit review of decisions by the judiciary is irresponsible. These are the American public's lands, not the lands of a small minority who want to bypass over 30 years of environmental laws and jurisprudence.  The administration continues to argue that these problems have been created by unnecessary analysis, appeals, and lawsuits. It still boggles the imagination that an agency with a $4.84 billion budget, such as the Forest Service, is brought to its knees by thirteen lawsuits as recently noted in a May 2003 General Accounting Office report.  Maybe the devil is in the details, but as a former States attorney and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, one of my greatest concerns with the House bill, H.R. 1904, is its encroachment into the judicial branch. H.R. 1904 not only interferes with how the courts should manage their dockets, but it further tips the scales of justice in favor of the government. This is not the appropriate role of this Congress or of the executive branch. As noted, by my good colleague from Alaska, Senator Stevens, in a debate last week on another bill, ``the separation of powers is one of the most distinct advantages of this democracy. It is the longest living government on the face of the Earth today because it is a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, but it has a Constitution. That Constitution we all swear to uphold and defend. Part of that Constitution is the separation of powers concept.'' H.R. 1904 violates that concept.  The Forestry and Community Assistance Act of 2003 allows for public involvement, requires compliance with environmental laws, and allows for judicial review, while allowing work to be completed in an expedited manner. Further, my bill works towards addressing the health of our Nation's Federal lands by placing an emphasis on addressing the large-scale insect and disease epidemics that are harbingers of an unhealthy forest. The bill would also conserve lands in a healthy forest reserve program to provide protection for species at risk. Lastly, but not of least significance, the Forestry and Community Assistance Act focuses on providing economic and technical assistance to rural communities that depend on this Nation's natural resources for a living.  I hope that my colleagues will take a very close look at H.R. 1904 and recognize that it goes much further than its claims of addressing wildfire. I hope my colleagues will recognize that we need to take a different approach.                                 ______                                       By
