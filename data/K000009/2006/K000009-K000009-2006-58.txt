Chairman, I rise in very strong support of the renewal of the Voting Rights Act.  Unfortunately, this great American struggle is not over. We have seen voters denied their rights in recent elections as they have been incorrectly purged from lists, their absentee votes not counted, and voting machine integrity and security not assured.  Ohioans have raised countless questions about today's new electronic voting systems, their flawed security, their lack of transparency, their reliability and, yes, their very integrity. Who controls the security codes in these machines? How do we ensure that local boards of election and judges at the precinct level are empowered to properly count votes and not the voting machine companies who know more about those machines and how to program them than the people conducting the elections themselves?  Strong efforts have been made in Ohio to curb the authoritarianism of our Secretary of State, KennethBlackwell, as he has purged people from lists in our State in particular precincts where voters are heavily minority.  Mr. Chairman, we must pass the Voting Rights Act in its stronger form. The struggle is not over. As Reverend Joseph Lowery reminds us, keep hope alive, extend the Voting Rights Act.  I am in strong support of the passage of the Voting Rights Act to protect the ability of all citizens, particularly minorities, to vote. Unfortunately, this struggle is not over. We have seen voters denied their rights in several recent elections as voters have been incorrectly purged from lists, their absentee votes not counted, and voting machine integrity not assured.  Ohioans have raised countless questions about today's new electronic voting systems, their flawed security, their lack of transparency, their reliability, and yes, their very integrity. Who controls the security code for the machines? How do we assure that local Boards of Elections and judges at the precinct level are empowered to properly count votes and not the voting machine companies who know more about those machines and how to program them than the people conducting the elections.  Strong efforts were made by Ohio's Legislature to mandate voter verifiable paper trails on election machines, over the objections of Ohio's Secretary of State Kenneth Blackwell. Chairing the Bush campaign in Ohio, he opposed this standard. Blackwell also steered and limited the voting machine vendors from which local election authorities could choose, and imposed voter registration standards that were confusing and ridiculous. Voters of Ohio ended up challenging his capricious rulings in federal court on the day of the last Presidential election. He even tried to inject more confusion into the process by specifying the ``weight of paper'' used for voter registration forms when his own office was not using that kind of paper. His goal was clear: to create more confusion on election day by churning the electorate in key precincts to diminish turnout.  Congress passed the Help America Vote Act following the 2000 elections to fix these kinds of heavy-handed tactics and the mess America witnessed with the hanging chad ballots in Florida. Unfortunately, the bill did not mandate standards for the new equipment. To this day, and I believe purposefully by the Republican majority, no federal agency assures standards for voting technology on which localities can depend.  Voting rights stand at the top of our liberty pillar. We must pass this Voting Rights Act in its strongest form and restore America's trust in elections by ensuring their legitimacy and making them tamper-proof.  Mr. Chairman, before closing I would like to repeat a call that has been made by countless leaders of the civil rights movement including the Reverend Joseph Lowery, ``Keep hope alive: Extend the Voting Rights Act.''                [From the New York Times, July 7, 2006]                 Don't Dismantle the Voting Rights Act            (By Luci Baines Johnson and Lynda Johnson Robb)       The Voting Rights Act, signed into law on Aug. 6, 1965, by      our father, President Lyndon Johnson, opened the political      process to millions of Americans. The law was born amid the      struggle for voting rights in Selma and Montgomery, Ala.,      which the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. called ``a shining      moment in the conscience of man.'' By eliminating barriers,      including poll taxes and literacy tests, that had long      prevented members of minority groups from voting, the act      became a keystone of civil rights in the United States.       Now, crucial provisions of this legislation are in      jeopardy. Last month, Congress seemed set to renew expiring      sections intended to prevent voter discrimination based on      race or language proficiency. Instead, a group of House      lawmakers opposed to those sections succeeded in derailing      their considerations.       The Voting Rights Act prohibits discrimination in voting      everywhere in the country. But it has a special provision,      Section 5, intended for regions with persistent histories of      discrimination. These states and localities must have their      election plans approved by the Justice Department.       Since the act was last renewed, in 1982, the federal      government has objected to hundreds of proposed changes in      state and local voting laws on the basis of their      discriminatory impact. In recent years, proposed election      changes in Georgia, Texas and other states were blocked      because they violated the act.       Yet states and localities are not subject to Section 5      forever. In order to gain exemption, they need only meet a      set of clear standards proving that they have been in      compliance with the law for 10 years and have not tried to      discriminate against minority voters. In Virginia, for      example, eight counties and three cities have been exempted      from Section 5.       Another section of the act, Section 203, which Congress      added in 1975, mandates language assistance in certain      jurisdictions to promote voting by citizens with limited      proficiency in English. There are now 466 such jurisdictions      in 31 states.       No one disputes that our nation has come a long way since      the Voting Rights Act was first signed into law. But while it      would be nice to think we don't need this legislation      anymore, we do. We still struggle with the legacy of      institutionalized racism. If either of the act's two sections      under attack is weakened or allowed to expire, the door will      be opened to a new round of discriminatory practices.       The reauthorization stalled in Congress is called the      Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks and Coretta Scott King Voting      Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006. Were      he alive today, we believe President Johnson would be honored      to have this bill named after such remarkable women. Its      passage would be a fitting tribute to their collective      efforts to expand the scope of civil rights and citizenship.       In his own era, our father faced powerful opposition to the      Voting Rights Act, including from members of his own party.      Nonetheless, he pushed forward with the legislation because      he knew it was desperately needed. It was the right thing to      do then. It still is.
