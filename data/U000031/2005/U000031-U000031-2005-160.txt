Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Jay Van Den Berg, a distinguished community leader in Southwest Michigan for the past 30 years. Today, leaders from throughout the community are gathering at Michigan Works, to honor Jay's accomplishments and pay homage to a job well done as he is retiring from his numerous leadership posts.  Jay started his career as a teacher, selflessly giving all he had to each of his students, before moving on to a long, industrious career as an executive with the Whirlpool Corporation. Although he was working in the private sector, Jay utilized his leadership to promote academic achievement and excellence in our schools across the region, netting him more than a dozen state and national education awards.  Jay was a tireless advocate for bringing business and education together to create a stronger community. He could always be seen serving in leadership positions throughout Southwest Michigan whether it was with the Business Roundtable, Michigan Business Leaders for Education Excellence, The Michigan Works Workforce Development Board and many many others.  Through Jay's valiant leadership, the HOSTS mentoring program was established in Benton Harbor, and since then hundreds of students improved their reading scores and have been given the opportunity to succeed in school, as well as in life. His tireless work with the career preparation systems in Berrien, Van Buren and Cass Counties have become a national model and have enabled our young students to raise their test scores, allowing them to seek post-secondary education. These are just 2 of the examples of Jay's great work with the young people of our community.  Education plays such an important role in the lives of our young people, and it is because of people like Jay Van Den Berg, that many have had the opportunity to succeed. I stand today, with the folks of the great sixth district of Michigan, to give a heartfelt ``thank you'' to Jay, and wish him a long and enjoyable retirement.                          ____________________
