President, this week my colleagues, Senators Kyl, Kennedy and Hutchinson, and I have introduced S. 449, the Patient Right to Know Act of 1997. This legislation outlaws so-called gags in contracts between managed care companies and their licensed practitioners which have limited what doctors can tell patients about their medical condition and all treatment appropriate to their care.  Plain and simple, such gags have been used to limit appropriate medical care. While this is a dollars-and-cents issue for health care organizations and insurers, for patients and their doctorssuch restrictions on the usual free flow of communication--held sacred since ancient times--literally may be a matter of life or death.  I was pleased to join Mr. Kennedy in offering legislation on the floor last session which would have ended such restrictions. I also wish to thank Mr. Kyl for his support of our legislation last year, and for his diligent efforts in the intervening months to prepare this bill for re-introduction.  I also wish to acknowledge support for this legislation from organizations including the Consumer's Union and the American Medical Association.  We have this broad range of support because the need for this legislation is clear and documented. Three in four Americans now covered by private health insurance receive their care from managed care organizations. Increasingly, Medicaid enrollees and seniors in Medicare are covered by managed care plans through their respective Federal health insurance programs.  Residents of my home State of Oregon boast the highest penetration of managed care in the Nation. The State's Medicaid Program for the most part is organized through private managed care companies. And in Portland, managed care plans service almost 60 percent of the Medicare population.  In Oregon and elsewhere, the managed care presence has grown for reasons that are quite wholesome. Managed care helps enrollees stay healthy through illness prevention programs. They assure coordination of services for persons with multiple ailments. And through systematic, quality-conscious gate-keeping, they work to reduce unnecessary treatments which drive up health care costs.  At the same time, however, some managed care providers have tried to enhance their profit margins by limiting what doctors may tell patients regarding all appropriate treatments, thereby reducing services patients may actually receive. These gags in my view are outrageous. The President through administrative order during the last few months has made such gags illegal in managed care plans operating under Medicare and Medicaid. He has pledged his support for legislation eliminating these restrictions in private health plans as well.  Mr. President, while I am convinced that we need a single Federal standard on this matter to protect patients in managed care plans I am much encouraged by the voluntary efforts to end such gags recently announced by the managed care insurance industry. My long association with these companies has convinced me that coordinated care providers as a group often are on the cutting edge of developing both efficient and high-quality care for their enrollees. It is entirely appropriate for this provider group to try to police their members on the issue of gag provisions and the protection of doctor-patient communications.  I ask that the text of the bill be printed in today's Record.  The bill follows:                                 S. 449       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Patient      Right to Know Act''.

(6) The offering and operation of health plans affect      commerce among the States.       (c) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to establish a      Federal standard that protects medical communications between      health care providers and patients.     SEC. 2.
