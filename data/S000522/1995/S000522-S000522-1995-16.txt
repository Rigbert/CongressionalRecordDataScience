Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1833, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.  Many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will attempt to frame this debate in terms of a woman's right to choose. But the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act is not about women, choice, or reproductive rights. The true issue that this legislation addresses is the brutal late-term abortion procedure called partial-birth abortion.  Regardless of whether or not one believes that life begins at conception, a partial-birth abortion, which can be performed at any time following the 5-month period, is clearly the taking of an innocent human life. A baby is developed enough at 5-months to be able to live outside of the womb and there are many instances of infants being born prematurely at 5 months and surviving to live a full life.  The partial-birth abortion procedure should be prohibited. I heartily support this effort to protect the sanctity of human life.
