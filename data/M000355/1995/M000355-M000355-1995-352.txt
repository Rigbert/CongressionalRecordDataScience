 President, nobody can charge that this amendment is an attempt to preserve the status quo. Instead, it is an effort to preserve an essential Federal program by making some very tough but necessary choices.  In order to provide the necessary budget offset, I have proposed a reasonable reduction in the regulation and technology account of the Office of Surface Mining. The regulatory arm of OSM has served its statutory purposes well over the years, but the fact is that much of its current activities are now being handled effectively at the State level.  In fact, primary responsibility for regulation in this area has been passed on to 23 of the 26 coal-producing States.  Further, the size of the industry being regulated by OSM has shrunk dramatically over the last decade and a half. While the number of active coal mines has dropped from over 6,000 in 1979 to barely 3,000 in 1993, OSM staff has increased by more than 50 percent. Even since 1983, when the last of the 23 States assumed primary regulatory authority, OSM staff grew by a quarter.  About half of the OSM budget for regulation and technology funds activities that duplicate existing state resources.  So what you have here is a smaller industry--smaller by half--being regulated by 50 percent more bureaucrats. That is the kind of anomaly that our constituents want us to change.  Voters believe that 52 cents on every tax dollar is waste by the Federal Government. If there is any program that suggests this might be true, it is the regulation account at OSM which serves a smaller and smaller industry, and whose activities are being duplicated by more and more States.  Further, I am told that OSM has actually become a burden on State regulatory agencies, making excessive requests for data collection and studies that divert valuable resources from their own regulatory activities.  The proposed reduction in OSM's title V program should come out of the agency's inspection and regulatory activities which duplicate State programs. Adequate funding for State regulatory grants should be maintained, and my amendment is in no way intended to affect such grants.  Mr. President, in these tight budgetary times, a 28-percent reduction in the OSM regulatory budget is entirely reasonable. This cut will actually force OSM to streamline operations and eliminate many duplicative services that are a burden to State regulatory agencies.  I would suggest that the remaining cuts be from other Federal programs that duplicate State regulatory or oversight functions within function 300. If we intend to streamline the Federal Government, we can start with Federal activities that overlap with State agencies and programs. Overall, my amendment would cut three-fourths of 1 percent from this function. This small cut will provide substantial benefit to severely distressed regions of Appalachia.  In drafting this amendment, I have consulted with officials at ARC to help redesign the focus and size of the agency. It is my view that ARC should eliminate those functions that are beyond the central mission of economic development.  We also need to critically assess which areas that are currently under the jurisdiction of ARC no longer need its support, due to the success of ARC's programs.  There are a number of counties that have achieved the goal of economic self-sufficiency and therefore have outgrown the need for ARC funding.  My amendment would enable the ARC to focus its resources on those counties that struggle with the most severe economic hardships.  Let me conclude. If my colleagues believe that eliminating ARC will save money, they are sadly mistaken. The poverty and economic distress of central Appalachia will only deepen, imposing higher costs on other Federal programs. On the other hand, if we keep ARC alive, and help this region to help itself, we will be saving a lot more money in the long run.  Of course, all programs must make every effort to revaluate their mission and eliminate those functions that are no longer needed. I have proposed eliminating certain authorities of the ARC that are no longer needed, and reforming the eligibility criteria to take certain economically stabilized counties off the rolls. These reforms are assumed in the lower spending levels contained in my amendment.  In sum, this is a creative and commonsense way to save one of the few Federal programs that has actually worked: the ARC. Just as important, my proposal is consistent with the goal of balancing the budget which all of us want to achieve. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.
