President, I appreciate very much getting that into the Record because that testimony came out in our committee meetings. The Senator from Kansas is right. Sometimes when you sit in a committee meeting in Washington, everything is filtered. You do not really get the truth you find in the field.  This bill is going to put $449 million in real property and maintenance. The RPM accounts are accounts that are mandatory that we have to get down, and yet I have been down to Fort Bragg during a rainstorm. Go into the barracks and one will see our soldiers are actually covering up their equipment with their bodies to keep it from rusting. It is a crisis. We are addressing that crisis with this bill. It is a start. We should be doing more than we do with this particular bill.
