Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion offered by the gentleman from Martinez, CA, to instruct House conferees to not agree to the Senate-passed provision providing an incentive for leasing of the Outer Continental Shelf lands in water depths exceeding 200 meters.                              {time}  1230  Mr. Speaker, I chair the Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources of the Committee on Resources. We are the panel of jurisdiction on OCS oil and gas matters. I do not disagree with his assessment of the process at issue, the committee and subcommittee have not had a hearing on deepwater leasing incentives this Congress. However, the gentleman is very aware that the committee did hold an oversight hearing on June 23, 1994, on the ``Economic Health of the Domestic Offshore Oil and Gas Industry'' which focused on the desirability of incentives for the development of the Gulf of Mexico oil and gas resources.  The Clinton administration was noncommittal at that hearing but has since agreed with legislative provisions drafted in the other body which provide an incentive to lease and develop deepwater tracts. The gentleman makes reference to a lease sale conducted by the Minerals Management Service a few months ago which did indeed bring in nearly one-third of a billion dollars in bonus bids, some of which were for deepwater tracts. But, the gentleman from California misses the point--as the CBO has acknowledged by the revenue score on this provision, while a certain volume of oil and gas which may be discovered and developed on such tracts will be royalty free, the lost revenue is offset by expected increases in bonus bids at competitive auction of such tracts. In other words, Mr. Speaker, had the deepwater incentives been in effect for the leases offered up for bid in April, the sum of the high bids would likely have been much greater than even the admittedly large sum which was collected.  The MMS believes this to be the case, as well, and has thrown its support behind deepwater incentives structured in the manner outlined in the Senate position. That is, the average depth of water in the lease tract determines the number of barrels of oil, or equivalent volume of natural gas, for which no royalty would be due. Let me emphasize, Mr. Speaker the risk remains entirely with the lessee that hydrocarbon resources will be discovered in paying quantities. If a dry hole is drilled on a deepwater tract no royalty relief is available, of course, yet a bonus bid will have been paid to the U.S. Treasury, a bonus bid which will be incrementally larger than it would be without deepwater incentives. And if oil or gas is discovered, the economics of developing the field is enhanced such that wells will likely stay on line longer generating a larger domestic supply of an important resource.  For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I join with the chairman of the Resources Committee in opposing the motion of the gentleman from California. We should give our conferees as much latitude as possible to strike a deal with the other body which best serves the Nation. This motion restricts our ability to achieve that end, and should be defeated.
