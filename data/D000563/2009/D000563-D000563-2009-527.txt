Let me say, what happened to you in the conference committee has happened to all of us. You had an amendment adopted in the Senate. As I understand it, we all supported it. It died in conference. It is frustrating, something you believe in, something we all voted for, and you didn't get your way. But does that mean we are going to stop consideration of this conference report; we are not going to pass an Energy and Water appropriations bill because your amendment didn't survive in conference? If all 100 Members in the Senate took that position, we would never pass anything.
