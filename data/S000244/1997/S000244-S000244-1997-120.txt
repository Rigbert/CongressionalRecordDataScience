Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment that has been offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn]. I think there are two reasons why we should do this.  First, the NSF contributes $50,000 for this program. It is a controversial program, it is a program that has been set up by the United Nations, and as the gentleman from Oklahoma has stated, it has never been voted on by the Congress. The question is whether or not we can spend $50,000 on better research than this. I think we can. There is the secretariat in the State Department that is supposed to coordinate all of this money. It seems to me that there are a lot of people on the payroll, there is an awful lot of traveling around. That is not research in my mind. What is research is the type of stuff that the NSF can do inhouse with peer review grants to our universities, to our high schools, to our research institutions in the United States of America.  So it is a question of whether we want to spend the money on Man and the Biosphere or whether we want to spend the money on the other very worthwhile NSF research projects. I vote for spending the money on the other worthwhile NSF research projects.  Second, the gentleman from Oklahoma raises a very good point. The committee did offer, or did adopt, an amendment that he offered to the NASA bill that prohibits NASA funds from being contributed into this pot. The same arguments that I gave against using NSF funds for this pot are valid for NASA funds. I think it was probably an oversight that he was not able to offer the similar amendment to the NSF bill. This simply corrects the oversight, makes the Congress consistent in both NSF and NASA, and I would urge support of the gentleman from Oklahoma's amendment.
