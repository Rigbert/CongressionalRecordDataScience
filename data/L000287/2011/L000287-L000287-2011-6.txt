Madam Speaker, recently Atlanta Magazine gave a voice to the jobless in America. The words of one person speaks for millions. ``Unemployment dehumanized the real person,'' one American writes. ``You lose the essence of your identity and value. You become a number, a label, a resume, a failure, a defect, desperate, poor, and separated from society. Being unemployed is to be silently disrespected, on par with being homeless, mentally ill, or addicted.''  Today we speak for millions of Americans who will be pushed to the edges of our society, locked out and left behind, if we fail to act.  The jobless in America elected us so that they would have a voice in these debates. They are not points on a graph or numbers on a page. They are human beings. We must not abandon the people of this Nation. We must pass the unemployment insurance extension and do it without delay.  Wake up, Congress. Wake up, and do what is right.                          ____________________
