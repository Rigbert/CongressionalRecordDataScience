They are really scared. Debt is at a historic level, spending is out of control, the Nation's AAA credit rating is in jeopardy, and here we are.  We are going to spend $1 trillion over the next 10 years for just 6 years of benefits. Only in Washington can folks stand here and claim spending $1 trillion will actually cut the deficit.  And how did we get here? Well, we are going to start by raiding $523 billion from the Medicare checks of older Americans. Shameful.  Whatever happened to tort reform? Not here. The lawyers are going to continue to get richer suing doctors and hospitals, and older Americans will see their benefits evaporate. Where are our priorities?  Yesterday I introduced an amendment that would delay the bill until we can guarantee Medicare's solvency for at least the next 30 years, but it was denied. I guess they would rather spend money that we don't have rather than uphold our commitment to seniors. Debt continues to soar beyond belief. Today, every man and woman will spend $46,000 on the debt. Let's do better. We can.
