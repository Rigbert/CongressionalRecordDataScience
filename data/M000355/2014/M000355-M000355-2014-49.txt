 President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of the leading businessmen and entrepreneurs from the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Terry E. Forcht is the founder, chairman, and CEO of the Forcht Group of Kentucky and was honored to be named the ``Knox County Chamber 2014 Man of the Year'' in recognition of his success in business and his contributions to the community.  Terry was born and bred in my hometown of Louisville, KY. Like me, Terry attended the University of Louisville for his undergraduate studies. He also obtained his law degree from the UofL Brandeis School of Law and subsequently left the Commonwealth to obtain his MBA from the University of Miami in Florida.  Terry would not leave Kentucky for long, however. He returned in 1964 to serve as a chairman of the Commerce Department at Cumberland College--now the University of the Cumberlands--and 3 years later he started his own law practice in Corbin, KY.  In 1972, Terry bought the Hillcrest Nursing Home in Corbin--an acquisition that is widely considered to be the first piece of what would eventually become the Forcht Group of Kentucky. This initial purchase has grown into what is now called First Corbin Long Term Care and consists of nine health and rehabilitation centers in the region.  In 1972, Terry also became heavily involved in community banking. He was appointed to the board of directors of Corbin Deposit Bank and Trust Company, and as his interest and expertise in the industry grew, he founded Tri-County National Bank with a group of investors in 1985. As with his nursing home acquisition, this community bank quickly prospered and grew. Today there are 30 Forcht Bank locations in Kentucky with total assets of over $1 billion.  Mr. Forcht has grown his company over the years into a sprawling enterprise that employs over 2,100 people. The Forcht Group currently consists of 22 radio stations, 19 finance company offices, 2 insurance companies, 2 newspapers, a pharmacy and diagnostic lab, a retail furniture and gift store, a construction company, real estate, and several other small businesses.  Outside of his business, Terry still manages to find time to stay involved in his community. Although he is no longer a practicing lawyer, he is still a member of the Whitley County and Kentucky Bar Associations. In the past he has been president of the Whitley County Republican Party and has run for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. He also currently serves on the board of directors of the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce and the Kentucky Economic Development Board.  Terry's success in business has also allowed him and his wife Marion to pursue their passion for philanthropy. They are both active members of Grace on the Hill Methodist Church and have generously donated large sums of their hard-earned money to the University of Louisville, the University of the Cumberlands, and to the University of Kentucky. Many generations of Kentuckians will undoubtedly find new opportunities open to them because of Terry and Marion's contributions to education in the State.  The Knox County Chamber 2014 Man of the Year Award is a fitting tribute to a man who has contributed so much to his community. Terry's entrepreneurial zeal and commitment to furnishing quality higher education in his State set a glowing example for us all. Therefore, I ask that my U.S. Senate colleagues join me in honoring this exemplary citizen.                          ____________________
