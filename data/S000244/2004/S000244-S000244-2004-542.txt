Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, with all due respect to my colleague from Wisconsin (Ms. Baldwin), she had an opportunity to advance the bankruptcy bill on November 14, 2002, but voted against the rule to bring up the conference report that contained the compromise language relative to the abortion clinic protestors judgment discharge, and that vote was rejected, 172 to 243. Had that rule passed, obviously the conference report would have passed, the President would have signed the bill at the end of 2002, and we would not be here talking about any of these issues here today.  But I rise in opposition to this amendment because as we begin this debate, I want to make it perfectly clear that by opposing this amendment we are not in any respect jeopardizing the financial well-being of family farmers, or as proponents of this amendment have tried to construe the issue, holding farmers hostage. Nothing could be further from the truth.  The reality is that Senate 1920, as it will be voted on today, already accomplishes everything this amendment does and, indeed, much more. Since its enactment, Chapter 12 has lapsed on six occasions. The shortest lapse periods was 20 days; the longest was approximately 10 months. As with prior measures reenacting Chapter 12, the bill before us is retroactive, which will protect family farmers.  Mr. Chairman, you should know that the amendments simply extract one series of reforms from pending bankruptcy legislation. But what opponents of the amendment fail to include, however, are literally hundreds of other reforms in Senate 1920 that would benefit farmers in many other ways and nearly all Americans as well.  Although my colleague on the other side of the aisle essentially asserts that farmers are being held hostage to bankruptcy reform, the reality is that bankruptcy reform is being held hostage. Just look at the roll calls and who voted which way in the eight or nine votes that the House has had since 1998.  Here are just a small sample of the reforms being held up by opponents of overall reforms: First, reforms giving the Justice Department and the courts the tools they need to deal with fraud and abuse in the current bankruptcy system. Voting for this amendment and against the bill means that the Justice Department and the courts will not have those tools to deal with fraud and abuse.  Second, remedies addressing the so-called ``mansion loophole'' by which corporate criminals and other wrongdoers can shield their million dollar homes from the just claims of their creditors. And that includes employees of major corporations that had their 401(k)s looted as a result of stock prices tanking and they could not diversify what was in the 401(k)s.  So try telling that to an Enron or WorldCom employee that we are going to allow future corporate wrongdoers to be able to stiff their employees as well. The amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Baldwin) would allow that to happen. The base bill does not.  Third, reforms representing deadbeat parents from using bankruptcy as a means of avoiding their child support obligation. This bill increases the priority of child support obligations in bankruptcy. The Baldwin amendment does not do that. The National Child Support Enforcement Association states that these reforms are crucial to the collection of child support during bankruptcy. Do not turn your back on custodial parents who have to file bankruptcy because they cannot collect their support.                              {time}  1500  Fourth, authorization for the appointment of additional bankruptcy judges in districts where there is a huge backlog of bankruptcy cases. Voting for the Baldwin amendment will mean justice delayed being justice denied. Voting against it and passing the bill will allow more judges to prosecute these cases to a conclusion.  Fifth, protections for victims of crimes of violence from being further victimized by criminals who file for bankruptcy relief.  Sixth, reforms requiring consumers to receive important information about the alternatives to, and consequences of, bankruptcy before they file for relief. Is it not better that people not file for bankruptcy because they can get better information and counseling to prevent them from having a scarlet letter being attached to their name because they had to go through bankruptcy?  There are also provisions waiving the filing of bankruptcy fees for the indigent. If my colleagues vote for the Baldwin amendment and against the bill, those provisions are not there.  There are reforms requiring millions of consumers to receive a monthly credit card billing statement that would include specific disclosures about the increased interest and repayment time associated with making minimum payments. A lot of people end up having to file for bankruptcy because they get themselves further and further in the hole with revolving credit card payments. If there is a warning on that and some information on that on the statements maybe not as many people will end up getting in that hole.  Also, the enactment of long-overdue reforms intended to reduce systemic risk in the banking and financial marketplace by minimizing the risk of disruption when parties to certain financial transactions become bankrupt or insolvent, the so-called netting provision. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan has said these reforms are extremely important. They are extremely important for economic stability. The authors and supporters of the Baldwin amendment turn their backs on these reforms.  Also, protections against the disclosure of the name of a debtor's minor children in public bankruptcy files. Apparently, the people who want to strip these reforms out want anybody to go into a courthouse and see the names of minor children in a parent's bankruptcy file and let that become a matter of public discussion. There are also provisions preventing debtors from selling their customers' personally identifiable information.  The bill has reforms requiring the appointment of an ombudsman to safeguard the interests of patients in health care facilities that are in bankruptcy. Support the amendment and vote down the bill; there is no ombudsman to help out those patients in the bankrupt health care facility.  In light of the disastrous impact that bankruptcy cases like WorldCom and Enron have had on their employees, reforms that more than double the current monetary cap on wage and employee benefit claims entitled to priority under the bankruptcy code are included in my bill, but not the amendment that is before the House.  Other provisions would protect retirees in cases where chapter 11 debtors unilaterally modify their benefits, such as health insurance. We protect as best as possible retirees of a bankrupt company in forcing the company to try to uphold their health insurance obligation to those retirees.  Vote for the Baldwin amendment; those are not in there. My bill has got them.  These reforms would make it easier to recover excessive pre-petition compensation such as bonuses paid to insiders of a debtor that can be used to pay unpaid employee wage claims. My bill has got that. The amendment does not.  I should also point out that chapter 12 is rarely utilized by family farmers. Last year, less than 700 chapter 12 cases were filed out of the nearly 1.7 million bankruptcy cases filed during the same period. When chapter 12 lapses, as it has in the past, farmers can still seek bankruptcy relief under other chapters of the bankruptcy code; so we do not leave farmers that need to file for bankruptcy out in the cold. Merely what we do is enact chapter 12 on a permanent basis, and because of the provision in retroactivity and the amendment that was just adopted, their cases can be converted to chapter 12 once that chapter is reenacted.  While we obviously care about family farmers, we also care about the indigent, the patient, the single moms with unpaid support claims, retired employees who have lost their health benefits and the financial well-being of millions of consumers. Accordingly, Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
