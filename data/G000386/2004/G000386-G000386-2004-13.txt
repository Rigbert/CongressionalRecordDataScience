 President, today I am introducing a bill directing the Inspector General of the Department of Justice to submit semi-annual reports regarding settlements relating to false claims and fraud against the United States.  The False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729 et seq., is the Government's single most effective program for recouping money improperly obtained from the United States by false claims and fraud. Initially passed during the Civil War at President Abraham Lincoln's request to suppress fraud against the Union Army, the FCA was modernized and updated in 1986. Since President Ronald Reagan signed the 1986 amendments into law, settlements and judgments in FCA cases have exceeded $13 billion. No other antifraud program of the federal government can match this result.  Despite the significance of these results, the Congress does not have a way to evaluate the performance of the FCA program. While the program, which is overseen by the Civil Division of the Department of Justice, appears to be doing well, it is not known at this time how the program is performing as compared to its potential. What percentage of the various frauds perpetrated against the United States is recouped in False Claims Act cases? How effectively does DoJ capture the multiple damages and penalties provided for by the act? How quickly does DoJ move FCA cases? How effectively does DoJ use the tools provided to it by the FCA, such as civil investigative demands? How effectively does DoJ use relators and how well does it reward them?  The purpose of this bill is to require the submission of the information that will allow Congress to evaluate of DoJ's performance in managing FCA cases. Thus, under this bill the Department of Justice will be required to describe its settlements of FCA cases. The report to Congress shall include a description of the estimated damages suffered by the United States, the amount recouped, the multiplier used to calculate the settlement amount, the criminal fines collected and whether the defendants were held liable in previous cases. The report will also inform Congress as to whether the defendants have been required to enter into corporate integrity agreements.  In addition, in order to understand how the program is working, the Department of Justice will be required to inform Congress as to whether civil investigative demands were issued. The Department will also be required to provide certain information about the conduct of qui tam cases initiated by whistleblowers. For example, Congress will receive information about the length of time cases are under seal, whether whistleblowers (technically termed ``relators'') sought a fairness hearing regarding a settlement and what share of the settlement they received. The Congress would also receive information about whether the agency that suffered from the fraud involved participated in the settlement.  In regard to cases involving Medicaid Fraud, the report will provide Congress with the details of how much money was returned to each state participating in the settlement. In a time when many States are struggling with their Medicaid budgets, the Congress needs to know how effectively DoJ is in suppressing Medicaid fraud and returning money to the States.                                 ______                                       By
