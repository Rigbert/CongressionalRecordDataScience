Chairman, as my colleagues know, I am a strong supporter of vocational education. Tonight, I would say to my colleagues that this amendment is being used not to help vocational education. If that were the case, then the $119 million cut in 1995 and the proposed $325 million cut in fiscal year 1996 would never have occurred.  Frankly, last year essentially you took the President's number. My opinion is you took the President's number because you did not want to shut down Government. You thought that was bad politics. I agreed with you.
