President, the Senate is now considering H.R. 4297, the tax reconciliation conference report. This bill contains several important tax relief provisions, including relief from the alternative minimum tax, extended expensing provisions for small businesses, and a 2-year extension of the 15 percent tax rate on dividends and capital gains. I will be voting for this bill in order to block tax increases that would be harmful to our economy and to our citizens.  According to the latest data that I have seen, more than 100 million American taxpayers benefit from the various tax reductions that we have passed since 2001. In Maine, 100,000 taxpayers have benefited from the lower capital gains and dividends tax rate, and about 25,500 Maine taxpayers have benefited from AMT relief.
