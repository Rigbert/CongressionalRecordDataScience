Speaker, I rise today to recognize, on the occasion of his 60th birthday, a true leader of our time and a transformative figure in the post-Soviet world, Alexsander Kwasniewski. Not only did President Kwasniewski lead Poland through a dramatic transition to freedom, he has remained an active participant on the global scale, contributing his experience and energy to helping others and fostering stability and cooperation in his region.  On his birthday, it is important to recognize his contributions to Poland's rise on the international stage, its leadership in Eastern Europe and its relations with the United States. With today's geopolitical events in Eastern Europe concerning Russia and Ukraine, it is important to recognize and honor those who support the ideal of democracy and freedom for everyone who so desires it.  Mr. Kwasniewski served two presidential terms from 1995 to 2005. During this time, he worked hard for European integration, leading the bid from Poland to join NATO and the EU and joining both in 1999 and 2004, respectively. Prior to his presidency, as part of the Social Democratic Party of the Republic of Poland, Mr. Kwasniewski participated in the Polish transformation in government from a communist nation to a democratic one in the famous Round Table negotiations in 1989. He has been decorated and recognized globally as a political thought leader, receiving the Jan Karski award in 2006 for opposing anti-Semitism and serving as an inspiration for international mediation efforts during Ukraine's 2004 ``Orange Revolution,'' which eventually led to Ukrainian democracy.  The Congressional Caucus on Poland, which I have the honor to co-chair, focuses on promoting bilateral relations between Poland and the United States and raising the profile of issues that are important to both countries. That relationship is why today we honor Mr. Kwasniewski as someone who has been and still is a valuable contributor to peace, prosperity and civil liberties in Poland and the world.                          ____________________
