Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(2) of rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives, I hereby submit the rules of the Committee on the Judiciary for the 109th Congress for publication in the Congressional Record. These rules were adopted by the Committee on January 26, in a meeting that was open to the public.                           Rules of Procedure                                Rule I.       The Rules of the House of Representatives are the rules of      the Committee on the Judiciary and its Subcommittees with the      following specific additions thereto.                      Rule II. Committee Meetings       (a) The regular meeting day of the Committee on the      Judiciary for the conduct of its business shall be on Tuesday      of each week while the House is in session.       (b) Additional meetings may be called by the Chairman and a      regular meeting of the Committee may be dispensed with when,      in the judgment of the Chairman, there is no need therefor.       (c) At least 24 hours (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and      legal holidays when the House is not in session) before each      scheduled Committee or Subcommittee meeting, each Member of      the Committee or Subcommittee shall be furnished a list of      the bill(s) and subject(s) to be considered and/or acted upon      at the meeting. Bills or subjects not listed shall be subject      to a point of order unless their consideration is agreed to      by a two-thirds vote of the Committee or Subcommittee.       (d) The Chairman, with such notice to the Ranking Minority      Member as is practicable, may call and convene, as he      considers necessary, additional meetings of the Committee for      the consideration of any bill or resolution pending before      the Committee or for the conduct of other Committee business.      The Committee shall meet for such purpose pursuant to that      call of the Chairman.       (e) Committee and Subcommittee meetings for the transaction      of business, i.e. meetings other than those held for the      purpose of taking testimony, shall be open to the public      except when the Committee or Subcommittee determines by      majority vote to close the meeting because disclosure of      matters to be considered would endanger national security,      would compromise sensitive law enforcement information, or      would tend to defame, degrade or incriminate any person or      otherwise would violate any law or rule of the House.       (f) Every motion made to the Committee and entertained by      the Chairman shall be reduced to writing upon demand of any      Member, and a copy made available to each Member present.       (g) For purposes of taking any action at a meeting of the      full Committee or any Subcommittee thereof, a quorum shall be      constituted by the presence of not less than one-third of the      Members of the Committee or     subcommittee, except that a full majority of the Members of      the Committee or Subcommittee shall constitute a quorum for      purposes of reporting a measure or recommendation from the      Committee or Subcommittee, closing a meeting to the public,      or authorizing the issuance of a subpoena.       (h)(1) Subject to subparagraph (2), the Chairman may      postpone further proceedings when a record vote is ordered on      the question of approving any measure or matter or adopting      an amendment. The Chairman may resume proceedings on a      postponed request at any time.       (2) In exercising postponement authority under subparagraph      (1), the Chairman shall take all reasonable steps necessary      to notify Members on the resumption of proceedings on any      postponed record vote.       (3) When proceedings resume on a postponed question,      notwithstanding any intervening order for the previous      question, an underlying proposition shall remain subject to      further debate or amendment to the same extent as when the      question was postponed.       (i) Transcripts of markups shall be recorded and may be      published in the same manner as hearings before the Committee      and shall be included as part of the legislative report      unless waived by the Chairman.       (j) Without further action of the Committee, the Chairman      is directed to offer a motion under clause 1 of rule XXII of      the Rules of the House of Representatives whenever the      Chairman considers it appropriate.                           Rule III. Hearings       (a) The Committee Chairman or any Subcommittee chairman      shall make public announcement of the date, place, and      subject matter of any hearing to be conducted by it on any      measure or matter at least one week before the commencement      of that hearing. If the Chairman of the Committee, or      Subcommittee, with the concurrence of the Ranking Minority      Member, determines there is good cause to begin the hearing      sooner, or if the Committee or Subcommittee so determines by      majority vote, a quorum being present for the transaction of      business, the Chairman or Subcommittee chairman shall make      the announcement at the earliest possible date.       (b) Committee and Subcommittee hearings shall be open to      the public except when the Committee or Subcommittee      determines by majority vote to close the meeting because      disclosure of matters to be considered would endanger      national security, would compromise sensitive law enforcement      information, or would tend to defame, degrade or incriminate      any person or otherwise would violate any law or rule of the      House.       (c) For purposes of taking testimony and receiving evidence      before the Committee or any Subcommittee, a quorum shall be      constituted by the presence of two Members.       (d) In the course of any hearing each Member shall be      allowed five minutes for the interrogation of a witness until      such time as each Member who so desires has had an      opportunity to question the witness.       (e) The transcripts of those hearings conducted by the      Committee which are decided to be printed shall be published      in verbatim form, with the material requested for the record      inserted at that place requested, or at the end of the      record, as appropriate. Individuals, including Members of      Congress, whose comments are to be published as part of a      Committee document shall be given the opportunity to verify      the accuracy of the transcription in advance of publication.      Any requests by those Members, staff or witnesses to correct      any errors other than errors in the transcription, or      disputed errors in transcription, shall be appended to the      record, and the appropriate place where the change is      requested will be footnoted. Prior to approval by the      Chairman of hearings conducted jointly with another      congressional Committee, a memorandum of understanding shall      be prepared which incorporates an agreement for the      publication of the verbatim transcript.                         Rule IV. Broadcasting       Whenever a hearing or meeting conducted by the Committee or      any Subcommittee is open to the public, those proceedings      shall be open to coverage by television, radio and still      photography except when the hearing or meeting is closed      pursuant to the Committee Rules of Procedure.                     Rule V. Standing Subcommittees       (a) The full Committee shall have jurisdiction over the      following subject matters: antitrust law, tort liability,      including medical malpractice and product liability, legal      reform generally, and such other matters as determined by the      Chairman.       (b) There shall be five standing Subcommittees of the      Committee on the Judiciary, with jurisdictions as follows:       (1) Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellect      Property: copyright, patent and trademark law, information      technology, administration of U.S. courts, Federal Rules of      Evidence, Civil and Appellate Procedure, judicial ethics,      other appropriate matters as referred by the Chairman, and      relevant oversight.

(4) Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security:      Federal Criminal Code, drug enforcement, sentencing, parole      and pardons, terrorism, internal and homeland security,      Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, prisons, criminal law      enforcement, other appropriate matters as referred by the      Chairman, and relevant oversight.

(c) The Chairman of the Committee and Ranking Minority      Member thereof shall be ex officio Members, but not voting      Members, of each Subcommittee to which such Chairman or      Ranking Minority Member has not been assigned by resolution      of the Committee. Ex officio Members shall not be counted as      present for purposes of constituting a quorum at any hearing      or meeting of such Subcommittee.              Rule VI. Powers and Duties of Subcommittees       Each Subcommittee is authorized to meet, hold hearings,      receive evidence, and report to the full Committee on all      matters referred to it or under its jurisdiction.      Subcommittee chairmen shall set dates for hearings and      meetings of their respective Subcommittees after consultation      with the Chairman and other Subcommittee chairmen with a view      toward avoiding simultaneous scheduling of full Committee and      Subcommittee meetings or hearings whenever possible.                   Rule VII. Non-Legislative Reports       No report of the Committee or Subcommittee which does not      accompany a measure or matter for consideration by the House      shall be published unless all Members of the Committee or      Subcommittee issuing the report shall have been apprised of      such report and given the opportunity to give notice of      intention to file supplemental, additional, or dissenting      views as part of the report. In no case shall the time in      which to file such views be less than three calendar days      (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays when the      House is not in session).                      Rule VIII. Committee Records       The records of the Committee at the National Archives and      Records Administration shall be made available for public use      according to the Rules of the House. The Chairman shall      notify the Ranking Minority Member of any decision to      withhold a record otherwise available, and the matter shall      be presented to the Committee for a determination on the      written request of any Member of the Committee.                          ____________________[Pages H259-H260]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]   PUBLICATION OF THE RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, 109TH                                 CONGRESS
