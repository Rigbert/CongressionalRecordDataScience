Mr. Speaker, I call the attention of my colleagues to one of several deeply disappointing developments in Russia. Deputy Sergei Kovalev, our colleague in the Russian Parliament and longtime human rights activist, resigned his post as head of President Yeltsin's human rights commission earlier this week. Well known to anyone who has followed the course of human rights and democratic development in Russia, Mr. Kovalev was a political prisoner under the Communist regime and he has been highly critical of the Yeltsin government's policies in Chechnya. During the first weeks of the Russian attack on Grozny, the Chechnya capital, Mr. Kovalev bravely travelled to the region to see the facts for himself. For his efforts to stop the killing and terrorizing of both Chechens and Russians, he was roundly condemned and even threatened by fervent Russian nationalists.  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Kovalev's resignation comes at a time when President Yeltsin appears to be casting off the last of his democratic orientation and throwing in his lot with rapid nationalists, allegedly reformed Communists, and cabinet cronies. Though he talks a reform line, President Yeltsin's actions demonstrate otherwise. In his resignation letter, Sergei Kovalev charges that President Yeltsin's government is ``trying to run the country in a direction completely contrary to the one proclaimed in August 1991.'' This is a very disturbing course for Russia, for its neighbors, and for the entire world.  I urge President Yeltsin to return to the path of reform as the only genuine guarantee of peace and justice for Russian people, and Mr. Speaker, I trust the administration is using every appropriate opportunity to make that point to Mr. Yeltsin and his associates.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to have included in the Record Sergei Kovalev's letter of resignation to President Yeltsin.  The text of the letter follows, as reprinted in the January 29, 1996 Washington Post.                        The Case Against Yeltsin                          (By Sergei Kovalev)       (From a letter of resignation sent Jan. 24 to Russian      President Boris Yelstin by Sergei Kovalev, who had been      chairman of the president's human rights commission since      October 1993.)       For the past six years I have considered it my duty to      promote in every way possible the policy that can fairly be      called the ``democratic transformation of Russia''      notwithstanding many reservations. For a long time that      policy was closely linked with your name. You were the head      of a country on the road to democracy, and at first, you were      even considered the leader of the democrats. As long as you      remained headed in that direction, I considered myself your      ally, or, in those instances when you departed from the      overall course or drastically allowed the tempo of advance, a      member of the loyal opposition.       Russia's road to freedom never promised to be easy. Many      difficulties were obvious from the very beginning. Many      others cropped up unexpectedly. To overcome them, all of us--     the government, society, each individual--had to make      complicated and sometimes tragic decisions. The main things      the country expected from you were the will to make changes      and honesty. Especially honesty. In electing you, Russia saw      not only a politician ready to demolish the former state      structure, but a person who was sincerely trying to change      himself, his views, his prejudges and his habits of rule. You      convinced many--myself included--that humane and democratic      values could become the foundation of your life, your work      and your policies. We weren't blind. We saw the typical      traits of a Communist Party secretary preserved in your      behavior. But all Russia, like a man striving to overcome a      serious defect, was struggling with itself. We understood you      even when we did not love you.       In recent years, however, even though you continue to      proclaim your undying devotion to democratic ideals, you have      it first slowly, and then more and more abruptly, changed the      course of government policy. Now your government is trying to      turn the country in a direction completely contrary to the      one proclaimed in August 1991. . . .       Beginning in late 1993 if not even earlier, you have      consistently taken decisions which--instead of strengthening      the rule of law in a democratic society--have revived the      blunt and inhuman might of a state machine that stands      above justice, law and the individual. . . .       During the tragic days of the fall of 1993 [when Yeltsin      dissolved the Supreme Soviet], I decided to stand by you      despite my serious inner doubts. I don't deny my      responsibility for that support. I believed that the use of      force was a tragic necessity given the imminent threat of      civil war. Even then I understood that the events of October      might encourage the top leaders to perceive force as a      convenient and familiar instrument for resolving political      problems. But I hoped for a different outcome, that by      overcoming the crisis of legitimacy and creating a basis for      the rule of law in Russia, the president and the government      would do everything possible for our country's peaceful and      free development. To a very great extent, the outcome      depended on you, Boris Nikolaevich. I believed that you would      choose the second path. I was wrong.       The 1993 Constitution confers enormous powers on the      president, but it also places enormous responsibilities on      him to be the guarantor of the rights and liberties of      citizens, to safeguard their security and to protect law and      order in the country. How have you discharged these duties?      How have you fulfilled your responsibilities?            You have virtually halted judicial reform, which was      designed to make the administration of justice truly      independent from the other branches of government. You openly      professed the principle, ``Let the innocent suffer as long as      the guilty are punished.''       You loudly proclaimed the launching of a war on organized      crime. In order to implement this, you granted exceptional,      extralegal authority to the security ministries. The result?      The criminals continue to roam freely, while law-abiding      citizens have to tolerate the abuse of the uniformed forces      without gaining the security they were promised.       You stated that your goal was the preservation and      strengthening of the Russian Federation's territorial      integrity. The result? A shameful and bungled civil war which      has been raging in the North Caucasus for more than a year.      Under the guise of strengthening Russia's defense capability,      you've blocked all military reforms which would give Russia      an effective modern army. The result? Spending on the army      is growing, and the number of generals has increased to an      indecent figure. In order to justify their existence, the      term of service has been increased and draft deferments      have been ended. Meanwhile, soldiers and officers are      impoverished, ragged and hungry. And the degradation, ill-     treatment and corruption, traditional in our army, are as      prevalent as ever. Not surprisingly, tens of thousands of      young men are evading this medieval recruitment like the      plague.       You speak of a policy of openness, of transparency and of      public accountability, yet at the same time you sign secret      decrees concerning the most important matters of state. You      create closed institutions, and you classify as secret ever      more information about government operations and the state of      the country. Presidential decisions are made almost in the      same backroom fashion as in the era of the Politburo. It's no      secret that you increasingly depend on the security services      and on their system of clandestine information. Isn't it      obvious to you how unreliable and tendentious this      information is?       The thrust of your personnel policy is becoming clearer      with each passing day. At first there were quite a few      competent, honorable people around you. But you also      enthusiastically welcomed individuals whose only virtue      consisted in their personal loyalty to you. Gradually such      loyalty has become your primary demand when recruiting staff,      just as it was in the heyday of the Community Party. . . .       You began your democratic career as a forceful and      energetic crusader against official deceit and party      disposition, but you are ending it as the obedient executor      of the will of the power-seekers in your entourage. You took      an oath to build a government of the people and for the      people, but instead you have built a bureaucratic pyramid      over the people and against the people. Moreover, having      rejected democratic values and principles, you haven't      stopped using the word ``democracy'' so that naive people may      well believe that ``democrats'' remain in power in the      Kremlin. Your policies have compromised the very word, and if      democracy is fated to someday exist in Russia (and I believe      it will), it will exist not because of you, but in spite of      you.                          ____________________
