Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to place in the Record communications that have been sent to this House from the President of the American Farm Bureau Federation, Mr. Dean Kleckner, where the federation met with the task force representing 10 different State Farm Bureau Presidents to consider the situation that is facing rural America.  I would like to include their report in the Record, but I just wanted to quote one section here, which indicates that net farm income is projected to fall by over $7 billion this year, and the level of a $500 million disaster allocation will not begin to address this shortfall. They are asking Congress to focus on immediate remedies to redress producers, and given the magnitude of the agricultural economic problem, emergency supplemental funding of several billion dollars is justified.  I think in view of the Farm Bureau's position over past years, this is quite a significant statement, and we appreciate their hard work in helping us resolve this situation for our producers across the country.  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record the correspondence just referred to in my statement.                              American Farm Bureau Federation,                               Washington, DC, September 11, 1998.     Hon. Newt Gingrich,     The Speaker, House of Representatives, Capitol Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Speaker: I recently appointed a task force of 10      state Farm Bureau presidents to consider the economic      situation facing agriculture and to make recommendations      regarding legislative and administrative changes necessary to      increase farm income. The task force filed its report, and      the leadership of the American Farm Bureau Federation      wholeheartedly approved those recommendations. The attached      report outlines the priorities that Farm Bureau believes need      to be implemented to increase farm income and agricultural      exports.       When producers agreed to support the FAIR Act in 1996,      Congress assured them that its passage would be accompanied      by regulatory reform, tax changes, private property      protection, and trade policies designed to improve our global      competitiveness. These commitments have not been met, thus      exacerbating the current farm crisis.       I urge you to take immediate action to help alleviate the      crisis currently facing farmers and ranchers.           Sincerely,                                                    Dean Kleckner,                                                        President. Report of the Committee on the Farm Economy, September 11, 1998, Bob                            Stallman, Chairman       When producers agreed to support the FAIR Act in 1996, they      were assured by Congress that its passage would be      accompanied by regulatory reform, tax changes, private      property protection and trade policies designed to improve      global competitiveness and increase foreign markets. These      commitments have not been met thus exacerbating the current      farm crisis.       Farm Bureau has long been a proponent of balancing the      budget and the ``pay as you go'' concept of offsetting      increased spending with reductions elsewhere in the budget.      However, the failure of Congress to fulfill its commitments      necessitates immediate restitution by requesting emergency      supplemental funding to assist producers facing depressed      prices and/or weather-related disasters.       Farm Bureau firmly believes that current low price are not      due to the failure of the FAIR Act. Instead, they are      reflective of the failure to compete aggressively in foreign      markets due to government restrictions and the inability or      unwillingness of the Administration and Congress to fulfill      their promise to open foreign markets for U.S. producers.      With 96 percent of the customers living outside U.S. borders,      these failures cannot be allowed to continue.       In the limited time prior to adjournment, Congress must      focus on the agricultural     issues which will immediately aid producers suffering through      disasters and low prices, as well as trade issues where the      impact may not be immediate--but if ignored until the next      Congress--will adversely affect the agricultural economy for      years to come.       The problems facing agriculture are diverse--low commodity      prices, crop disaster losses, livestock feed losses, and      export market barriers that have reduced overseas markets. A      ``one size solution won't fit all.'' Therefore, the proposed      solutions address each of the problems individually.       Giving that background, Congress and the Administration      must focus on the following agricultural priorities:                            Short Term needs                  Supplemental crop insurance payments       A crop disaster assistance program must be implemented. The      $500 million in emergency funding included in the Senate      agricultural appropriations bill is insufficient. It is      imperative that any disaster assistance be implemented in      a way that maintains the integrity of the crop insurance      program. We must avoid sending a signal to producers that      discourages them from further participation in the      program.       The crop insurance program is so inflexible it cannot be      adjusted to unique situations. It is incapable of responding      to multi-year disasters and leaves producers unable to insure      crops at a reasonable level. Supplemental crop insurance      payments must be made for those suffering from disasters.      Payments should not be limited to those suffering from multi-     year disasters.                      Sanctions Indemnity Program       Unilateral trade sanctions are costing American farmers      access to critical markets. Those lost markets have caused      poor market prices and reduced sales volume. Program and      minor crop producers must be compensated for those lost      markets via direct funding. Sanctions Indemnity Payments      should not be restricted by any payment limitations.       Unilateral sanctions have become the weapons of the moment      to address actions by our trading partners when the U.S.      disagrees with some action they take. There is no record of      unilateral sanctions producing anything favorable from either      an economic or political standpoint. They simply shut U.S.      producers out of needed markets. Our competitors are only too      happy to sell in these markets. The U.S. earns the reputation      as a unreliable supplier when sanctions are imposed.       There currently are about 120 unilateral trade sanctions in      place. Over half of those have been implemented during the      last four years. It is estimated that over 11 percent of the      world's wheat market lies outside the reach of U.S.      producers.                        Changes to the FAIR Act       Congress must avoid abandoning the market-based policies of      the FAIR Act. Producers are reallocating their resources in a      more efficient manner than the government could ever dictate.      The loan program is intended as a method to lessen pressure      to sell at harvest time and spread sales throughout the      marketing year. It is a marketing tool for producers, not an      income support program.       Raising commodity loan rates or extending the loan period      should be discouraged. Such action would be a clear signal to      our competitors that once again we are willing to forego our      markets and guarantee sales to them. It is a short term fix      that has grave longer term economic implications. Any      possible short term gains will be obliterated by storage      cost, lower prices when the loans ultimately come due and the      loss of world market share. Both farm producers and taxpayers      would lose.                    Disaster Feed Assistance Program       Funding is needed for some type of assistance to livestock      producers suffering weather related disasters. Congress      should fund a Disaster Reserve Assistance Program or      Emergency Livestock Feed Assistance Program to reimburse      those producers who have experienced disaster related losses      for a substantial portion of the cost of purchasing feed.                                 PL 480       Several foreign economies are near economic and political      collapse. Now is an excellent time for the United States to      donate products to these countries. We support enhanced      funding for the PL 480 program. Enormous opportunities exist      for humanitarian and public relations benefits, in addition      to an opportunity to impact market prices. It is important to      provide relief to our long term customers who are at risk of      liquidating their livestock sectors. These markets must be      supported as they are future long-term customers for U.S.      products. The PL 480 program should not only be used to help      move product to traditional customers, but increased to      include customers who may not currently qualify for GSM      credits.                             Credit relief       A change in current law to allow producers more flexibility      in obtaining Farm Service Agency (FSA) guaranteed farm      ownership and operating loans is necessary. Under current      law, FSA can guarantee operating loans up to $400,000 and      ownership loans up to $300,000. The caps should be combined      to allow producers to borrow up to $700,000 from one or both      programs.       The FSA guaranteed loan program should be expanded,      particularly to assist young farmers and ranchers.       Current law generally requires FSA operating loans to be      repaid within seven years. While Farm Bureau has long called      for discontinuance of FSA lending to anyone unable to build      up enough equity to get financing elsewhere after 10 years,      the eligibility period for current borrowers should be      extended for producers affected by disasters. Farmers should,      at least, get the same treatment as other small businesses      and homeowners do when floods, hurricanes, and other natural      disasters occur.       Congress should oversee FSA's administration of the      emergency loan procedures to ensure that application approval      is expedited, paperwork is streamlined, and the process is      more user-friendly.                   Conservation Reserve Program (CRP)       There are currently 30 million acres under contract to CRP.      Adequate funding should be provided to allow USDA to      accomplish full enrollment at the authorized 36.4 million      acres cap.       The announcement for the 18th CRP sign-up will be made this      month. However, land accepted during that sign-up will not      enter the program until October 1999. Entrance must be      accelerated to early 1999.       In addition to the land traditionally accepted into the      CRP, Congress should urge the Administration to target some      of the newly-enrolled land towards mitigating emerging      disease and pest situations such as wheat scab, potato blight      and Karnal bunt.                          Extended assistance       Since projections indicate that 1999 crop prices will not      improve significantly, Congress should consider a two-year      assistance program to help producers cope with current low      prices expected to extend into the next crop year.                            long term needs                              Trade issues                               Fast-Track       Fast-track negotiating authority must be passed. Continuing      to delay the implementation of fast-track is reducing      critical time needed to define and advance U.S. negotiating      objectives for the next round of multilateral negotiations,      and the opportunity to realize meaningful gains in increasing      market access. Discussions have already begun for the Free      Trade Area of the Americas. Our trading competitors are not      waiting for the U.S. to step forward as the leader but are      moving forward to create agreements that we can only hope      will not disadvantage the U.S.                   International Monetary Fund (IMF)       Congress should act quickly to provide the full $17.9      billion requested for the IMF. The IMF was created to help      stabilize national monetary systems in times of fiscal      instability. Countries must be determined to be creditworthy      to be eligible to participate in the GSM guaranteed loan      programs. These programs make possible the sale of U.S.      products into critical markets, and help maintain market      share and product visibility. The IMF must have the necessary      funding to address financial market instability as it occurs      around the world. In order to break the Congressional      stalemate, we favor basic reforms to IMF policies.                            Sanctions Reform       Food and agricultural products should not be used as a      foreign policy tool.       In just four years the U.S. has imposed 61 unilateral      economic sanctions on 35 countries. These countries contain      about 40 percent of the world's population, and thus, a large      lost market for U.S. farm output.       Congress should pass legislation that would help prevent      future useless embargoes or sanctions by requiring a      reasonable evaluation of the consequences of imposing      unilateral sanctions before they are imposed.                 Market Access and Development Programs       Congress should fully fund the Market Access Program to the      $210 million authorized and provide necessary funding for the      Foreign Market Development Program. These programs need the      expertise provided by a fully supported Foreign Agricultural      Service that is expanded to cover all existing and potential      market posts.                               Tax issues       The next tax bill should include the Farm and Ranch Risk      Management Accounts (FARRM). This would encourage farmers and      ranchers to save for a ``rainy day'' by allowing them to      deposit up to 20 percent of pre-tax net farm income into an      interest-bearing account. Funds could be withdrawn and taxed      over the subsequent five-year period.       Congressional efforts should also be focused on addressing      farmers' cash flow problems this fall and winter. Tax      legislation should include lengthening of the net operating      loss rules so that net operating losses could be carried back      more than two years and acceleration of the health insurance      tax deduction for self-employed individuals.                             Crop insurance       The crop insurance program must be fixed. Congress and the      Administration must take a hard look at this program to      determine how to make it a more viable risk management tool.      For several years, we have attempted to ``tinker'' with the      program. We will ``tinker'' again this fall due to the      inadequacies and lack of flexibility in the program. With an      increasing number of producers relying on crop insurance as      their primary risk management tool, Congress must     commit to spend the time, effort and money to overhaul it.      This obviously cannot be done prior to adjournment. However,      a commitment by the House and Senate leadership to schedule      floor consideration of major program changes early next      spring would send a very positive signal that it does not      intend to let the inadequacies linger.                                Funding       Net farm income is projected to fall by $7.4 billion in      crop year 1998. A $500 million disaster allocation will not      begin to address this shortfall. Because the agenda to which      Congress committed is woefully incomplete, Congress must      focus on immediate remedies to redress producers. Given the      magnitude of the agricultural economic problem, emergency      supplemental funding of several billion dollars is justified.       The AFBF Committee on the Farm Economy urges Congress to      adopt the above recommendations to insure the future      viability and competitiveness of U.S. agricultural producers.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hinojosa).
