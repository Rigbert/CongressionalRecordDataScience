The amendment is very straightforward. If I can have just a moment or two, I will describe it for those who are interested.  It is an amendment relating to disclaimers on television and radio ads, as well as in print media. It requires of those electioneering communications--the so-called Snowe-Jeffords ads--that they abide by the same requirements for disclaimer and disclosure as ads for candidates themselves and ads authorized by candidates, and independent express advocacy ads. It requires, when it comes to these ads, that they also show on the screen, for example, not only the name of the organization that is sponsoring the ad, paying for the ad, but also either an address, phone number, or Internet Web site.  I can give a very inspired speech as to why this is necessary. But I think the concept is very basic. It is that we do not want to restrict freedom of expression, nor in fact do we restrict freedom of deception. If somebody wants to put an ad on that is categorically wrong, whether it is a candidate, a party, or any other group, I guess there is an American right to that. But we do, I hope, insist on accountability. At least identify who you are. If you are going to be part of our political process, tell us who you are. That is exactly all this does in terms of disclaimer. Whether it is a candidate, whether an ad authorized by a candidate, or so-called electioneering communication, that is what will happen. It applies to printed communications as well.  For those keeping track, this was part of McCain-Feingold in both the105th and 106th Congress--a large portion of it was. It is something that many of us believe, and it was adopted by the House, would complement the work we have done thus far in the debate.
