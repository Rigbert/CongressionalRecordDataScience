President, the people of Maine have always been faithful stewards of the forest because we understand its tremendous value to our economy and to our way of life. From the vast tracts of land in the north to the small woodlots of the south, forest land helps shape the character of our entire State. While our commitment to stewardship has preserved the forest for generations, there is a new threat to Maine's forest that requires a new approach.  The threat is suburban sprawl, which has already consumed tens-of-thousands of acres of forest land in southern Maine. Sprawl occurs because the economic value of forest or farm land cannot compete with the value of developed land. The problem is particularly acute here in southern Maine where a 108 percent increase in urbanized land over the past two decades has resulted in the labeling of greater Portland as the ``sprawl capital of the Northeast.''  I am alarmed by the amount of working forest land and open space that has given way to strip malls and cul-de-sacs. Our State is trying to respond to this challenge. The people of Maine have approved a $50-million bond to preserve land through the Land for Maine's Future Board, and continue to use scarce local funds and contribute their time and money to preserve important lands and to support our State's 88 land trusts.  The people of Maine are forging a new approach to preserving our working forest and protecting our communities from sprawl. It is time for the Federal Government to support these efforts.  Today I am introducing the Suburban and Community Forestry and Open Space Initiative Act. The legislation, which was drafted with the advice of land owners, conservation groups, and community planners, establishes a $50-million grant program within the U.S. Forest Service to support locally-driven projects that preserve working forests. State and local governments, as well as nonprofit organizations, would compete for funds to purchase land or conservation easements to keep forest lands, threatened by development, in their traditional use.  Projects funded under this initiative must be targeted at lands located in parts of the country that are threatened by sprawl. The legislation requires that Federal grant funds be matched dollar-for-dollar with State, local, or private resources. The grant program will help promote sustainable forestry and public access to forest lands. My legislation protects the rights of property owners with the inclusion of a ``willing-seller'' provision and it allows non-profits, States, and municipalities--but not the Federal Government--to hold title to land or easements purchased under the program.  The $50 million that would be authorized by my bill would help achieve a number of stewardship objectives. First, my legislation would help prevent forest fragmentation and preserve working forests, helping to maintain the supply of timber that fuels Maine's most important industry. Second, the resources made available as part of my legislation would be a valuable tool in communities that are struggling to manage growth and prevent sprawl. Currently, if the town of Gorham, ME or another community trying to cope with the effects of sprawl turned to the Federal Government for assistance, none would be found. My bill will change that by making the Federal Government an active partner in preserving forest land and managing sprawl, while leaving decision-making at the State and local level.  We can all be proud of the work being done in Maine to protect our working forests for the next generation, and I am grateful that many of the people and organizations that are leading this effort are supporting my legislation. By enacting the Suburban and Community Forestry and Open Space Initiative Act Congress can provide a real boost to conservation initiatives, help preserve sprawl, and help sustain the vitality of natural resource-based industries.                                 ______                                       By Ms. Collins:  S. 1634. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to improve the safety of perishable products whose import is regulated by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
