President, I appreciate what the Senator said. I hope people understand who are listening. I know the two Senators from Michigan are going to speak very briefly. But if we wrapped up the comments in, say, the next 15, 20 minutes, we could then go to a rollcall vote on Helene White. I would agree, then, to a voice vote on the other two judges, provided the ranking member had no objection to that, which would probably bring about a huge sigh of relief from Senators on both sides of the aisle that we would not be stuck here with three votes.
