Mr. Speaker, upon the occasion of his retirement, I rise today to give special recognition to Lawrence P. ``Larry'' Cotter, a great friend and an outstanding, hardworking, and dedicated Alaskan. Larry has contributed tremendously to the positive evolution of our fisheries management in Alaska, the Pacific Northwest, and indeed the entire country. Larry has lived in Alaska and worked in the commerial fishing industry since 1974. He spent over four years as a seafood processing worker in Juneau, and eight years as a labor organizer and representative for seafood processing workers and longshoremen. Larry served on the Advisory Panel to the North Pacific Fishery Management Council for six years and then as a voting member of the Council for an additional six years. The time of Larry's service on the Council was during the transition years when foreign fishing was being phased out, our U.S. domestic fishing and processing capabilities were stepping up to replace the foreign fleets, and allocation issues among U.S. fisheries interests were first coming to the forefront. These were difficult, challenging, and exciting times--during which Larry was chair of several committees, including the Bycatch Committee and Crab Management Committee. Larry also served as chair of the Council's Steller Sea Lion Mitigation Committee and Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute's Responsible Fisheries Management Committee.  Most recently, until late this year, Larry has served as founding CEO of the Community Development Quota (CDQ) Group, known as the Aleutian Pribilof Island Community Development Association, or ``APICDA.'' It is in this area of service to APICDA and his helping to develop, implement and sustain, not only APICDA, but the entire CDQ program, that Larry did perhaps his best work, accomplishing goals that will have positive impacts on Western Alaskan Communities for generations to come. Larry's work on the formation of Alaska's CDQ program has benefited all of the participating communities and his more than twenty-five years with APICDA has helped to develop the workforce, build infrastructure, and improve the economy throughout the Western Alaska Region.  Larry's longtime leadership in the seafood industry has helped to guide and shape the policies and programs that many enjoy today. Many observers, myself included, have correctly noted that Alaska has the best managed fisheries in the country, perhaps in the world, and I know we could not have achieved that status without Larry's tireless dedication and devotion to making our seafood industry sustainable for the long haul. Thank you Larry for your tremendous contributions to sustainable fisheries and to the participation of our coastal communities in those fisheries. Enjoy your retirement, and best of luck in your continuing endeavors.                          ____________________
