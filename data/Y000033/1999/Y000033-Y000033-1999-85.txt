Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against Section 506 of the bill, found at page 36, lines 21 to 25. This language repeals the Denali Commission Act of 1998 and constitutes legislation on an appropriations bill in violation of clause 2(b) of rule XXI of the rules of the House of Representatives.
