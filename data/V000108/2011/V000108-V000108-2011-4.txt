Speaker, on October 27, 2011, I was absent from the House and missed rollcall votes 813 through 815.  Had I been present for rollcall No. 813, on passage of H.R. 2576, to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify the calculation of modified adjusted gross income for purposes for determining eligibility for certain healthcare-related programs, I would have voted ``no.''  Had I been present for rollcall No. 814, on a motion to recommit with instructions on H.R. 674, to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal the imposition of 3 percent withholding on certain payments made to vendors by government entities, I would have voted ``aye.''  Had I been present for rollcall No. 815, on passage of H.R. 674, to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal the imposition of 3 percent withholding on certain payments made to vendors by government entities, I would have voted ``aye.''
