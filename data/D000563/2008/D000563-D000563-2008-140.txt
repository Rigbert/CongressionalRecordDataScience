BROWN. I think he was against it before he was for it. He was for the head of SEC, Chris Cox, and now he is against him. Maybe tomorrow he will want Secretary Paulson fired. I don't know. He has been for a lot of things before he has been against them, unfortunately. I thank the Senator from Illinois.  I yield the floor.
