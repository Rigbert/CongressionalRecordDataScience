Speaker. I rise today to congratulate Calvin United Church of Christ in Toledo, Ohio as it celebrates 110 years of worship in the historic Birmingham neighborhood of Toledo's East Side. Worshipers will come together in a special celebration on Sunday, September 29, 2013.  Toledo's Birmingham neighborhood was established and grew when Hungarian workers were relocated from Cleveland to Toledo to work in foundries. More and more Hungarian workers came to Toledo and the neighborhoodquickly established itself. In 1891, these immigrants founded the Magyar Reformed Church. The building was designed by local architect T. W. Matz and was completed in 1901. Echoing features of Hungarian village churches, its design is that of Hungarian Neo-Baroque church, with a tower, four round arched windows and round-shaped clocks pointing to each cardinal direction. The Hungarian coat-of-arms can be found on the bottom of each of the stained glass windows. The church stands still at its original location at the corner of Bogar and Bakewell Streets in Toledo.  The church was incorporated by the State of Ohio as the Hungarian Church of Toledo on June 16, 1903. The name was changed to Calvin United Church of Christ in 1962.  Since its beginning, Calvin United Church of Christ has been an anchor of Toledo's East Side and its Birmingham neighborhood. Its members are community leaders and the church is a good neighbor. Following the Scriptures call in 1 Chronicles 16:9 to ``Sing to Him, sing praises to Him; meditate on and talk of all His wondrous works and devoutly praise them!'' Calvin United Church of Christ's faithful have lived Christ's Word across three centuries and continue a proud tradition in its neighborhood. We are pleased to congratulate the congregation as it approaches its 110th anniversary, and look forward to its efforts in Christ's service for years to come.                          ____________________
