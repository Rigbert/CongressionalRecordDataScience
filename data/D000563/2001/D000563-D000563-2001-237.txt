When she was sworn in on June 12, 2001, Ms. Van Tine became not only the first judge in Illinois of South Asian heritage, but the first female Indian American judge in the Nation.  With a fast-growing community of Asian Americans in Cook County, it is important that the Judiciary reflects the diversity of the people it serves. I applaud Chief Judge Donald P. O'Connell and other Circuit Judges of Cook County for electing this outstanding lawyer to join them on the bench.  Judge Van Tine is a highly experienced attorney with a distinguished record of service to the people of Illinois. She most recently served as Special Counsel to Illinois State Comptroller Daniel W. Hynes, in a position where she oversaw the regulation of approximately one billion dollars in Illinois consumer trust funds entrusted pursuant to the laws governing the cemetery and funeral industries.  Prior to joining the Comptroller's Office, Judge Van Tine was a Cook County Assistant State's Attorney for 12 years. In this capacity she tried hundreds of cases, both in the Criminal Division where she prosecuted violent offenders, as well as in the Civil Division where she saved taxpayers millions of dollars in lawsuits.  In addition to her public service positions, Judge Van Tine has been active with voluntary bar activities. A past president of the Asian American Bar Association and a former executive committee member of the Alliance of Bar Associations for Judicial Screening, she is currently on the board of the Women's Bar Association of Illinois, and is a founding member of the Chicago chapter of the Indian-American Bar Association.  Her contributions to the legal profession are extensive. Judge Van Tine was an adjunct professor for Trial Advocacy at the Chicago-Kent College of Law, and has served as a mock judge for local and national moot court competitions. She has written a book chapter in the American Bar Association's publication of ``Dear Sisters, Dear Daughters: Words of Wisdom from Multicultural Women Attorneys Who've Been There and Done That.'' She also assisted in establishing a legal clinic at the Indo-American Center, which has been providing legal assistance to the Asian American community since 1997.  Judge Van Tine has made numerous appearances at law schools, bar programs, and symposiums to educate law students, attorneys, and community members about various aspects of law and issues affecting Asian Americans, such as hate crimes. She has also discussed the issue of running ethical judicial campaigns on a cable program aired by the Illinois Judges Association.  Judge Van Tine is a member of the Fourth Presbyterian Church where she has participated in conducting Cabrini Green Health workshops for children, serving as a Cook County Hospital candy striper, and volunteering as a Sunday nursery school teacher.  Judge Van Tine earned her law degree at New York Law School and her undergraduate degree from Oakland University. She has completed several graduate courses at Michigan State University focusing on inter-cultural communication. Judge Van Tine has been married for 13 years to Matthew Van Tine, an attorney specializing in commercial and antitrust litigation. They have a young daughter named Kristen.  As the senior Senator of the State of Illinois, I ask my colleagues to join me on the occasion of her appointment to the bench in congratulating Rena Marie Van Tine for all of her accomplishments.                          ____________________
