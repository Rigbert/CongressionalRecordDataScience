This situation makes no sense given the similar cost of labor across southern New England and the unusually heavy commuting patterns between Rhode Island and the Boston and Hartford pay localities, especially with the Boston area. It is only 45 miles from Providence to downtown Boston.  The question before us now is, how did we get into this situation, and how can we correct it? The main obstacle to federal locality pay in Rhode Island is the federal government's use of county data to determine the eligibility of ``Areas of Application'' to existing pay localities. First of all, I would note that Rhode Island has no county governments, and the Federal Salary Council's use of county data is, therefore, impractical and arbitrary. Secondly, the criteria for application are structured in such a way that our state cannot become eligible. To be considered, a county must be contiguous to a pay locality; contain at least 2,000 General Schedule employees; have a significant level of urbanization; and demonstrate some economic linkage with the pay locality, defined as commuting at a level of 5% or more into or from the areas in question.
