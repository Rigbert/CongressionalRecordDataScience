 President, I rise today as I and a number of my colleagues do every year to mark and remember a dark day in human history: The beginning of the systematic extermination of 1.5 million Armenian men, women, and children.  On April 24, 1915--eighty-three years ago--the Ottoman Empire launched a brutal and unconscionable policy of mass murder. Over an eight year period, 1.5 million Armenians were killed, and another 500,000 were driven from their homes, their land and property confiscated.  As we remember the dark past of the Armenian people, however, our act of remembrance also offers the opportunity to celebrate hope and the resilience of the human spirit. Today, the people of Armenia can look to a promising future, as they continue to work for democracy and peace in their homeland.  The Armenian genocide was the first genocide of the twentieth century, an appalling precursor to events in Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, Cambodia, Bosnia and Central Africa, as well as too numerous other places. As we mark this day of remembrance, people of conscience around the world must redouble our commitment to fight for human dignity and freedom, and vow to never again allow genocide to occur.                          ____________________
