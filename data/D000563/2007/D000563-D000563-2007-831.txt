President, Abraham Lincoln once said, ``The declaration that `all men are created equal' is the great fundamental principle upon which our free institutions rest.''  As a Senator representing the distinguished land of Lincoln, I take seriously our Nation's promise for equality, particularly when it comes to health care.  I rise today as a strong and proud cosponsor of the Minority Health Improvement and Health Disparity Elimination Act of 2007--an important piece of legislation, long in the making, and long overdue.  Not since 2000 has our Congress made a concerted effort to address the health of some of our most at-risk populations--people of color.  In these 7 years, we have not seen a substantial improvement in the health status of people of color.  Cervical cancer, a disease that can be greatly reduced by effective health care, is five times more common among Vietnamese women in the United States than it is among Caucasian women.  African Americans with diabetes are seven times more likely to have amputations and develop kidney failure than are Caucasians with diabetes.  In Chicago's Latino community, you will likely find one in two Latino children who are obese, a condition that often leads to the onset of diabetes.  In the hospitals of East St. Louis, it's likely that African-American babies die at more than double the rate of White infants.  In the small town of Cairo, families have to travel hours to other parts of the State and sometimes even to other States to obtain the right care.  In general, we are making progress in prolonging life. Death rates for Whites, African Americans, and Latinos from many of our most debilitating diseases have declined during the last decade. But what progress are we making on quality of life during those extra years? Is the answer different depending on the racial or ethnic minority groups? Simply speaking, yes.  Even when controlling for insurance coverage and economic status, racial and ethnic minorities tend to have less access to health care and a lower quality of health care than their Caucasian counterparts.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that, among a wide range of health indicators, ``relatively little progress has been made toward the goal of eliminating racial/ethnic disparities.''  In general, yes, Americans are healthier, but the shameful gaps between minority groups and Caucasians remain nearly the same as a decade ago.  When will we as a nation demand more and work harder to reach that ideal of equality that is a pillar of our Nation's moral strength?  This legislation is a critical step toward achieving that notion of equality: the belief that we are all created equal and as such should have equal access to quality care.  Why is it that this country spends so much more than any other industrialized country on its health care, but has consistently lagged behind other countries in delivering better health outcomes? Why is it that one in six Americans, almost one in three African Americans, almost one in two Latino Americans, are uninsured? Why do our health outcomes not reflect the $2 trillion investment we make in health care each year? There is a disconnect between the rhetoric around our Nation's health crisis and where our resources are placed. It is a shame, and we can do better.  Our health workforce should reflect, understand, and respect the backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives of the people it serves. We need to recruit, train and retain health care professionals from underrepresented groups and underserved areas.  In areas like downstate Illinois, small communities rely heavily on Federal incentives, such as loan repayment, the Health Careers Opportunity Program, and Centers of Excellence to create a critical pipeline of professionals.  Graduates of title VII programs are more likely to serve in underserved areas. That is the outcome we want, so we need to support successful programs like these.  In addition to improving the diversity of our workforce, we need to redouble efforts to fight diseases that disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minorities--diseases like diabetes, heart disease, breast cancer and so many others.  To accurately respond to the presence of health care disparities and try to address them, we need better data on health care access and utilization that includes race, ethnicity, primary language, and socio-economic status. To develop accurate solutions, we need accurate information on prevalence, contributing factors, and effects of health care disparities.  The Minority Health Improvement and Health Disparity Elimination Act of 2007 is a critically important step toward improving the access, workforce, research and information that will close the color gap that exists in health care today. I look forward to working with my colleagues to improve the health of all Americans and, specifically, to eliminate health disparities that hurt our communities of color, and all of us.  I did not always agree with the former majority leader, Senator William H. Frist, but I couldn't agree more with his statement that, ``Inequity is a cancer that can no longer be allowed to fester in health care.''  I urge my colleagues to support the health disparity legislation introduced today.                                 ______                                       By
