President, will the Senator yield for a question?  I thank the Senator for his presentation. Now that we are in the national debate over tax cuts, and the question of projections, I heard a statistic last week which I think the Senator might also have heard.  Five years ago, the economists were trying to predict what would happen this year. This whole tax cut is based on our projections into the future of 5 years and 10 years. Five years ago, economists--the same people to whom we are turning--suggested that--I believe these numbers are correct--we would face a $320 billion deficit this year; five years ago, a $320 billion deficit. It is my understanding that instead we have a $270 billion surplus.  The same economists that we are basing our projections on for 5 and 10 years missed it by $590 billion in this year.  If that is the fact, when we project where we might be going with this tax cut, I think the Senator makes a good point.  Let us be conservative. Let us be sensible. Let us be prudent to make sure we don't overspend any surplus in the future.
