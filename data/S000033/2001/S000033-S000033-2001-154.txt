 Speaker, today I recognize the outstanding work done by participants in my Student Congressional Town Meeting held this summer. These participants were part of a group of high school students from around Vermont who testified about the concerns they have as teenagers, and about what they would like to see government do regarding these concerns.  I submit these statements to be printed in the Congressional Record, as I believe that the views of these young persons will benefit my colleagues.On Behalf of Kevin Van Genechten--Regarding Global Warming, May 7, 2001       Kevin Van Genechten. My name is Kevin Van Genechten, doing      global warming, for Colchester. Global warming is the steady      rise in temperature caused by buildup of gases like CO2 and      methane gas in the Earth's atmosphere. The gases act like the      glass in a greenhouse; they let the heat in, but not out. The      main cause of gas buildup is the burning of coal, oil and      wood CFCs. 1998 was the hottest year in thousands of years.      The nine hottest years on record have all been in the past      two decades. Humankind's actions on the global scale have      changed not just the landscape of the earth, but the world's      climate too. Increasingly sophisticated measures of the      Earth's climate and the weather systems have provided a      wealth of evidence that the earth has been getting steadily      warmer. An intergovernmental panel for climate change set up      in 1988 to put together the thinking on global warming is      leading the search. It has found that global temperatures are      increasing alarmingly, already having risen between .3      Celsius and .6 Celsius in the last century. Sea levels are      rising and previous environments are being altered, some      irreparably. The rising temperatures we have witnessed may      seem slight, but are we currently experiencing the greatest      rate of change in the temperature ever. The effects are      already being felt, and things may get much worse. Most of      the impact of global warming won't be felt for another 30      years. And yet hurricanes, storms and extreme weather      conditions are recorded almost weekly. Our reckless      destruction of the environment through industrial pollution      is creating a dangerous world. The burning of fossil fuels,      such as oil and coal, and the emission of harmful gas must be      addressed if we are secure ourselves a future on planet      Earth. And although interested parties are bringing pressure      from the big pressure groups like the Worldwide Fund for      Nature--which may soon disappear--it may be these gestures      are too little, too late. There is still hope in the air and      time in this millennium to make the necessary changes to      happen. However, we leave this century fudging on fossil-fuel      emission targets, which almost everyone now agrees is the      strongest way to combat global warming. Big changes in      lifestyle and energy production will be needed to slow the      global-warming time bomb.                                  ____                                  On Behalf of Katie Kevorkian, Carlin Hebert, and Bethany Wallace--High   Drop-Out Rates, Focusing on Inadequate Social Services, May 7, 2001       Bethany Wallace. Our subject is the increasing dropout rate      in, not only our county and our school, but, you know, across      the nation. It said in the little packet that we were going      to focus on the lack of social services which I don't think      we did.       Congressman Sanders. That's okay.       Bethany Wallace. That is not really what we are focusing      on. My part--I will give you a little basis. We didn't really      know a lot about the dropout rate when we were given this      task to present. So what we did is, we divided it into      factors that would affect the dropout rate. And mine is the      alternative programs, Katie's is the pregnancy rate, and      Carlin's is the extracurricular activities. At Mt. Anthony,      we have an alternative program that I don't think a lot of      people are aware of, and we certainly didn't know what it was      all about. So we went to the alternative program a few days      ago and just sat down and interviewed both the students and      the teachers there. And what we found out was that the      alternative program is a combination of two former programs,      the girls program and the boys program. And right now it's in      one building, and it is funded by the high school, it is      considered part of the high school, but with its own budget.      There are about 25 students in the program right now, all      different levels in high school. They also have a branch of      that for the middle schoolers, that is called the Stars      Program, but we didn't really dig into that. The students      there--we have a little list--have been referred to the      program because of a variety of reasons, varying from high      absenteeism, which is what they said in there, and poor      performance academically, for whatever reason. In sitting      down with the students and talking to them about it, more      than three-quarters of them said that, if it wasn't for this      program, they probably would have dropped out of high school.      So in presenting this to you, I just hope to show you how      beneficial these programs can be. However, they do have      faults. The students that graduate from the program graduate      with a normal high school diploma, and to achieve that      diploma, you have to have the same requirements of credits      that we in the high school have, and that is 26 credits. The      difference is that their classes are all pass-fail. And I      have--just personally, I have mixed emotions about that,      because I just don't know--I won't get into that. But their      classes are all pass-fail. They get a normal high school      diploma. They are not always there for just four years. It      varies. They can be there for five years, they can be there      through the Stars program and the alternative program. There      are three main teachers in the program. And what they were      telling us was,     and what you could see, is that it was designed as kind of a      family-type of thing, where the teachers knew a lot about the      personal lives of the students, and the students really liked      that. If they didn't want them to know about their personal      lives, they would usually leave. And one of the problems--     because we also wanted to know what was wrong with the high      school, what the students in the program didn't like about      the high school. And a lot of what they said was how big it      is. And, as you saw with the group that went before us, we do      have a very big school, so you can get lost, in that you can      slip through the cracks. If you need help and you don't go      for it, it is not always given to you. And these people, they      do come--the majority of them come from broken homes or      dysfunctional families or things where they have a lot of      problems, and are not getting the help that they need. And      their teachers in the high school, they were saying, weren't      always aware of that, and weren't really interested in that.      So in the program, they work through things. The teachers are      not only educators, but they are also kind of counselors and      moms, and they give hugs and everything. We thought it was      the coolest thing when we went over there. We didn't know      what to expect, and we came back, and we were like: Oh, my      God! We just couldn't believe it. But it does seem like a      very close-knit thing. And the classes are constructed--     they're offered as needed. Like if 15 of the students really      need a Western Civ class that semester, that is what the      teachers will do. Another problem that might be with the      alternative program is, we found out that one of the teachers      is only certified to teach--was it elementary English and      social studies? And we didn't really know how that worked in.      And I kind of had a problem with that; I don't know if Carlin      and Katie did. But it seemed to work for them.       Congressman Sanders. Okay.       Bethany Wallace. That's basically the gist on the      alternative programs. And we found that, especially with it      coming from the students, it was really helpful, and they did      a lot to keep the kids in school.       Congressman Sanders. Bethany, thank you. Katie or Carlin,      are you going to go next?       Carlin Hebert. I focused more or less on extracurricular      activities and how they affected dropout rate. And like the      other group said, the extracurricular       Katie Kevorkian. I focused on the pregnancy factor. And I'm      going to start out with a little story that was told to me by      the teachers in the Stars program, one of the teachers in the      middle school program. She had a girl a few years ago who, at      13, became pregnant. And once that happened, she couldn't      attend school anymore, she couldn't attend the Stars program,      because, once you have a baby, you can't really do that. And      she couldn't find childcare. She actually had twins at age      13, and the woman there was her teacher, who was trying to      get her an education. She sent her to tutorial centers, she      helped her set up childcare, but the girl apparently was very      disagreeable with her childcare, and ended up taking her kids      out of that. She is now 15, and she has missed so many      credits that she cannot graduate high school at age 18, and,      at 15, she was working on her GED. I interviewed people from      two places, two area places, where pregnant teenagers often      go. One was the Tristate Pregnancy Center, and they basically      give out--they try to educate teenagers when they are      pregnant, and show them their options. And then they work      through another place I interviewed, Sunrise Family Resource      Center, to help them get their GED and finish their      education. Sunrise also does that. They try to provide      childcare. They have programs such as Reach Up, which helps      with--they try to get them some benefits. And the other one      is--Can you let me see that? Vermont Homeroom. They try to      get childcare and educate them. And pregnancy is a problem.      It has gone down in the last ten years, but, in our      community, it is still a huge problem. The rate is higher      there than in any other place in Vermont. No, the rate is      higher there than the rate in Vermont. Excuse me.                               ____________________
