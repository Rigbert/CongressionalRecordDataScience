President, I hope Senators will support this amendment. It has strong bipartisan support. It speaks to the moral goodness of our Nation. It ensures that the waiver in current law is available to asylum seekers who were forced to join terrorist groups or to provide material support against their will.  Completely innocent victims of ethnic and other forms of violence and repression are being denied asylum for engaging in the very activity they were forced to engage in, even though they pose no threat to U.S. security--child soldiers, sex slaves of people who were among the worst violators of human rights. Those victims are being excluded by our great, good Nation.  They deserve our compassion. Let us bring our laws back in line with our values.  I hope we will adopt this amendment.  Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from Minnesota on the floor. I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Minnesota.
