Speaker, today I rise to honor 150 years of development and growth. Over a century and a half ago the St. James Lutheran Church, the oldest Lutheran congregation in Fulton County, OH, was founded. Strong in heritage and faith, the church has served as a pillar in that community and continues to foster ideals and philosophy consistent with moral prosperity.  Their story began in 1837 when a group of family members known as the Leininger family, including at least four brothers and two sisters, came to the United States from France. Their journey across the Atlantic Ocean via sailboat led them to New Orleans, up the Mississippi, and eventually to German Township, what we know today as Fulton County, OH, settled on the western side of Ohio's Ninth District.  Nine years after settlement, the Leiningers were approached by Pastor John Adam Detzer who headed the effort in the northwest Ohio territory to settle German Lutherans. They received Pastor Detzer with great excitement and asked him to be their pastor. Despite an already full congregation throughout the territory, he agreed and began to preach, listen, and spread the good word.  It was from that humble beginning that St. James evolved. The St. James congregation has survived and grown into a cornerstone of the Fulton County community.  I know my colleagues join me today in recognizing the congregation of St. James Lutheran Church on the occasion of 150 years of dedication, devotion, and commitment to the spiritual and communal needs of the people of northwest Ohio.                          ____________________
