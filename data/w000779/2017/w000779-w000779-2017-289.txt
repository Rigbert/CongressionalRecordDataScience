If you look at the demographics, there are going to be 10,000 people turning 65 every day for years and years to come. Senators Stabenow and Cantwell are making a point about flexibility. The reality is, if I look at the demographic picture, we are going to need more out of a lot of care options--institutional care, community-based coverage. But I think the point Senator Cantwell started us on is that, at a time when we have a demographic where we are going to need more for a variety of care options--a continuum of care--what my State is basically saying is that we are going to get less of everything. There is going to be less money for the older people who have nursing home needs. I am looking at a new document from the Oregon Department of Human Services, and it indicates that we are going to lose substantial amounts--something like $150 million for community-based kinds of services. So I appreciate the point my two colleagues are making.
