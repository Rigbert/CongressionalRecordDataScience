 President, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri. This amendment would needlessly delay OSHA from implementing regulations to prevent one of the leading causes of work place injuries, musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs).  Each year, more than 600,000 American workers suffer work related MSDs and it is costing businesses $15 to $20 billion in workers' compensation costs alone. It is estimated that one out of every three dollars spent on worker's compensation is related to repetitive motion injuries.  Many of the jobs that are disproportionately subject to ergonomic injuries are held by women. In fact, while women experience 33 percent of all serious workplace injuries, they suffer 61 percent of repetitive motion injuries. This includes:  91 percent of all injuries related to repetitive typing;  61 percent of repetitive placing injuries;  62 percent of work related cases of tendinitis; and  70 percent of carpal tunnel syndrome cases.  The supporters of this amendment argue that OSHA should delay ergonomic protection until the National Academy of Sciences completes a second review of existing studies. This comes despite the fact that there is already substantial scientific evidence linking MSDs to the workplace.  The first study completed by the National Academy of Sciences found that ``research clearly demonstrates that specific interventions can reduce the reported rates of musculoskeletal disorders for workers who perform high-risk tasks.'' That peer reviewed study was conducted just last year.  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health reviewed more than 2,000 studies of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. They concluded that ``compelling scientific evidence shows a consistent relationship between musculoskeletal disorders and certain work related factors.''  In a letter to the Department of Labor, William Grieves, president of the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, notes that ``there is an adequate scientific foundation for OSHA to proceed with a proposal and, therefore, no reason for OSHA to delay the rulemaking process while the National Academy of Science panel conducts its review.''  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         American College of Occupational and Environmental            Medicine,                                                February 15, 1999.     Charles N. Jeffress,     Assistant Secretary of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health,          U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Jeffress: The American College of Occupational and      Environmental Medicine (ACOEM) urges you to move forward with      a proposed Ergonomics Program Standard.       The College represents over 7,000 physicians and is the      world's largest occupational medical society concerned with      the health of the workforce. Although the College and its      members may not agree with all aspects of the draft proposal,      we support the Occupational Safety and Health      Administrations's (OSHA) efforts to promulgate a standard. An      ergonomics program standard that ensures worker protection      and provides certainty to employers is preferable to the      uncertainties of the general duty clause. As physicians, the      College's members will vigorously participate during      rulemaking to ensure that a final standard is protective of      workers, represents the best medical practices and is      supported by the science of musculoskeletal diseases.       It is incumbent on OSHA to carefully consider the science      and to give all due consideration to the results that will      come from the National Academy of Science panel's review of      the scientific literature regarding musculoskeletal      disorders. However, there is an adequate scientific      foundation for OSHA to proceed with a proposal and,      therefore, no reason for OSHA to delay the rulemaking process      while the National Academy of Science panel conducts its      review.       The College looks forward to its active participation in      this rulemaking. In the interim, please do not hesitate to      contact me or Dr. Eugene Handley, Executive Director.           Sincerely,                                                  William Greaves,                                                        President.
