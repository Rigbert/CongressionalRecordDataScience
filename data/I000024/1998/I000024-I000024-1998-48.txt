President, this is very simple. It is not a complicated thing to deal with. It simply says that we take the language that is supported and has been put in by the distinguished Senator from Vermont and add--I will read it one more time, these words--       This subsection shall not apply unless the Joint Chiefs of      Staff and the unified combatant commanders certify in writing      to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the      Committee on National Security of the House of      Representatives that the signing of the Convention is      consistent with the combat requirements and safety of the      armed forces of the United States.  So it is a very straightforward and simple amendment. Quite frankly, I want to have the input of the military when these decisions are made.
