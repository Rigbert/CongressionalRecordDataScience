Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Family Services Improvement Act, H.R. 1480, which I reintroduced yesterday.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to imagine, if they will, a single mom who is trying to get off welfare. Mom drops her 4-year-old off at Head Start, takes her 7-year-old to second grade and goes to her own graduate equivalency degree classes, all in the same school.  When the family needs immunizations or health screenings, they can go to the school-based clinic. The social services coordinator at the school can help the family find housing, food, and health care. There is also a job placement coordinator to help mom find a job when she finishes her classes.  Unfortunately, my colleagues, as you well know, this model of coordinated, one-stop programs to help children and families move off Government assistance is rare.  The Family Services Improvement Act will create incentives for establishing coordinated one-stop programs. It will make the programs we promote more effective and efficient and more available. I urge the support of my colleagues for this important legislation.                          ____________________
