Mr. President, I too, want to congratulate and commend my distinguished colleague from Alabama for his leadership and perseverance in getting this legislation passed. I fully support S. 768, which I believe was significantly improved with this most recent substitute amendment. The due process considerations regarding appearances before U.S. Magistrates before removing civilians from overseas were added after earlier Senate consideration and, I believe, improve the bill. This important legislation will close a gap in Federal law that has existed for many years. With foreign nations often not interested in prosecuting crimes against Americans, particularly when committed by an American, the result is a jurisdictional gap that allows some civilians to literally get away with murder. The House Report 106-778, which Senator Sessions just referred to a moment ago, outlines many of the problems resulting from this loophole. I agree with Senator Sessions with respect to the report. I am glad this legislation will pass this Congress because the gap that has allowed individuals accompanying our military personnel overseas to go unpunished for heinous crimes must be closed. That is why I have been a strong proponent and co-sponsor of this legislation. I yield the floor.
