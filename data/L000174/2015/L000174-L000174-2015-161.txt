We have two options: Pass the USA FREEDOM Act or let the provisions expire. A growing majority of the Senate--a straight up-or-down vote--supports the USA FREEDOM Act. If we pass it today, the President can sign it today or tomorrow.  Also, the intelligence community says: Is the law going to be here or is the law gone? By passing the USA FREEDOM Act, they can move forward with the certainty they need to protect the American people.  Senator Lee and I, along with a bipartisan group of Senators ranging from Senator Durbin, to Senator Heller, to Senator Schumer, to Senator Cruz--and that is going across the political spectrum--are moving for a responsible path forward.  We have worked for 2 years on this bill to end the NSA bulk collection of Americans' phone records. Republicans and Democrats have worked together for 2 years to end the NSA's bulk collection of Americans' phone records, something that every one of us, at a townhall meeting--I do not care what State you are in, if you ask Americans ``Do you want a bulk collection of all your phone records?'' you know what the answer would be: ``Of course not.''  The clock has run out, but there is a responsible choice before us. Let's pass the USA FREEDOM Act today. Then we will have important reforms, we will keep America secure, and we will not have all of these authorities expire.  Mr. President, I see other Senators on the floor.  I yield the floor.
