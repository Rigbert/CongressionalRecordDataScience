CASTRO of Texas. I yield to the ranking member.  Mr. DeFAZIO. I thank the gentleman, and I want to congratulate him on his diligence and on his foresight here to propose this amendment. It was an oversight in replacing the current council with a new membership. I am not exactly certain why we need to do that because we haven't heard particular complaints.  In any case, this is an improvement upon the newly recommended council to include minorities and women fully engaged, since I see a lot of those folks out in the back country in my State, and I am sure you do in Texas, too.  So I am pleased that for one brief moment here, we have a bipartisan consensus. With that, I congratulate the gentleman.
