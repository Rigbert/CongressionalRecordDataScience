Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman and she left me a beautiful segue into the closing of our action matching our words. That is what ought to happen, and when that does not happen, people get pretty cynical. Let me refer to some words.  In 1996, Newt Gingrich was the Speaker of this House and he said, ``The current system is indefensible,'' referring to the tax code. He was right. ``It is riddled with special interest tax breaks. Today's tax code is so complex that many Americans despair that only someone with an advanced degree in rocket science could figure it out. They are wrong. Even a certified genius such as Albert Einstein needed help in figuring out this Form 1040.'' In 1996, 8 years ago, the Republicans were in charge of this House, and Mr. Gingrich was our Speaker.  A year later, Mr. Gingrich said this as the Speaker of the House, ``So we want to move towards a simpler tax code that takes less time to fill out, that is easier for the American people,'' 1997.  In the last 7 years, the Speaker's party, the Republican party, has made the tax code 25 percent more complicated than it was in 1997, moving in exactly the opposite direction.  In 2001, 4 years later, 2001, President Bush said, Americans want our tax code to be reasonable and simple and fair. He was absolutely right. That is what I want. That is what every American wants. These are goals that have shaped my plan. What plan? No plan, no plan here, no plan in the Committee on Ways and Means, no plan from the White House.                              {time}  2045  And then in 2004, fast forward 3 years, just last year: ``The administration has made tax simplification a priority, and we look forward to working with Congress to achieve it. A simpler code is something we owe honest taxpayers, and the worst thing of all for the tax cheat.''  Mr. Speaker, we agree with the President, but what did we do today? This very day, we made the Tax Code more complicated, not to mention costing many small farmers and small businessmen more money than they otherwise would have paid with existing policy.  Mr. Speaker, my Republican friends, my Democratic friends, on behalf of the Democratic Party, I pledge that we are going to fight to reform a system that is complicated, that is unfair, and that is inefficient so that Americans will say, as painful as April 15 may be, at least it was easier to fill out, at least I think it was fair, and at least I think it will be handled in an efficient way.  Democrats are committed to reforming this Tax Code so it will be simpler, fairer, and more efficient.                          ____________________
