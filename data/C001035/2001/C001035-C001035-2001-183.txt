                          AMENDMENT NO. 174  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, to move the budget process forward, I voted to support the Grassley amendment today to raise the levels of spending for agriculture programs in the budget resolution. Despite my favorable vote, I wish to express my deep concerns about the form and level of spending included in this amendment.  The Grassley amendment will add an additional $63 billion in mandatory spending to agricultural programs over ten years, which is assumed to be paid from projected budget surpluses. This is above the amount proposed by my Republican colleagues on the budget committee. By designating the extra $63 billion as mandatory spending, much of this funding will be targeted toward farm subsidy programs.  The needs of American family farmers are not being ignored. Congress is in the process of drafting a new Farm bill to reauthorize USDA programs, which many would view as the appropriate vehicle to tackle necessary reform and address farm crises. In the past few years, Congress has approved more than $20 billion in emergency farm aid for crop losses and disaster assistance. The agriculture appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001 was padded with $300 million in porkbarrel spending for towns, universities, research institutes and a myriad of other entities. This is already an exorbitant commitment by the American taxpayer.  I believe it is fundamentally wrong that we are asking taxpayers to pay billions more, above already inflated levels of spending for farm programs and subsidies, particularly when the federal government is not meeting its current obligations for other designated mandatory spending programs such as education. For example, this budget resolution does not account for the federal government's responsibility to pay 40 percent of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, for special education. I believe many of my colleagues would agree that we should prioritize mandatory spending for existing responsibilities not being fulfilled without requiring the taxpayers to spend an additional $63 billion for farm programs that have already been more than compensated.  After consultation with the leadership on this particular amendment, my colleagues stated that if Senator Grassley's amendment failed, many would be in the position of having to vote for the Johnson amendment, which would have raised mandatory spending on agriculture programs by $97 billion, as the only available alternative. Therefore, while I believe this to be irresponsible fiscal policy, I ultimately decided to vote in favor of the Grassley amendment to move the process forward on the budget resolution and to avoid even greater wasteful spending. I remind my colleagues, however, that we still have an important obligation to American taxpayers to ensure that any spending we approve through the annual appropriations process pursuant to this budget resolution is fair, fiscally responsible, and targeted at those truly in need.
