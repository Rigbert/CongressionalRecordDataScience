President, I rise today to introduce the Central American and Haitian Parity Act of 1999 with my colleague Senator Kennedy. This legislation will provide deserved and needed relief to thousands of immigrants from Central America and the Caribbean who came to the United States fleeing political persecution.  In the 1980's, thousands of Salvadorans and Guatemalans fled civil wars in their countries and sought asylum in the United States. The vast majority had been persecuted or feared persecution in their home countries. The people of Honduras had a similar experience. While civil war was not formally waged within Honduras, the geography of the region made it impossible for Honduras to be unaffected by the violence and turmoil that surrounded it. The country of Haiti has also experienced extreme upheaval. Haitians for many years were forced to seek the protection of the United States because of oppression, human rights abuses and civil unrest.  Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Haitians and Hondurans have now established roots in the United States. Some have married here and many have children that were born in the United States. Yet many still live in fear. They cannot easily leave the United States and return to the great uncertainty in their countries of origin. If they are forced to return, they will face enormous hardship. Their former homes are either occupied by strangers or not there at all. The people they once knew are gone and so are the jobs they need to support their families. They also cannot become permanent residents of the United States, which severely limits their opportunities for work and education. This situation is unacceptable and requires a more permanent solution.  Before outlining how this bill will provide a permanent solution, it is important to review the evolution of deportation remedies. Prior to the passage of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Responsibility Act in 1996, aliens in the United States could apply for suspension of deportation and adjustment of status in order to obtain lawful permanent residence. Suspension of deportation was used to ameliorate the harsh consequences of deportation for aliens who had been present in the United States for long periods of time.  In September of 1996, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Responsibility Act. This law retroactively made thousands of immigrants ineligible for suspension of deportation and left them with no alternate remedy. The 1996 Act eliminated suspension of deportation and established a new form of relief entitled cancellation of removal that required an applicant to accrue ten years of continuous residence as of the date of the initial notice charging the applicant with being removable.  In 1997, this Congress recognized that these new provisions could result in grave injustices to certain groups of people. So in November of 1997, the Nicaraguan and Central American Relief Act (NACARA) granted relief to certain citizens of former Soviet block countries and several Central American countries. This select group of immigrants were allowed to apply for permanent residence under the old, pre-IIRRA standards.  Such an alteration of IIRRA made sense. After all, the U.S. had allowed Central Americans to reside and work here for over a decade, during which time many of them established families, careers and community ties. The complex history of civil wars and political persecution in parts of Central America left thousands of people in limbo without a place to call home. Many victims of severe persecution came to the United States with very strong asylum cases, but unfortunately these individuals have waited so long for a hearing they will have difficulty proving their cases because they involve incidents which occurred as early as 1980. In addition, many victims of persecution never filed for asylum out of fear of denial, and consequently these people now face claims weakened by years of delay.  Mr. President, the bill I introduce today is a necessary and fair expansion of NACARA. It provides a permanent solution for thousands of people who desperately need one. Specifically, the bill amends the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act and provides nationals of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Haiti an opportunity to apply for adjustment of status under the same standards as Nicaraguans and Cubans. While the restoration of democracy in Central America and the Caribbean has been encouraging, the situation remains delicate. Providing immigrants from these politically volatile areas an opportunity to apply for permanent resident status in the United States instead of deporting them to politically and economically fragile countries will provide more stability in the long run. Such an approach is the best solution not only for the United States but also for new and fragile democracies in Central America and the Caribbean. Immigrants have greatly contributed to the United States, both economically and culturally and the people of Central America and the Caribbean are no exception. If we continue to deny them a chance to live in the United States by deporting them, we not only hurt them, we hurt us too.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1592       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
