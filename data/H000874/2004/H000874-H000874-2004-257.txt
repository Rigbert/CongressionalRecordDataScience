Speaker, I wanted to do a Special Order today that I will not be able to do, but I join the gentleman from California (Mr. Honda) and the rest of my colleagues on the occasion of Asian American Heritage Month. During this month, we celebrate the important contributions Asian Pacific Americans have made to our great country.  The gentleman from California (Mr. Honda) is head of the Asian Pacific Caucus, and the gentleman has helped all of us learn more about the concerns and issues facing Asian Americans and the Pacific Islander community, and I salute the gentleman's work on these issues.  More importantly, I thank every Asian American for the extraordinary contribution they have made to this country. I have a list which I will not have time to read, but it will be included in the Record.  Mr. Speaker, suffice it to say I am pleased that the gentleman from California (Mr. Honda) took out this very appropriate Special Order to honor Asian Americans during Asian American Heritage Month.                          ____________________
