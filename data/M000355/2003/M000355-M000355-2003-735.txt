 President, we will shortly resume consideration of S. 1, the prescription drug benefits bill. We have been in discussion with the distinguished assistant Democratic leader about votes later this morning. We hope to be able to have an announcement shortly about when the votes will commence. Obviously we will stay on this bill all day today. We will be finishing it this week, hopefully Thursday night. We are going to press forward and encourage Members to continue to offer their amendments. We will try to get votes as rapidly as we can.
