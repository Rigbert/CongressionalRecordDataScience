Speaker, does the gentleman have any thoughts at this point in time regarding the length of time of the initial CR that we would consider? I yield to my friend.  Mr. DeLAY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. No, I have not been advised by the Committee on Appropriations as to what they are thinking. I am sure they will start having those discussions with the Senate and the gentleman's leadership starting next week, because we are going to have to deal with that issue.
