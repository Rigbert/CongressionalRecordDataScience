Speaker, I want to thank the distinguished gentleman from Ohio for yielding me this time. I would say to my colleagues that I rise in opposition to the rule and I urge my colleagues to vote against the bill. For me, this is a very sad day personally, I think it is a sad day for our committee, it is a sad day for this institution, and it is really a sad day for the people that this bill is meant to assist, the farmers in rural communities across this country that are being pounded by the lowest prices in the last decade and a half, and by horrendous weather conditions.  Now, why do I ask my colleagues to vote against the rule and this bill? I believe that if we do this, the leadership of this institution--that should feel very bad about what it has done in this bill--the President of the United States, and the rest of the membership of this institution will do what is necessary to meet the needs of the farmers and rural dwellers of this country.  Let me tell my colleagues what the process has done over the last week and a half. I have been here 17 years. This has never happened in a committee on which I have served. Twice last week we were recessed because the majority could not reach agreement on some of the amendments that our committee was duly debating. And so we were sent out into the woods, and we were never called back. And all of a sudden the deal began to be brokered in the offices of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay) and Speaker Hastert. There were a lot of special interests that were accommodated as these discussions ensued, but the truth is that the needs of the American people were shelved as people took care of their regional interests.  I do not have a problem with milk. I do not have a problem with citrus. I do not have a problem with hogs or specialty crops or corn or wheat or beans. But the issue is really bigger than that. The issue really is, will all interests of this country get a fair hearing in the normal committee process? That has not happened. This rule and bill were discussed after midnight last night up in the chambers here. Who was really present to hear that? And members of our committees never even had the text of the bill. Now, at some point, somebody has to say, stop, this game ought to be over.  Members of our committee were appointed in good faith by the members of this institution to discharge our duties. We have a crisis situation in rural America where today the suicide rate is three times as great as it is in urban America. The pain is really deep. So we have even more of an obligation to produce a bill that meets the needs of our country. I do not have a bone to pick with our chairman, the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Skeen), because his members were divested of their power, too, and that is not how this institution should work. Who is reallyafraid of open debate? Who is really afraid of that, and letting the normal committee process work?  Let me just say, what are some of the issues that should have been brought up, that cannot be brought up under the process under this tourniquet rule and narrow-focused process that we have been forced to go through? We should be talking about targeting this assistance to the people that really need the help. At least 20 percent of the assistance that is in this bill is going to go to people that really do not need it. And people who really need it are not going to be able to get it because we have not had an opportunity to amend. People who serve on the Committee on the Budget ought to be concerned about that. Somebody ought to be taking a look at these formulas. We never had a chance to debate that in our committee.                              {time}  1015  Now, what about adequate financing for victims of hurricanes and natural disasters across our country? This bill is a fig leaf for them. Yesterday in the Labor HHS appropriations the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price) whose district is devastated was able to tuck in an additional $500 million in a Labor, Health, and Human Services appropriation bill to try to make up for what is not in this bill. Procedurally we cannot wed those two bills on this floor today, but that was just another sign of how inadequate this bill really is.  The question really is, is it just North Carolina that needs help? What about the bill's inadequacies in terms of covering those who raise apples or specialty crops or vegetables or happen to be in the livestock industry like up in my part of the country, in the hog industry where they are on their knees? Are they second class producers, that they do not get in this bill? They did not get in the room with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hastert)? Somehow they were not in the line? Should we close our eyes to their needs? Are we really going to take care of the fundamental problem here, which is low prices and bad weather? There are not provisions in this bill really to clear our markets and to lift commodities off these markets through humanitarian shipments and monetized sales to other countries at the level that is necessary to begin to give some easing in prices in the markets here at home.  So, this bill will not meet the needs of our country. We do not have any measure before us that will prevent the very same kind of chaos today next year in the market. If I look at the numbers, in the Commodity Credit Corporation over the last few years, we have spent more in this year trying to plug holes in Freedom to Farm. Rather, we should be going back and altering that, adding to it, changing it so we are not hemorrhaging in terms of the budget next year in trying to plug the holes in the dike in rural America.  Just in this year alone, 1999, we will spend $18.4 billion to try to make up for the insufficiencies of Freedom to Farm. People are worried about Social Security and everything else, and Mr. Speaker, I can tell my colleagues the bill before us today is not going to do a thing to change the fundamentals.  There were a host of other provisions that Members wanted us to debate and, on the merits, vote up or down in the committee. We never had a chance to do that. On economic sanctions relative to countries like Cuba and others in the Middle East, in Africa, there was a royal debate. And it should have continued, and we should have had a right to vote. That did not happen. The democratic process was squelched by the leadership of this institution.  In addition to that, we had Members who wanted to offer provisions dealing with protection of the American people on imported meats, making sure they were inspected and that plants were licensed in other places. Guess what? They never had a chance to bring those provisions up.  What about poultry inspections and all the outbreaks that we have had across this country in salmonella and trying to get amendments in here to deal with the health and safety of the American people? Could not do it. Those were squelched too. Those Members left the committee room as we were asked to leave.  Again I want to say we have no criticism of the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Skeen). And I do not have any criticism of our subcommittee staff because they were poised to do a good job, but they were disposed of their duties. In many ways they are victims like the rest of us.  My parents always said to do good, do not ignore the needs of others if you hope that some day they will respond when you have needs of your own. This vital life lesson got lost in this whole process.
