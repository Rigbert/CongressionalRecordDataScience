Speaker, I rise to inquire of the majority leader the schedule for the week to come.  I will say at the beginning when the majority leader got up to ask unanimous consent, I thought maybe something had happened and he was going to ask unanimous consent to have me give him the schedule. But hope springs eternal.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?
