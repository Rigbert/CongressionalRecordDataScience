President, there is a reason, when you look at Judge Shedd's record, that many believe he has a reputation for assisting the defense in civil cases and for ruling for the defense in employment civil rights cases, for example. His holding in Condon v. Reno shows that his view of the constitutional allocation of powers between the States and the, Federal Government goes even beyond what we have seen from a very conservative activist Supreme Court across the street. They are busily rewriting the law in this fundamental area. And Judge Shedd goes beyond the U.S. Supreme Court. His actions in a case involving serious prosecutorial and police misconduct also raise serious questions about his fairness in criminal cases.  His record as a whole raises serious concerns about whether he should be elevated to a court that is only one step below the U.S. Supreme Court and whether he should be entrusted with deciding appeals there.  Every litigant, every defendant, every person, every plaintiff who comes before a judge in the Federal courts must be assured that the judge will give a fair and unbiased hearing to the case at hand. The test of a judge, especially a lifetime appointment, goes beyond just the question of competence. When we are talking about our Federal courts--remember, our Federal courts are admired around the world for their independence and their fairness, but that means that whether you or I, or anybody else walks into a Federal court, no matter what our case is, whether we are plaintiff or a defendant, whether we are the Government or one responding to the Government, whether we are rich or poor, no matter what our political background is, when we walk into the courtroom door, we have to be able to have confidence that this judge, this Federal judge, will hear our case--he or she will hear it fairly.  Litigants in our federal courts should be able to have confidence to say and believe that it makes no difference what my political background is, what the color of my skin is, where I am from, or anything else. I will win or I will lose based on the merits of the case, not based on the individual prejudices of the judge.  Unfortunately, when one looks at Judge Shedd's record, one has to say that somebody coming in to his court could not have that assurance. One has to say unless they fit into a narrow category that Judge Shedd has routinely favored in his cases, you are probably pretty unlucky to be before his court.  Let me go through these concerns in a little more detail. First, Judge Shedd has a reputation for assisting in the defense in civil cases, raising issues sua sponte (on his own motion, without a motion from the lawyers for the litigants), in essence making himself the third litigator and not leaving it up to the parties--the plaintiff or defendant--to litigate the case, but actually stepping in and taking sides and making it very clear to the people in the courtroom that he is taking sides.  He has ordered defendants to make motions for summary judgment whether they wanted or planned to or not. He has resolved issues before they are even raised and fully briefed, having made up his mind before the case is even heard, having made up his mind on behalf of one of the litigants. This shows a pattern of a judge injecting himself into litigation, particularly in the shoes of corporations and others if they are being sued, if they are defendants in civil litigation. Here are some specific cases that illustrate these interventions by Judge Shedd to the benefit of one of the parties.  In McCarter v. RHNB, a case alleging gender discrimination, Judge Shedd granted summary judgment. He did not even wait for the company to raise these grounds. He raised it for them and summarily ruled in their behalf on an issue they had not even raised.  In Shults v. Denny's Restaurant, a case involving a claims of employment discrimination under the Americans with Disabilties Act, Judge Shedd raised an issue on his own, saying he was doing it ``for possible resolution by summary judgment.'' In other words, putting himself on the side of Denny's and in essence advocating for their interests.  Again, deciding how best the defense should execute their litigation strategy, he noted that three of the defenses asserted are potentially dispositive of certain claims--in other words, three of the defenses could settle the case right there--and said ``these issues do not appear to necessitate much, if any, discovery on the part of the plaintiff.'' He mentioned, almost as an afterthought at the close of his order, that defendants ``may also file a memorandum'' if they want.  It does not help when you are litigating a case if you know the judge has already made up his mind for the other side. It helps even less if, having made it clear he has made up his mind for the other side, he actually steps in and helps the other side.  What kind of an image does that give to people who are expecting fairness and impartiality in our Federal courts? What does that say to people who are being told by all of us, as we always are, that our Federal courts are impartial? What does it say when they watch cases being tried by a judge who takes sides openly and clearly and continuously in his courtroom?  In Lowery v. Seamless Sensations, a case where an African American woman brought claims under Title VII for employment discrimination on the basis of race, Judge Shedd turned to the person she was suing and said: Make a motion to dismiss. Then he quickly granted it. I bet you that woman walked out of there wondering why she ever even bothered coming into court when it was so obvious the judge made up his mind.  Take Coker v. Wal-Mart, in which it appears the judge wanted to get rid of this case. He wanted to make a motion on his own to send it back to the State court, but he did ask Wal-Mart: Give me a memo to show me I can really do that which, of course, is what Wal-Mart wanted.  In Gilmore v. Ford Motor Company, a product liability case, Judge Shedd outlined four factors he must consider before dismissing an action for failure to prosecute. He found that the defendants had not set forth evidence addressing these four factors, but nevertheless went on to ``glean certain pertinent information from the record.''  In other words, he said: Here is what you need to win this case. You have not raised these issues yourself. I have gleaned them from somewhere in the record. So do not worry, buddies, Ihave taken care of you; I am on your side. I will argue your case for you and, in doing this, I can dismiss the case against you.  You almost wonder if the winning side feels they should pay their attorneys when the judge has stepped in to help them win the case.  In Simmons v. Coastal Contractors, both parties were appearing without a lawyer, or pro se. Judge Shedd noted that ``this civil action . . . is before the court sua sponte.'' While he must have meant the motion itself was before him sua sponte, or on his own motion, he brought up deficiencies in the plaintiff's complaint and ordered that an amended complaint be filed or the action would be dismissed on the judge's own motion. In other words, he essentially indicated I am going to decide the case. You litigants go have coffee if you want, but I am going to make up my mind, make your arguments for you, and settle the case for you.  In another substitution for his strategic litigation judgment for that of the defendants, Tessman v. Island Ford-Lincoln-Mercury, Judge Shedd threatened to dismiss the plaintiff's Title VII action on his own unless the plaintiff could show cause why he should not. He said the plaintiff had not alleged that she had presented her claim to, or received a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC and decided that rather than letting the defense move for dismissal, he would do so on his own. In other words: I am going to make the arguments on the other side and get rid of the case.  Additionally, of the 11 cases relating to employment discrimination available in the public record, Judge Shedd held for the employer in every single one, including one case where he sat by designation on the Fourth Circuit. Judge Shedd granted summary judgment after summary judgment and found for the employer and against the employee in a wide range of employment discrimination claims.  Of the 54 fair employment cases included in the unpublished opinions he provided to the Committee, more than 80 percent of them grant summary judgment to the defendants. That does not appear to be a fair record. It strongly indicates plaintiffs are not receiving fair hearings. Employment cases are often fact-specific disputes that would not seem likely to result in an overwhelming majority of summary judgment decisions for defendants because under the summary judgment standard, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-movant--the plaintiff under these circumstances--and the judge must find that there are no disputes about material facts and that judgment as a matter of law is warranted for the moving party the defendants.  Certainly when I look at the mail I get from South Carolina and from litigants and others there, there is a pervasive feeling that unless you fit the right category when you come before that court, you are not going to get a hearing favorable to you--actually, an overwhelming feeling that the hearings will not be fair. They will be slanted to one side. That is not how we maintain the integrity and independence of the Federal bench. For example, the National Employment Lawyers Association reviewed Judge Shedd's public record. They sent a letter opposing his confirmation. I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                               National Employment                                          Lawyers Association,                                               September 17, 2002.     Re Dennis Sheed--Appointee for United States Court of          Appeals.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: On behalf of the National Employment      Lawyers Association (NELA), I am writing you to express our      organization's strong opposition to the nomination of Judge      Dennis Shedd to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. We urge      the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to vote against      his nomination. We further urge the Administration to      nominate a person for that seat who will apply federal      employment and labor laws in a fair and even-handed manner,      and who will interpret those laws in keeping with the intent      of Congress.     during his hearing, judge shedd offered misleading information       Judge Shedd's employment law decisions have been, almost      without exception, in favor of employers. At his Committee      hearing earlier this year, Judge Shedd claimed that was      unable to recall any employment case in his courtroom that      had gone to trial resulted in a verdict or judgment in favor      of the plaintiff. By way of explanation, Judge Shedd told the      Committee that no judge in his district had an employment      case where the employee had won at trial. This statement was      untrue, and several other judges in the district presided      over trials which were won by the plaintiffs. Shedd's      statement is not only indicative of his anti-employee bias,      but also demonstrates a cavalier attitude toward the truth      and a willingness to offer erroneous information to the      Committee.       In addition, NELA is concerned that Judge Shedd may not      have opened his entire judicial record for scrutiny by the      Senate Judiciary Committee and the public. Shedd turned over      unpublished opinions only after his hearing, and never      provided the Committee with a full docket of his cases.      Without a full docket, it is impossible to determine whether      all of Judge Shedd's unpublished opinions have been released.      Your Committee is considering Judge Shedd's lifetime      appointment to a court where his rulings would carry enormous      precedential force. In light of the importance of this      appointment, the Committee and the full Senate should not      be forced to make a decision based on a record that may be      incomplete. judge shedd's employment decisions reveal a strong anti-employee bias       NELA has analyzed dozens of Judge Shedd's unpublished and      published decisions in employment cases. These decisions      reveal a willingness to bend the law and ignore precedent in      order to reach results-oriented rulings.judge shedd frequently ignored the findings of his own magistrate judge                    in order to rule against employees       In the federal district courts, Magistrate Judges often      evaluate a case and recommend to the judge whether the      plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence for the case to      go to trial. The decisions of Magistrate Judges are typically      affirmed, as the Magistrate Judge usually has had an      opportunity to fully review the facts of the case. Judge      Shedd has frequently ignored uncontradicted evidence and      overruled the recommendations of Magistrate Judges.       In Cleary v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., the      Magistrate Judge has found that there was sufficient evidence      for a trial where a female employee was fired in retaliation      for filing a sexual harassment case. The employer forced the      female employee to take administrative leave and then fired      her after she filed a sexual harassment claim, but the      harasser was allowed to keep working. Judge Shedd rejected      the Magistrate Judge's recommendation, and refused to let the      case go to trial. By viewing each of the seven or eight      incidents of harassment as a separate incident rather than as      a whole, Judge Shedd concluded that there was no evidence      that the female employee was forced to take leave and then      terminated for retaliatory reasons (contrary to the      Magistrate Judge's findings). Judge Shedd's analysis--viewing      each incident in isolation--is contrary to established      Supreme Court precedent. Judge Shedd also excused some of the      defendant's acts as mere ``mistakes.''       In Dinkins v. Blackman, Judge Shedd rejected a magistrate      Judge's recommendation and granted summary judgment on a      sexual harassment claim and other claims by the employee,      even though Judge Shedd found that the sexual harassment was      ``gross behavior.'' Judge Shedd refused to give the employee      the opportunity to seek further information for her case in      discovery, ignoring a new Supreme Court case which was      decided after Dinkins filed her case.       In Ellis v. Speaks Oil Co., Judge Shedd granted summary      judgment in favor of the employer on an age discrimination      claim, contrary to the Magistrate Judge's recommendation,      because he concluded that the plaintiff, a truck driver, was      not performing his duties up to his employer's expectations      of driving two trips per day. He disregarded evidence found      by the Magistrate Judge which showed that the plaintiff, who      was 62 years old, was driving two trips per day until the      company let him go.       In Roberts v. Defender Services, Judge Shedd ignored the      Magistrate Judge's recommendation to deny the employer's      motion for summary judgment in a sexual harassment case.      Judge Shedd agreed that the harassment in this case was      severe, but ruled that the woman did not prove that she was      really upset by the harassment, which should have been a      question for the jury to decide.judge shedd ignored clear and established precedent in order to rule in        favor of corporate employers against individual employees       In Ephraim v. Paul Harris Stores, Inc., Judge Shedd held      that a claim of invasion of privacy (false light) was not      cognizable under South Carolina law, despite two South      Caroline Supreme Court decisions that had recognized this as      a valid claim under state law.       In Rector v. Rainbow Shops, Inc., Judge Shedd disregarded      South Carolina state-court decisions that had held that a      mere insinuation is actionable in a defamation case if it is      false and malicious and the meaning is plain. Instead, he      decided that employee's termination while the store was      experiencing cash shortages was not reasonably capable of     a defamatory meaning. Judge Shedd also allowed the employer      to read and sign the form, even though the employer offered      no reason for doing this. Judge Shedd did not even require      the employer to explain why it was necessary for the      termination meeting to occur in public, in the presence of      other store employees.       In Storms v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., Judge Shedd held      that an employee could not bring a claim for breach of      contract based on language contained in the company's own      personnel documents because there was no evidence of ``mutual      assent'' to those documents. He did not explain why the      company had not assented to the promises contained in its own      documents. He refused to follow precedent by the South      Carolina Supreme Court on this and related issues. Later, in      Truesdale v. Dana Corp., Judge Shedd cited his own opinion in      Storms and again failed to follow precedent. In this case, an      employee was fired in violation of the company's own      disciplinary policies and procedures. By interpreting the      employer's personnel documents in a selective, extremely pro-     employer manner, Judge Shedd determined that the employer's      policies did not protect the employee.  judge shedd disregarded or misconstrued evidence to the benefit of                                employers       In English v. Kennecott Ridgeway Mining Co., an injured      employee claimed that he was fired in retaliation for filing      a workers' compensation claim. Judge Shedd dismissed the      retaliatory discharge claim despite uncontradicted evidence      (summarized in his own opinion) which demonstrated the      employer's hostility toward the injured worker because of his      workers' compensation claim. In fact, while the plaintiff      ``was still under the care of the company's physician,      coworkers informed English that his superiors were      complaining that English was milking the system, that he was      not really hurt, and that he should be returned to full      duty.''       In Givens v. South Carolina Health Insurance Pool, Judge      Shedd allowed the state insurance pool to exclude AIDS/HIV      from health insurance coverage. Judge Shedd held that the      Sec. 501(c) insurance underwriting exclusion (safe harbor      provision) of the Americans with Disabilities Act (``ADA'')      exempted the Insurance pool from coverage under that statute,      even though the State did not do any of its own actuarial      studies or underwriting studies to evaluate the expensive and      risks of insuring persons with AIDS/HIV. Since the State      failed to do any of its own studies, it should have been      barred from being able to claim the Sec. 501(c) exemption.       In Gregory v. Chester County Sheriff's Dept., Judge Shedd      accepted a poorly reasoned recommendation from a Magistrate      Judge against an employee. The Magistrate Judge had found      that the employee could not prove that her demotion was an      ``adverse action'' by the employer. This ruling is contrary      to precedent that demotions are adverse job actions. Gurganus      v. Beneficial North Carolina, Inc., 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS      26943 (4th Cir. 2000). Although Judge Shedd stated that he      was supposed to review the Magistrate Judge's recommendation      de novo, he issued only a one-page summary order.       In Richberg v. Glaston Copper Recycling, Judge Shedd      refused to consider evidence presented by the plaintiff that      showed the existence of genuine issues of material fact when      he granted summary judgment for the employer. For example, he      claimed that the plaintiff had failed to challenge the      employer's affirmative defense that the plaintiff was      terminated for failing to meet ``established work      standards,'' although the plaintiff had submitted a positive      performance evaluation from his personnel file. Judge Shedd      also refused to follow a state court decision that had held      that a sixteen-day proximity in time between a workers'      compensation filing and a drug screen was prima facie      retaliation, on the grounds that the drug screen in the      Richberg case was ordered 50 days after the filing. judge shedd's appointment to the fourth circuit would stack the court                         with pro-employer judges       NELA members who practice in the states within the Fourth      Circuit repeatedly have reported that they do everything they      can to avoid filing employment cases in federal court and      avoid filing federal claims in state court, for fear of      removal. As a result, federal statutes prohibiting      discrimination in employment--Title VII, the ADA, the Age      Discrimination in Employment Act, the Reconstruction-era      civil rights acts--are largely not enforced in those states      because the Fourth Circuit has created a hostile environment      for those claims. As Committee members are aware, the Fourth      Circuit has been reversed even by the current Supreme Court      on a number of occasions, in cases involving employment and      other matters. See, e.g., EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., 534      U.S. 279 (2002) (reversing the Fourth Circuit decision by a      6-3 vote, and holding that the EEOC is not bound by      arbitration agreements between an employee and employer);      Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 531 U.S. 67 (2001) (by a 6-3      vote, holding that coerced drug testing of pregnant women is      unconstitutional); Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428      (2000) (by a 7-2 vote, the Court refused to overrule Miranda      v. Arizona).         nela strongly opposes the confirmation of judge shedd       Judge Shedd's record shows a cavalier attitude toward      evidence, legal precedent, and an alarming tendency to deny      working men and women who appear before him their day in      court. Judge Shedd is dismissive toward the rights of workers      who face harassment and mistreatment by their employers.      Unlike his colleagues in the District of South Carolina,      there has never been a pro-employee verdict in any civil      rights trial in Judge Shedd's courtroom. If fairness and a      commitment to equal justice are expected of appointees to the      United States Court of Appeals, then Judge Shedd has proven      that he cannot satisfy these expectations. For these reasons,      NELA urges you to oppose the confirmation of Judge Dennis      Shedd.           Very truly yours,                                              Frederick M. Gittes,               President, National Employment Lawyers Association.
