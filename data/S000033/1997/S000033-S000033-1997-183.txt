 Kucinich]. As the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Bonior] knows, 23 years ago the United States led the world in terms of the wages and benefits our workers received. Today, as a result of a number of factors, not least of which is our absurd trade policy, we are now in 13th place as a result in terms of wages and benefits. The fact of the matter is that the average American today is working longer hours for lower wages and they need that extra time in order to compensate for the decline in their income.  Clearly, there is something very wrong when from one end of this country to the other, we are seeing the loss of good paying manufacturing jobs and the substitution of those jobs in the service industry which pays people $6 an hour, $7 an hour, and often does not have benefits.  So I think that probably the most important issue that this Congress should be debating is to demand in one way or another, and I have somethoughts on it, you and Mr. Kucinich have thoughts on it, in one way or another we have got to tell corporate America who have made their money in this country that they have got to begin reinvesting in Vermont, in Michigan, in Ohio, back into the United States of America, put people to work at decent wages, rather than running all over the world to hire desperately poor people at starvation wages.  I am happy to yield to the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Kucinich].
