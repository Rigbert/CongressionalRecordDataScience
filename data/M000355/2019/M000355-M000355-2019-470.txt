 President, later today, in the old Senate Chamber, family, friends, and former colleagues of our late colleague, Senator Ted Stevens, will gather for the unveiling of the Senator's leadership portrait.  Senator Stevens' likeness will join the storied ranks of the leadership portrait collection--images of majority leaders, minority leaders, and Presidents pro tem, which are proudly displayed around the building.  Our distinguished predecessors watch over the corridors they walked, the rooms in which they debated, and the body they served.  It is fitting that Senator Stevens is being recognized for his service as President pro tem. As we all know, unlike the elected party leaders, that is not a job which you can campaign or persuade your way into. The only way to become President pro tem is to persuade your home State, over and over, to rehire you, and Ted Stevens was about the most dogged advocate for his home State that anybody could possibly imagine. He was Alaska's son and Alaska's champion 24 hours a day and then some.  I look forward to honoring our former colleague's memory this afternoon.                          ____________________
