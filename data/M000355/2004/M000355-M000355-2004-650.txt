 President, as my colleagues know, freedom in Burma has long been under siege by a military junta calling itself the State Peace and Department Council (SPDC). In response to last year's brutal assault against the supporters of the National League for Democracy NLD, and its leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Congress quickly passed--and the President signed into law--the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003.  This was an appropriate response to an act of Terrorism orchestrated and carried out buy the SPDC and its affiliated organizations.  Last week, the State Department issued its annual human rights report, and the section on Burma evidences egregious and systematic human rights abuses. Let me read one excerpt from that report:     [the SPDC's] extremely poor human rights record worsened, and      it continued to commit numerous serious abuses. Citizens      still did not have the right to change their government.      Security forces continued to commit extrajudical killings and      rape, forcibly relocate persons, use forced labor, conscript      child soldiers, and reestablished forced conscription of the      civilian population into militia units.  Murder, rape, forced labor, child soldiers . . . this is a sobering reminder of how egregious and extreme human rights violations are in Burma.  While many in Burma's neighborhood raised concerns with the situation in that country, including Malaysia andIndonesia, Thailand--led by Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra--seemed keen on letting the wind out of sanction sails at every opportunity. This strikes me as odd behavior given Thailand's processed commitment to democracy and human rights.  Where others speak out to demand concrete actions from the SPDC, including the unconditional and immediate release of Suu Kyi and her compatriots, Thaksin has repeatedly risen to defend those who Secretary Powell referred to as ``murderous thugs''.  Last year, he initiated an international forum on Burma self-dubbed the ``Bangkok Process'' that did not include the NLD, the United States, or other proven champions of freedom. However, it did include the SPDC, and was described the Thaksin as a meeting of the ``like minded.'' The ``Bangkok Process'' is fundamentally flawed by the very absence of Suu Kyi and her supporters at the table. Tellingly, they remain under arrest and detention in Burma.  I agree with Norwegian Foreign Minister Jan Petersen that ``all voices in the country had to be heard and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi must be released.'' In stark contrast, Thaksin recently stated, ``Burma is on the right track. . . . If they follow our recommendations, they will be okay and get everything done.''  With narcotics, HIV/AIDS and other undesirable exports pouring across Burma's borders into Thailand, it is only fair to question Thaksin's motivations in his cozy relationship with the SPDC. Some suspect that the raison d'etre can be summed up in a single word: iPSTAR.  iPSTAR is a $350 million broadband satellite owned by Shin Satellite, Sattel, and Shin Corporation, a holding company created by the Prime Minister that owns 53 percent of Sattel. If successfully launched and operational, the satellite will beam its signal across Asia.  To convince doubting Thomases who suspect that Thailand's approach to Burma may be based on selfish profit--not principle--Thaksin should answer the following single question:  What investments, including projects and activities related to iPSTAR, do Shin Satellite and Shin Corporation have in Burma, and/or have planned for Burma?  I intend to pose this same question to Secretary of State Colin Powell when he appears before the Foreign Operations Subcommittee next month.  Let me close by saying that many of us remain concerned with the continued deterioration of democratic institutions in Thailand--including a free and independent press. We are alarmed and distressed by continued reports of the deportation of as many as 10,000 Burmese refugees, exiles, and migrant workers from Thailand to Burma each month. My colleagues can find additional information on this matter in a February 25th article by Ellen Nakashima in the Washington Post and through Human Rights Watch's report ``Out of Sight, Out of Mind: Thai Policy Toward Burmese Refugees and Migrants.''  With rising tensions in the south, it is more important that ever that Thailand stay the course in its political and legal development.  I am sure my colleagues will agree that accountability and transparency must be maintained in Thailand, be it a crackdown on drugs or business with Burma. As the last few weeks have clearly demonstrated, Thai politicians are quick to promise a chicken in every pot--but sometimes chickens get the flu. I say this only to illustrate my hopes that Prime Minister Thaksin has prepared an alternative approach toward Burma and the SPDC that includes the full participation and input of Suu Kyi and the NLD as well as all ethnic nationalities.  I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks an article from Thailand's English language newspaper The Nation be printed in the Record. Thaksin has it wrong--the United States is not a ``useless friend'' to Thailand. On the contrary, America is a strong advocate of democracy and human rights throughout the region.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    [From The Nation, Feb. 28, 2004]       Reaction to US Rights Report: ``You're a Useless Friend''       Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra yesterday slammed the      United States as a ``useless friend'' for issuing a damning      report on the deterioration of human rights here. ``It's      unacceptable to me the way the US came out with the report by      citing media reports. What kind of friend are they?'' a      fuming Thaksin said. ``Once every year, the US comes out and      damages the reputation of its friend. What would they do if      Thailand issued the same [kind of] report?'' Thaksin told      reporters that although Thailand has been in discussions with      the US on the human rights situation here the US produced a      report that differed from the information Thailand supplied.       The US State Department yesterday released its annual      country-by-country review of human rights. Thailand's record      ``worsened'' last year as a result of the extra-judicial      killings and arbitrary arrests during the first round of the      war on drugs, from February to April, the report said. ``I      have to say bluntly that it [the US report] really annoyed      me. I have asked the Foreign Ministry to issue a statement,''      Thaksin said.       The Foreign Ministry ``invited'' US Ambassador Darryl      Johnson to receive an official complaint. Foreign Minister      Surakiart Sathirathai said: ``It has been like this for at      least three times during my time [as foreign minister]. We      feel that it is something that is not healthy for close      allies like the US and Thailand.'' In what appeared to be an      attempt by the ministry to maximize media coverage of the      summoning of Johnson, photographers were asked to position      themselves in what is usually an off-limits area. The      ministry issued a statement on Thursday expressing its ``deep      disappointment'' over the report, saying it contained      ``serious inaccuracies''--particularly on the government's      anti-drugs campaign--and overstated the toll from summary      killings.       ``The report does not provide a balanced account of the      facts, even though the Thai government has gone to great      lengths to provide all the information to the US side,'' the      statement read. This was also the case for the reports in      2002 and 2001, when Thailand had to pinpoint various factual      errors and the US apologized and admitted that the reports      were done in haste, Surakiart claimed. Such a report is      ``useless'' for the governments as well as the public and it      needs to be corrected, he added. Johnson, who met with Deputy      Foreign Permanent Secretary Veerasak Futrakul, declined to      make any statement.       Ministry spokesman Sihasak Phuangketkeow, however, quoted      Johnson as saying: ``The US generally views Thailand's human      rights record in a positive light, whether it is about      economic or political freedom.'' Sihasak submitted a memo to      Johnson claiming that only 46 cases of extra-judicial      killings were recorded and the 1,386 drug-related deaths      cited in the US report were not extra-judicial executions. He      also dismissed the allegation that the government would not      allow the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights      to make a visit to look into the matter. ``A request has      never been made,'' he said. According to National Police      figures released in December, only nine cases out of 1,176      drug-related deaths have been prosecuted.       The drug killings sparked an outcry from local and      international human rights organizations. Foreign governments      and the UN Human Rights Commissioner expressed grave concern      about the murders, while His Majesty the King called on the      government to give a detailed accounting for all the deaths.      The Thai government had ``failed to investigate and prosecute      vigorously those who committed such abuses, contributing to a      climate of impunity,'' the US report said.       After Thaksin's visit to Washington last June, bilateral      relations strengthened as Thailand agreed to dispatch troops      to Iraq and offered Americans immunity from the International      Criminal Court. Thailand signed the ICC treaty but has not      yet ratified it. Last December, US President George W. Bush      officially designate Thailand a major non-Nato ally, a move      that boosted security cooperation between the two countries.                          ____________________
