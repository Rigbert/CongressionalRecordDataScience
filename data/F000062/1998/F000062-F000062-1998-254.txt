 President, I rise today in strong support of the amendment offered by Senator Lautenberg and Senator Dewine to implement a nationwide .08 blood alcohol level requirement for DUI offenses.  Let me begin by saying that I agree with those who say alcohol consumption--and how much is enough--should be a matter of personal responsibility. Adults should have the common sense to know when enough is enough and when not to get behind the wheel.  Tragically, however, the statistics show common sense is not that common.  In California, we already have the .08 standard and still the accident rates are staggering. According the California Highway Patrol, there were 91,654 DUI arrests and 37,622 DUI accidents in 1996. Also in that year, there were 1,254 fatalities and 35,654 injuries due to DUI-related accidents. Let me remind you this is with the standard we are pushing for in this bill.  To put these statistics in perspective, in California there were 3,555 total traffic fatalities in 1996. Nearly 40 percent of the traffic fatalities in California in 1996 were alcohol related. I understand this is consistent with the national average which show that 41 percent of all traffic fatalities are alcohol related.  According to a MADD survey, 68.8 Americans support lowering the legal blood alcohol limit to .08. That same survey showed that 53 percent of Americans consider drunk drivers to be the nation's number one highway safety problem.  However, when you cut through the numbers, this is really an issue about saving lives and about personal safety. Every American--no matter where they live--has a right to feel safe on our highways. I believe tough DUI laws, including strict blood alcohol limits, do reduce drunk driving and do make our roads safer.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
