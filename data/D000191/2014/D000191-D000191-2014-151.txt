Speaker, Jim Oberstar was a true gentleman of the House who ably represented Minnesota's 8th District for 36 years. He was a fixture of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Jim started as staff in the 1960s, became a Member in the 1970s, then served as Chairman of the Committee from 2007 to 2011. I was blessed to work, and sometimes ride, alongside Jim for many years. Given his many years of work to improve transportation in Minnesota and across the country, it is fitting that a portion of Interstate Highway 35 be renamed in his honor.   As a tireless advocate on transportation issues, Jim earned well-deserved admiration in many circles, including in my home state of Oregon. He accompanied me on tours to advocate for increased infrastructure investment. Jim truly understood the importance of investment as a way to create American jobs, improve safety, and build roads, bridges and transit systems to accommodate a 21st Century economy. His passion and leadership are evident in projects across the country.   Jim was also an avid cyclist, and I am grateful I had the opportunity to show him my state in 2007 during the Cycle Oregon event. He was one tough athlete, easily outpacing cyclists half his age. Jim was a champion of the road in more ways than one.   Like many people in Washington, DC, Minnesota and beyond, I feel fortunate to consider Jim not only a colleague, but a friend and a mentor. I only wish he had lived long enough to share all of his knowledge with the rest of us.                          ____________________
