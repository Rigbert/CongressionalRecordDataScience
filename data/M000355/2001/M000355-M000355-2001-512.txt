 President, one of the advantages of having been around here a while is I remember when this idea first surfaced by the distinguished Senator from New Mexico in the late 1980s. He correctly identified this at that time as one of the significant problems developing. Now, some 13 or 14 years later, we are finally getting an opportunity to address one of the significant issues, one of the significant problems in our current campaign system.  One, obviously, is the hard money contribution money limit being set at $1,000, back when a Mustang cost $2,700 which only exacerbated the problem Senator Domenici is talking about because it is harder for a nonwealthy candidate to compete, given the eroding contribution limit.  The other, obviously, is the cost of reaching the voters, the television time. That, I am sure, will be discussed in the course of this 2-week debate.  I thank Senator Domenici for his important work on this over a lengthy period of time and congratulate Senator DeWine for his contribution and the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, for her contribution as well.  This is an important amendment. It will advance this debate in the proper direction, and given the support of Senator Durbin and others on the other side of the aisle, we look forward to its passage later in the day.
