Whip, we are approximately 15 days from the end of the fiscal year. The only appropriation bill signed by the President is the defense bill, leaving 12 appropriation bills still pending. Presumably we are either going to do something that would be extraordinary, passing those bills within the time frame left to us, which I guess is 6 or 7 legislative days at most, or passing some type of CR or omnibus. Can the gentleman advise the House as to what the leadership's current thinking is on how we are going to proceed as we approach the end of the fiscal year on September 30?
