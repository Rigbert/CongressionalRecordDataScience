 President, I think I have to give a bottom line and say it is working. Or if that is not good enough for you--after 2 years--that it is something that is working, it is something that is needed, it is something that Republicans got passed. And we did not get it passed without Democratic help, thank God--it was bipartisan--otherwise we would not have gotten it done. But for 4 years we were waiting for something to happen on your side of the aisle. It did not happen.  So could I end by saying one thing? In case my word is not so good, I would quote from the LA Times. It is in response to what the Senator said about the VA program. And I do not have any problems with the VA program. But it says here:       VA officials can negotiate major price discounts because      they restrict the number of drugs on their coverage list. In      other words, the VA offers lower drug prices but fewer      choices.  Now, do we want to give the seniors of America fewer choices? I think you do. The route you are going, that is where you are going to end up.
