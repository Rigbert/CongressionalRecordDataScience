Mr. Speaker, I'm sure many people followed the case against Lamar Owens, as well as the not guilty verdict that followed. Because the impact of this case does not end with the verdict, I am submitting two opinion articles for the Record. I believe these articles highlight some important things to consider regarding the lasting impact these charges will have on this young man, his accuser, and so many others. I submit the following opinion articles for the Record: ``Owens absolved, but Navy case has no winners,'' by Rick Maese from the Baltimore Sun and ``Academy can help dispel cloud from rape case,'' which appeared in the Capital on August 1, 2006.                    [From the Capital, Aug. 1, 2006]              Academy Can Help Dispel Cloud From Rape Case       Whatever conduct Midshipman 1st Class Lamar Owens admitted      to when he was court-martialed on rape charges, much of the      second guessing following his acquittal on those charges      hasn't focused on him. It has focused on the Naval Academy,      which relied on noncredible testimony in a case that      showcased the superintendent's crackdown on sexual      harassment.       A military jury recently acquitted Midshipman Owens of      raping a female midshipman. It found insufficient evidence to      disregard Midshipman Owens' version of events. He contended      all along that the sexual intercourse was consensual.       The female midshipman, who had a history of alcohol abuse,      had returned to her dorm drunk on the night of the incident.      Midshipman Owens testified that she invited him to her room      and that she fell asleep during sexual intercourse.       It was her word against his--and the verdict surprised no      one who followed the trial. The jury did convict Midshipman      Owens of the lesser charge of conduct unbecoming of an      officer, but declined to impose any punishment for it.       The case was deeply flawed. Not only did the accuser's      history cast doubt on her testimony, but she didn't even cry      for help from a roommate asleep just a few feet away. All the      prosecutors really had solid evidence for was a sexual      encounter--something that violated the institution's honor      code, but is not unheard-of at the academy.       There are no winners here, but right now the biggest loser      seems to be Midshipman Owens. His reputation can't be      restored and the suffering for himself and his family can't      be erased. The superintendent should drop any further action      against him.       It is less clear what to do with his accuser. She and her      friends were granted immunity for their testimony, so she      faces only minor disciplinary action. Perjury trumps      immunity--so if prosecutors believe she perjured herself,      would they pursue those charges with equal determination?       Just what is the penalty for making a false accusation?      Graduation and a commission? The accuser's name wasn't      paraded before the public. Her family didn't have to face      public speculation and ridicule. She was shielded. But given      the problems she admitted to at the trial, is she the kind of      officer we'd want to lead troops into combat?       The superintendent, Vice Adm. Rodney Rempt, inherited a      school with a history of sexual misconduct. We applaud his      determination to purge the academy of sexual harassment. But      in the process of demonstrating their resolve, he and his      staff appear to have chosen the wrong case.       We don't know if the superintendent got bad advice from the      attorneys or if he decided to make an example of Midshipman      Owens, the former quarterback of the Navy football team. But      now that Midshipman Owens has been acquitted of rape, we      believe he has suffered enough. If his accuser ends up with      the commission that he deserves, then the worst miscarriage      of justice is yet to come.                                  ____                [From the Baltimore Sun, July 23, 2006]              Owens Absolved, but Navy Case Has No Winners                            (By Rick Maese)       Forget the campus fame, the media coverage, the proud alums      and the smiling boosters. There's no real meaning behind any      of that.       The game clock only hints at this possibility, but there's      a point for everybody when you realize that the game is over.      When you step off the playing field, your role changes.       One minute: a star quarterback, the team's most valuable      player, playing in a bowl game. The next: a worried      defendant, the accused, marooned far away from the football      field.       One minute: a successful coach, the father figure, a leader      of men. The next: a character witness, the supporter, taking      a stand in a courtroom.       There's no scoreboard that will tell you this, but there      wasn't a single winner when Lamar Owens, the Naval Academy's      quarterback last season, was cleared of rape charges last      week.       On Friday, a military jury recommended no punishment for      Owens in connection with two lesser charges.       Navy coach Paul Johnson was at home when he heard the news.      He picked up the phone and called Owens. It went to voice      mail, and the coach said that he was happy for Owens, happy      for his family, and that he hoped they could all move      forward.       As tough as the past six months have been, moving forward      is no easy challenge. Not for Owens and not for his accuser.      Not for the academy and not for Johnson's football team.       ``Lamar and his family, for them this has been a tremendous      pressure,'' Johnson said. ``I wasn't really worried about the      program. The program stands on its own. I can see where for      some people, though, the verdict does vindicate Lamar and      maybe it does vindicate the program a little bit.''       Johnson has remained mostly tightlipped about the case. He      spoke with reporters during the team's spring practice but      has said little else. Even after the verdict, Johnson was      careful with his words when I spoke with him Friday evening.       But you could tell how highly Johnson regards Owens. The      two met six years ago when the coach recruited Owens to play      for him at Division I-AA powerhouse Georgia Southern. Then,      when Johnson accepted the Navy job five years ago, he      persuaded Owens to follow him to Annapolis.       There's a reason that Owens' defense attorneys called on      Johnson as a character witness. The coach took the stand and      said Owens had always been ``above reproach,'' but the judge,      Navy Cmdr. John Maksym, barred Johnson from sharing any      opinions on the charges brought against Owens.       ``What they were saying Lamar did, well, it was just      totally out of character,'' Johnson told me on Friday. ``The      accusations weren't the Lamar I knew.''       That's why it was so easy for Johnson to tell everyone to      just allow the case to play out. Johnson says he was      confident that if Owens was not guilty, the evidence and      testimony would reveal it.       ``I think some people are quick to jump to conclusions,''      he said. ``But my take all along was: Let's wait and see what      happens. People want to rush to judgment, but that's not fair      to anybody. You have to give a guy a chance to defend      himself.''       The charges never made sense to anyone who knew Owens. He      was from a good home--his father works for the power company,      his mother is a prenatal nurse. He attended a military school      before coming to the Naval Academy. He recited Scripture to      friends and attended Bible study sessions every Thursday.       In fact, after the accuser went to academy officials with      her allegations, several of Owens' teammates wanted to      confront her en masse. Owens pleaded with them not to. He      even went to Johnson and asked the coach to also discourage      his teammates.       They all love Owens. It's why the players voted him Most      Valuable Player of last season's 8-4 team. It's why they were      in court for 10 straight days, sitting together in the      gallery as a show of support.       They all breathed a sigh of relief Friday. What they knew      about their friend, now everyone knew.       But no one thinks this is completely over. When someone      levies a serious charge, such as rape, the pounding of a      gavel doesn't make everything disappear.       Owens has completed his classwork but isn't certain he'll      be allowed to graduate. There's also the possibility that he      could be expelled from the academy and forced to repay costs      for his taxpayer-funded schooling: $140,000.       ``He's been remarkably upbeat,'' Johnson said of Owens. ``I      think he's handling stuff very well.''       Owens won, but so much has been lost. In sports, victory is      supposed to be the ultimate reward, but that doesn't always      translate neatly to the real world.       There's so often a gray area--between consent and force,      between innocence and guilt, between winning and losing.       ``Nobody wins in these situations,'' Johnson said.       Owens is a free man now. The Midshipmen begin practice next      week. And life at the academy is back to normal.       But not really.       There are lessons in this for everyone--surely, for Owens      and his accuser, but also for team officials and school      administrators. It's just unfortunate that this is how      lessons are learned.       Ownes led his team in rushing and passing and touchdowns      last season. He took the Midshipmen to the Poinsettia Bowl, a      51-30 win over Colorado State. It was a great senior season,      one most Navy fans won't soon forget.       Time will pass and Owens' place in school lore will be      cemented. When that happens, it'd be nice if Owens is      remembered for all that he did at the academy and not for      something he didn't.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Pages E1665-E1666]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]             ACQUITTAL OF MIDSHIPMAN 1ST CLASS LAMAR OWENS                                 ______                                                             HON.
