 President, there is a quotation engraved on the wall at Union Station. It goes like this:       Be noble, and the nobleness that lies in other men sleeping      but never dead will rise in majesty to meet thine own.  Bill Roth also brought out the humility in those who worked with him and those who were around him.  There is much more to say about him. I have said too much.  I apologize. I did not realize that time was controlled. My colleague from Delaware, a cosponsor of this resolution, Senator Carper, would like to speak. I ask whether my colleagues would object if Senator Carper is able to proceed.
