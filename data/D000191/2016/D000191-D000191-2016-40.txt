Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman and the other advocates for this provision, in addition to, of course, the Senate. The gentlewoman has worked tirelessly on this issue, approached me many, many times about the fact that we have sort of neglected the potential of the Seaway.  I think that this provision would be extraordinarily meritorious, and I certainly intend to support it in conference and hope to garner support from the chairman and others so that it can stay in the bill as it finally goes to the President's desk.  I reserve the balance of my time.
