 President, I rise today to introduce legislation which I hope might move the Senate closer to the passage of meaningful campaign finance reform. I have voted for versions of the McCain-Feingold reform legislation at least six times in the past 4 years. I continue to support passage of that bill, and I will vote for it in the future.  I am concerned, however, that this legislation might not come up for a vote again in this Congress. Earlier this morning, the Rules Committee, of which I am a member and which Senator McConnell chairs, began a series of hearings on the constitutionality of campaign finance reform. At that time, I indicated that what I wished to do was submit a bill which might have an opportunity to break the gridlock surrounding campaign finance reform, and develop some kind of consensus.  So if I may, on behalf of Senator Torricelli and myself, I send a bill to the desk and ask for its submission to committee.
