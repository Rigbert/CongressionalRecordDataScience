Mr. Speaker, it is fitting that today Iranians who hope for freedom and democracy in their own country stood at the Capitol Building of the United States--a symbol of democracy and freedom for millions of people all over the world--to remember that 16 years ago this Saturday the dreams and hopes for democracy and freedom in Iran were destroyed with the creation of the Islamic Republic of Iran.  Since then Iran has unleashed a reign of terror from the streets of Tehran to nations all over the world. Through their support, encouragement and perpetuation of international terrorism the Islamic Republic of Iran has burdened, maimed and stolen the lives of innocent citizens of the world community. In the last 16 years, the Iranian Government has held hostage United States, British, French and other foreign nationals. The government continues to hold its own entire nation hostage with millions of people paralyzed due to fear of imprisonment, torture and death.  The Iranian Government has one of the worst human rights records in the world. They have no desire to join the international community as nations move toward democratic reform and greater freedom and protection of human rights.  In Iran today there is a complete disregard for the dignity of human life. We can see this clearly in the area of religious liberty. A Shari'a court has ruled that the members of the minority Bahai community are ``unprotected infidels,'' not worthy of legal protections. They are described as ``misguided'' and the Iranian Government persecutes them in an effort to ``purify'' Islam.  The Christian minorities were shaken last year with the tragic deaths of Bishop Haik Mehr, Mehdi Dibaj, and Tateos Michaelian. All three were giants in Iran's small but vibrant Christian community. Eight converts from Islam were beaten and tortured in an effort to make them deny their Christian faith.  United States resident Hassan Shahjamali, a Christian visiting his family in Iran, was detained by security police and held incommunicado for several days last May. Only after the international community loudly protested and called for his release did the Iranian Government finally release him and allow him to return to the United States.  The Iranian Government's support of terrorism world wide has unleashed a wave of violence and fear. Each year thousands have died because of Iranian supported terrorist activities. Murders and bombings in Germany, Turkey, Switzerland, and Argentina; the direct attack on Americans on Pan Am Flight 103, at the United States Marine Barracks in Beirut and the bombing of the World Trade Center have all been traced to Teheran.  Yet after 16 years of terror, and repression; after 16 years of brutality and systematic abuse, the spirit of the real Iranian people lives on. Thousands of Iranian believers have not given up their dream of freedom and democracy. They continue to raise their voices and they challenge us to do the same.  Just days before his death last January Bishop Haik Mehr predicted his martyrdom. As he departed a conference in Pakistan in December he told Brother Andrew, the champion of religious freedom, justice, and tolerance that ``when they kill me it will not be because of my silence.'' On January 20, 1994 Bishop Haik's body was found. He had been tortured before he was killed. He knew the risks if he acted on his convictions--and he paid the price.  Today we stand with Bishop Mehr and the thousands of others of all faiths and walks of life who have raised their voices for freedom and justice in Iran. We honor them by supporting freedom, democracy and justice. We, too, look to a day when Iran will be free. Only then will the world have an opportunity for peace and stability, free from the fear of terrorism and tyranny.                          ____________________
