Speaker, it is with great admiration that I rise today to honor the memory of Mr. Howard D. Samuel, and his lifelong contributions to our great country. Howard passed away on June 19, 2003. His efforts as a veteran of the labor movement, as well as his numerous positive accomplishments during his long career, are worthy of the highest commendation.  Howard began his work in the labor movement in 1949 as an organizer with the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America. He was then elected as international vice president in 1966. His dedication and unrelenting service to the movement paved the way for new and innovative solutions to labor problems and issues. In 1977, he was appointed U.S. Deputy Secretary of Labor for International Labor Affairs by President Carter. His role as Deputy Secretary allowed him the opportunity to be involved with many facets of the department such as international trade, trade adjustment assistance, and the International Labor Organization.  In 1979, Howard was elected President of the Industrial Union Department, a federation consisting of over 50 national and international unions affiliated with the AFL-CIO. During his presidency, he founded the Collective Bargaining Forum, a study group of union presidents and various company CEOs. This Forum initiated several groundbreaking reports on industrial relations issues. In 1991, Howard was the first labor representative to ever be appointed to the Defense Science Board, a key advisory organization to the Secretary of Defense.  Howard, by serving in the U.S. Army from 1943 to 1945, exhibited his true sense of patriotic duty to our nation. He also served as vice chairman of both the New York Coalition and the Council on Competitiveness. Along with his many other contributions to society, he was also a trustee and board member of the Carnegie Corporation, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center in Atlanta, as well the American Civil Liberties Union, to name just a few.  Mr. Speaker, Howard D. Samuel dedicated his life to supporting the labor movement and serving as a leader and role model for all Americans. I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in remembering Mr. Samuel and his lifetime of achievement and devotion to our great country. He will be remembered honorably and truly missed.                          ____________________
