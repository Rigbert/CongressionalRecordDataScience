President, I am introducing legislation today on behalf of the current President of Lithuania, His Excellency Valdas Adamkus. President Adamkus is a Lithuanian native and a former U.S. citizen with more than a quarter century of distinguished service to our nation. His election last year to the Lithuanian presidency made necessary his renunciation of his U.S. citizenship. My legislation provides an exemption for President Adamkus from several consequences associated with his renunciation. More specifically, my bill exempts President Adamkus from any expatriate taxes, restores President Adamkus' Social Security benefits, ensures his right to his federal pension, and grants President Adamkus the right to travel freely throughout the United States.  Valdas Adamkus was born on November 3, 1928 in Kaunas, Lithuania. Before immigrating to the United States in 1949, he was involved with Lithuanian resistance efforts against both Nazi Germany and Soviet Russian invaders. Settling in Chicago, President Adamkus remained active in Lithuanian Emigre organizations and helped raise public awareness of Lithuania's occupation by the Soviet Union. Following the return of independence to the Baltics, President Adamkus served as a Coordinator for the United States Aid to the Baltic States, specializing in environmental issues and academic coordination.  President Adamkus is a graduate of the Illinois Institute of Technology, where he earned a B.S. in civil engineering before spending ten years as a consulting engineer. In 1970, President Adamkus joined the newly-created United States Environmental Protection Agency where he initially served as the Deputy Regional Administrator of the fifth region--which includes Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota and Ohio. In 1981, President Adamkus was promoted to Regional Administrator for the fifth region, a position he held until his retirement in 1997.  In a distinguished EPA career which stretched 27 years, President Adamkus held a number of leadership positions, including Chairman of the Great Lakes Water Quality Board and Chairman of the United States group that worked with the Soviet Union on water pollution issues. In 1975, he was appointed Advisor to the UN World Health Organization and represented the EPA on environmental issues in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, Japan, and China.  In 1985, President Reagan personally presented President Adamkus with the Executive Presidential Rank Award--the highest honor for a civil servant. Other honors he earned include the EPA's highest award, the gold medal for exceptional service, and the EPA's first Fitzhugh Green Award in 1988 for outstanding contributions to environmental protection internationally.  To President Adamkus, the collapse of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s and subsequent liberation of the Baltics marked the successful culmination of his lifelong commitment to Lithuania's freedom. As Lithuania began the long and painful transition from a communist totalitarian system to a free-market economy, Mr. Adamkus emerged as an ideal candidate for the Lithuanian presidency, not only because of his past work for Lithuanian freedom, but also because of the experience he gained through his career as a U.S. civil servant.  Mr. Adamkus was elected President of the Republic of Lithuania on January 4 of last year and took office on February 25. Before assuming the Lithuanian presidency, Mr. Adamkus was required to renounce his U.S. citizenship. As I mentioned at the beginning of my statement, the bill I am offering today provides a limited exemption for President Adamkus from some of the negative consequences associated with renunciation. More specifically, my bill:  (1) Exempts President Adamkus from the expatriate tax. As an expatriate, President Adamkus is subject to sections 877 and 2107 of the Internal Revenue Code, provided it is determined that his renunciation had ``for one of its principal purposes the avoidance of taxes.'' My bill exempts President Adamkus from sections 877 and 2107 by stating that his renunciation shall not ``be treated as having as one of its purposes the avoidance of any Federal tax.''  (2) Restores President Adamkus' Social Security benefits and ensures his right to his federal pension. Title 42 Section 402(t) of the US code denies Social Security benefits to non-citizens residing outside the United States. While Section 433 of that title allows our President to enter agreements with foreign countries which allow non-resident non-citizens to receive pension benefits based on periods of coverage in the United States, the U.S. currently has no such agreement with Lithuania. As a result, President Adamkus is not entitled to the Social Security benefits he earned from 37 years of work in the United States. My bill restores these benefits. My bill also ensures that Mr. Adamkus retains the federal pension he earned as an employee of the EPA.  (3) Restores President Adamkus' right to travel in the United States. As a non-resident alien, Mr. Adamkus no longer has the right to travel freely in the U.S. My bill restores this privilege.  Mr. President, with this bill, I do not suggest that we trivialize the act of renouncing one's U.S. citizenship. Renunciation of U.S. citizenship is an act ofthe highest gravity that should not be undertaken without fully considering its consequences. I believe it appropriate, however, that we provide President Adamkus with special treatment in light of his long and distinguished service to our nation, his lifelong commitment to freedom and democracy in Lithuania, and his reason for renunciation. Indeed, it is in the interest of the United States that developing countries--particularly the former Soviet Republics--succeed in establishing free-market democratic societies. Hence, even in renouncing his citizenship, President Adamkus continues to serve our nation admirably. I thank my colleagues for their consideration and urge them to join me in supporting this bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1363       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled, That,      notwithstanding any other provision of law, the renunciation      of United States citizenship by Valdas Adamkus on February      25, 1998, in order to become the President of the Republic of      Lithuania shall not--       (1) be treated under any Federal law as having as one of      its purposes the avoidance of any Federal tax,       (2) result in the denial of any benefit under title II or      XVIII of the Social Security Act, or under title 5, United      States Code, or       (3) result in any restriction on the right of Valdas      Adamkus to travel or be admitted to the United States.                                 ______                                       By
