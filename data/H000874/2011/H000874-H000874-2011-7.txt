Speaker, while there is clearly a difference in this House on a number of things, one of the things that I don't think we differ on is a lack of confidence that the Senate will do its job. I don't think we differ on that greatly because our experiences show us differently. So that what I'm asking the gentleman is that we do not put at risk the 160 million people who are expecting their tax cut to continue, the 48 million seniors who want access to their doctors, and the 2.3 million people who are going to go off unemployment, contingent upon whether the Senate acts as the gentleman wants it to. I will tell you my experience has not been great confidence that that will happen.  I will tell the gentleman further, we have tried to prepare for that contingency. We have introduced a bill with 170 cosponsors which adopts the compromise agreement so that we will give that certainty of which the gentleman speaks, allay the anxiety which we know exists, and give to those 160 million people the certainty that they will get the tax cut, the 48 million the certainty they will have access to their doctors, and the 2.3 million the certainty that they will not be kicked off the unemployment rolls so they won't be able to support themselves and their families.  I ask my friend if he will be prepared to bring that bill to the floor if in fact the Senate doesn't act.
