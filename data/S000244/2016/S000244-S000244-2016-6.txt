Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for offering this amendment.  The amendment makes reasonable and appropriate changes to the Justice Department's Family-Based Substance Abuse Treatment Program, a program authorized under the Second Chance Act. The program supports State and local government agencies and federally recognized Indian tribes in establishing or enhancing residential substance abuse treatment programs in correctional facilities that include recovery of family supportive services. This amendment ensures that the program's definition of an incarcerated parent with minor children includes pregnant women.  As a person who believes life begins at conception, I believe it is entirely appropriate for this program to provide services to pregnant women to meet their unique needs and those of their unborn children.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.
