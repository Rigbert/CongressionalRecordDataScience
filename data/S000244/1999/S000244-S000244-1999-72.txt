Chairman, I rise today to comment on H.R. 2670, the Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary Appropriations Act of 1999. This bill contains funding for the Department of Commerce's (DOC) Science and Technology programs as well as legislative guidance on some key project management issues at the Department of Commerce.  In May of this year, the Committee on Science passed H.R. 1552, the Marine Research and Related Environmental Research and Development Programs Authorization Act of 1999, and H.R. 1553, the National Weather Service and Related Agencies Authorization Act of 1999. H.R. 1553 has since passed the House on May 19th and awaits Senate action.  In H.R. 2670, NOAA is funded at $1,959,838,000 and contains transfers of $67,226,000. Within this amount, the National Weather Service (NWS) is funded at $599,196,000, which is a 7% increase over the FY 1999 enacted. Chairman Rogers noted that the NWS is the highest priority within NOAA and I concur with his comments. The protection of our citizens' life and property from severe weather must be NOAA's highest priority.  This bill funds the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research at NOAA at a level of $260,560,000. I concur with Chairman Rogers' assessment that this office should not be funding duplicative social-science and human dimensions research, and should fund hard computational science that has real benefit to the American taxpayer. The National Science Foundation (NSF) has a social science program area that is capable of making these assessments and I consider social science research at NOAA to be a low research priority.  I am pleased that the National Sea Grant College Program is funded at $58,500,000, which is $7,000,000 above the President's request. Sea Grant's cost-sharing approach with states provides greater bang for the research buck and in tight fiscal times it is the best way to stretch research dollars.  Finally, I am extremely gratified that Chairman Rogers decided not to fund the Fisheries Research Vessels that were in the NOAA request. The Commerce Inspector General and the Government Accounting Office have pointed out time and time again the need for outsourcing NOAA fleet operations. While NOAA is making some progress in the oceanographic and hydrographic outsourcing areas, there is little to no progress in the fisheries research area. I urge NOAA to examine the use of UNOLS vessels to support fisheries research. NOAA should closely examine the Dorman report which pointed out that the need for these ships is questionable.  H.R. 2670 funds the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) at $436,686,000 for FY 2000. This amount is $300,270,000 below the President's request and $210,464,000 below the FY 1999 enacted amount.  The Advanced Technology Program (ATP) at NIST is terminated in H.R. 2670. As I have stated in the past, until fundamental reforms are made to ATP that will ensure that federal grant funding is not simply displacing private capital investment, I do not think the program should be funded. The Science Committee and the full House passed just such structural changes to the program last year, but unfortunately the Senate did not act on them. The changes would not only prevent the displacement of private capital, but would increase private sector matching requirements for the program. Congresswoman Morella has once again introduced legislation, H.R. 1744, the National Institute of Standards and Technology Authorization Act of 1999, to fix the problem and authorize ATP. I am hopeful that this time the bill will be enacted.  The Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) at NIST is funded at a level of $99,836,000 in H.R. 2670. I am pleased that the bill fully funds MEP at the President's.  Finally, the construction account at NIST is funded at $56,714,000 for FY 2000. This will provide $44,916,000 of the required funds for the Advanced Measurements Laboratory. Unfortunately, funding AML at this level will not allow NIST to begin construction of the project during FY 2000. The AML is necessary due to the precise measurements required for establishing standards associated with today's increasingly complex technologies. It is my hope that additional funding may become available during the Conference to allow construction of AML to begin during Fiscal Year 2000.
