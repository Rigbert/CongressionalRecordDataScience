President, I ask to have printed in the Record a copy of a resolution passed on May 29, 1997, by the Vermont Association of Chiefs of Police supporting H.R. 1524 which creates a National Center for Rural Law Enforcement.  I would like to thank them for sharing these resolutions with me. I also look forward to working with Senators Hatch, Biden, and others in introducing legislation in the Senate in support of a National Center for Rural Law Enforcement.  The resolution follows:       Whereas, the Vermont Association of Chiefs of Police      support the National Center for: Rural Law Enforcement as      several chiefs have attended regional conferences to discuss      and identify the training and technical assistance needs of      rural law enforcement agencies nationwide; and       Whereas, more than two hundred law enforcement officials,      from rural areas, have attended these regional meetings and      validated the need for federal assistance in areas of      technical assistance, management training, and the formation      of an information clearinghouse for rural law enforcement      agencies; and       Whereas, the majority of existing local, state, and federal      programs are too costly for small rural enforcement agencies      and are generally designed to serve the larger law      enforcement agencies of the country; and       Whereas, approximately one-third of all Americans live in      rural areas, ninety percent of all law enforcement agencies      serve populations of less than 25,000 residents, seventy-five      percent of all law enforcement agencies serve a population of      fewer than 10,000 residents, while rural violent crime has      increased over thirty-five per cent in the last ten years;      and       Whereas, rural law enforcement agencies have staffing      limitations and financial limitations which make it difficult      to properly train on and/or address the specific crime-     related issues facing all rural law enforcement      administrators in our country; and       Whereas, we believe that the creation of a national center      for rural law enforcement would enhance and complement      present state standards and training and does not duplicate      any existing program; now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Vermont Association of Chiefs of Police      strongly support the creation of the National Center for      Rural Law Enforcement that would be funded through federal      legislation;       Be it further resolved, That the operational control and      oversight of the National Center for Rural Law Enforcement      would rest upon an advisory board made up primarily of      Sheriffs and Chiefs of Police from rural law enforcement      agencies from each region of the county.                          ____________________
