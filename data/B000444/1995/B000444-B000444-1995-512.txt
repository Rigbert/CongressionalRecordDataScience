 It will take me one moment. It says:       Section (a) reads, ``Section 842 of title 18, United States      Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new      section:       Subsection 1.       It shall be unlawful for any person to teach or demonstrate      the making of explosive materials, or to distribute by any      means information pertaining to, in whole or in part, the      manufacture of explosive materials, if the person intends or      knows that such explosive material or information will be      used for, or in furtherance of, an activity that constitutes      a Federal criminal offense or a criminal purpose affecting      interstate commerce.       Subsection B.       Section 844 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by      designating section (a) as subsection (a)(1), and by adding      the following new subsection:       (a)(1), any person who violates subsection (1) of section      842 of this chapter shall be fined under this title or      imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.  That is the end of the amendment. Is that correct?
