 I had asked Senator Warner, who offered to respond to it, but on that particular day I was speaking, he could not respond because he did not have the answer right then, he wanted to study it. And that is legitimate.  I asked him if he would call me to the floor the next day and to give mean opportunity to respond. He probably did not have time, so I am not stating there is fault. I am simply stating what I believe to be a fact. So we did not have a discussion of this.
