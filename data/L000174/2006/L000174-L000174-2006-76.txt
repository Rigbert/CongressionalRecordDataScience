While hasty implementation could result in avoidable problems for all those who will be affected by this Initiative, we also want to make sure that it is done on a reasonable timetable. Our amendment requires a modest implementation delay to June 1, 2009, and also requires that certain technological goals are met in the design of the PASS Card to ensure that the strictest standards are in place to protect personal information. Though it has been two years since the Intelligence Act requirement became law, the agencies have made little progress to implement WHTI. This provision (Sec. 546) provides additional guidance to the agencies to insure smooth implementation.  Our language also requires the Departments of Homeland Security and State to certify prior to implementation that a cost for the PASS Card has been agreed upon, that all border authorities are familiar with the technology, and that the technology has been shared with the Canadian and Mexican authorities. These are just a few of the steps we have taken in this amendment to ensure that the transition to an increased security environment is done without creating unnecessary obstacles.  And the Senate and House Appropriations Committees will most certainly share the Homeland Security Department and the State Department report to us on how they are progressing in meeting the program criteria and moving toward implementation.  I thank my colleagues for all their hard work on reaching an agreement on this language. With it, we greatly increase our chances for the successful implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative.
