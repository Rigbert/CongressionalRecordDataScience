 President, I oppose the Coats-Snowe amendment to the continuing resolution, S. 1594.  This amendment does two things: It puts into law a prohibition on Federal and State governments from discriminating against institutions that refuse to provide training for abortion procedures; and, it undermines the long-respected accreditation system by allowing programs to opt out of meeting the required medical training standards set by the ACGME and still receive Federal funds as if these programs met those standards.  The Coats-Snowe amendment is unnecessary, it undermines the integrity of Federal and State medical educational and licensing standards, and it represents another step in the erosion of freedom of choice in this country.                              UNNECESSARY  First of all, this amendment is unnecessary because its antidiscrimination section is redundant. Although earlier standards set by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, the accrediting body for medical residency programs, did require abortion training in ob-gyn residency programs, ACGME revised those requirements in February 1995 to explicitly exempt ob-gyn residents or institutions with religious or moral objections to performing abortions.  The policy states: ``No program or resident with a religious or moral objection will be required to provide training in, or to perform, induced abortions.''  The revised standard does not require programs to make alternative arrangements for abortion training. The only obligations on programs that do not provide the training are to inform applicants to the residency program that they do not provide abortion training and to not impede their residents from obtaining the training elsewhere for those who wish to do so.  These requirements strike a balance between the program's desire not to be involved in abortion training and fairness to residents who desire to obtain such training.  So I fail to see any need for this amendment other than to inject Congress further into the abortion decision and into questions of medical curriculum.                    UNDERMINES ACCREDITATION SYSTEM  This amendment, even with the compromise language, still undermines the system for evaluating the quality of medical training programs in this country. Under current law, medical training programs may only receive Federal funds if they are an accredited institution.  This amendment creates a loophole by allowing entities to not meet educational and training standards for ob-gyns set by ACGME, the independent accrediting body of medical experts.  Does anyone in this body think Congress is better equipped to determine the educational requirements for a medical specialty such as obstetrics and gynecology than the medical professionals who actually practice medicine?  The ACGME, a private-sector, professional entity, is the only graduate medical education accreditation organization in the United States, responsible for evaluating over 7,000 medical residency programs throughout the United States.  ACGME is sponsored by five of the leading medical organizations in the Nation: the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, the American Board of Medical Specialties, the Association of American Medical Colleges, and the Council of Medical Specialty Societies.  Accreditation by medical experts provides the only method the Federal Government has to assure that residency programs meet appropriate medical training standards. Congress should not undermine that system by supplanting political judgment in place of medical expertise.            FEDERAL INTRUSION INTO STATE LICENSING STANDARDS  Accreditation is relied upon not just by the Federal Government, but also by State governments, private funding sources, students and patients to ensure quality in medical training.  Even if the Federal Government is willing to abandon educational standards in medical training, which it should not be, it should certainly not prevent the States from maintaining standards.  All 50 States currently require an individual to participate in an ACGME accredited residency program to obtain a right to practice medicine. The Coats-Snowe amendment would prevents States from requiring that ob-gyn residency programs meet ACGME standards in abortion training for those they are licensing to practice medicine in their States. The alternative for States that wish to maintain ACGME training standards is the loss of Federal funds.  This is an unconscionable intrusion by the Federal Government into State licensing procedures.  The ACGME standards, which were unanimously approved by the sponsoring medical organizations, reflect the input of physicians, medical specialists, hospital administrators, clinicians, researchers, and educators who bring decades of medical judgment to their decisions.  The Federal Government has long recognized the specialized expertise that formulates the ACGME accreditation standards and we should not reject that expertise now simply because the issue is abortion.                           EROSION OF CHOICE  This amendment is yet another effort to chip away at a woman's right tochoose--a constitutionally protected right that the Supreme Court has clearly affirmed. This is one more in a series of steps Congress has taken to destroy that right:  The 104th Congress, in particular, has enacted an unprecedented number of laws threatening access to safe and legal abortion for many women:  Ending access to abortion for U.S. servicewomen overseas by barring abortions on military bases even if the woman used her own money. This is particularly harsh on servicewomen overseas where private facilities may be inadequate or abortion is illegal.  Prohibiting Federal employees from choosing health insurance plans with abortion coverage.  Maintaining the prohibition on Medicaid coverage for abortion for low-income women--except in cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment.  Denying access to abortion for women in Federal prisons.  Prohibiting the District of Columbia from using its own locally raised money to pay for Medicaid funded abortions.  Banning Federal funds for human embryo research.  Most significantly, Congress for the first time directly challenged Roe versus Wade by passing legislation that criminalizes a particular and rarely used abortion procedure and jails doctors who perform them.  All of these represent a steady march by the Federal Government into the abortion decision, and the weakening of a woman's constitutional right of personal privacy. The Coats amendment is yet another erosion of that right.  But it is an extremely important one. This is a direct attack on maintaining access to quality reproductive health care for women.                          SHORTAGE OF DOCTORS  There is already a severe and escalating shortage in the number of physicians who are trained and willing to provide abortion services.  The total number of abortion providers in the country decreased by nearly 20 percent since 1982--from 2,908 to 2,380--in spite of a 10-percent increase in the population.  Eighty-four percent of the counties in the United States have no physicians who can perform abortions. States such as North and South Dakota have only one provider each.  Only 25 percent of obstetrician-gynecologists in the southern United States are trained to perform abortions. Only 16 percent of doctors in the Midwest are trained.  With the violence and harassment aimed at abortion providers increasing steadily in recent years, fewer doctors are willing to risk their lives or the safety of their families, to provide abortion services.  This amendment is a thinly veiled attack on freedom of choice. By making abortion unavailable, opponents of abortion will do what they cannot do legislatively--eliminate abortion as a safe and legal option for women in this country--one State, one doctor, one piece of legislation at a time. I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.
