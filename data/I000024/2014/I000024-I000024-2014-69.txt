President, I wish to pay tribute to a true American hero, Army SPC Francisco Briseno-Alvarez who died on September 25, 2011 serving our Nation in Laghman Province, Afghanistan. Specialist Briseno-Alvarez was assigned to Headquarters Company, 1st Battalion, 279th Infantry Regiment, 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, Oklahoma Army National Guard.  SPC Briseno-Alvarez died of injuries sustained when the vehicle in which he was riding was attacked with an improvised explosive device in Laghman Province while conducting combat operations. He was 27 years old.  Our thoughts and prayers go out to those in his family he left behind: his father Javier Briseno, mother Lurdes Alvarez, and siblings Adrian and Diana Briseno.  Francisco graduated from U.S. Grant High School in Oklahoma City in 2003. He enlisted in the Oklahoma National Guard on September 11, 2010 and served as a motor transport operator in the 700th Brigade Support Battalion and then with the 1-279th Infantry Regiment.  As evident from reading through quotes from friends and family, Francisco touched people's lives in remarkable ways:  Brenda Fetzko, a neighbor said, ``I know he loved his mother very much so'' and was a good man and had a strong connection to his family. ``He was a very good person and was just getting his life going.''  Ruben Gonzalez, a friend said, ``Paco was a very nice man, and I am proud to say that he was my friend from high school and after. . . . I'm very proud of you Francisco.''  Juan Cerano, a cousin said, ``He died doing the right thing. He died serving and protecting his country. He was like the brother I never had. There's always going to be a part of him in our hearts.''  MG Myles Deering, the Oklahoma Adjutant General said, ``My thoughts and prayers are with the Briseno-Alvarez family and those of our wounded heroes. SPC Briseno-Alvarez answered the call to serve this great Nation and help defend it. His loyalty and ultimate sacrifice for the sake of our Country will never be forgotten.''  A true warrior, Francisco died while participating in tough and demanding combat operations. This fight took Francisco from us prematurely, but make no mistake; it is a fight we will win. We must continue our unwavering support for the men and women protecting our Nation and allies.  I extend our deepest gratitude and condolences to Francisco's family and friends. Francisco lived a life of love for his family and country. He will be remembered for his commitment to and belief in the greatness of our Nation. I am honored to pay tribute to this true American hero who volunteered to go into the fight and made the ultimate sacrifice for our protection and freedom.                 Army Specialist Christopher D. Gailey  Mr. President, it is my honor to also remember Army SPC Christopher D. Gailey. Chris and PFC Sarina N. Butcher, 19, of Checotah, OK, lost their lives November 1, 2011, in Laja Ahmad Khel, Paktia province of Afghanistan, when an improvised explosive device detonated near their military vehicle during a supply mission.  Born September 15, 1985, in Bartlesville, OK, Chris attended Wentworth Military Academy in Lexington, MO, before returning and graduating with the class of 2005 from Caney Valley High School in Ramona, OK.  Those who knew Chris said he was a man who ``loved his country, loved America and loved his family.''  Eager to join the National Guard, he enlisted in June 2004 before graduating high school and was assigned to the 700th Brigade Support Battalion, 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, Oklahoma National Guard, Tulsa, OK. Previously deployed to Iraq in 2007 to 2008 as a motor vehicle operator, he departed for Afghanistan in June 2011.  The Oklahoma National Guard family is deeply saddened by the loss of these two outstanding citizen-soldiers,'' MG Myles L. Deering, the Adjutant General for Oklahoma, said in a news release. ``Their commitment and willingness to serve our nation during a time of war is indicative of their tremendous character and courage. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families, friends and those that continue to serve our country in Afghanistan.''  Survivors include his parents Shan and Tammy Gailey of Ochelata, OK, his daughter Allison Marie Gailey of Bartlesville, one brother Beau Dugan of Merriam, KS, two sisters Angelina Janelle Niko of Bartlesville and Kristina Jeanette Gailey of Stillwater, OK, his paternal grandmother Lela Belle Gailey of Marshfield, MO, his maternal grandparents Carl Eugene Maples and his wife Carol of Joplin, MO, one uncle Jesse Robert Gailey, four aunts: Barbara Jane Foster, Shawn Dee Adams, Manya Alice Maples, and Sonya Jolene Hamblin,and several nieces, nephews and cousins.  ``Keep good memories of him,'' his father Shan Gailey said. ``Keep him in your heart.''

Full military rites were conducted by the Oklahoma National Guard and interment was in the Ochelata Cemetery in Ocheleta, OK.  Today we remember Army SPC Christopher D.

He enlisted in the Army in September 2004 and was assigned to the 1st Squadron, 10th Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, Fort Carson, CO.  The military was a natural choice for him, and he took college courses to advance his military career, his mother said. ``He had his clothes ironed by 5 a.m. That boy loved it,'' she said. ``He just always had a love for the military, the discipline and the way they hold their head high.''  His second tour of duty to Afghanistan began on September 6, 2011. While deployed he was able to come home in December 2011 to witness the birth of his youngest child Waylon.  ``He was the greatest father my boys could ask for. He was a great husband who loved us all very much. It makes me sad to know we won't grow old together, but he lived a beautiful life and (he) gave me three of the most beautiful things I could ask for,'' his wife Lindsey said.  His mother said she looked forward to getting calls from her son while he was in Afghanistan. ``I learned very quick when a phone call came in at 3 a.m. to jump up and answer it,'' Mitchell said. ``He would call and play his guitar and sing me a song he had written.''  On March 6, 2012, Robby was laid to rest in Hillside Cemetery in Purcell, OK. Oklahoma Governor, Mary Fallin ordered flags on State property to fly at half-staff on March 6, 2012 in honor of Robby.
