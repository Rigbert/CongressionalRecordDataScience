Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5438. And I am proud to join my friend, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Holding), in sponsoring this bill. Our bill is very simple. It helps taxpayers receive the support and guidance they need.  Low income taxpayer clinics offer a free, low-cost service for taxpayers across our country. These clinics help taxpayers resolve disputes with the IRS.  H.R. 5438 would allow the IRS to share information about low income taxpayer clinics for those who might be eligible.  Last December, the Oversight Subcommittee held a hearing on the taxpayers experience. It was one of many bipartisan meetings to improve tax administration. During the hearing, we heard testimony from Ms. Tameka R. Lester. Ms. Lester serves as the social director of the Philip C. Cook Low-Income Taxpayer Clinic at the Georgia State University College of Law.  This outstanding institution is located in my congressional district. Ms. Lester and other witnesses shared their experiences and offered many great suggestions.  H.R. 5438 responds to one of the many issues raised in our discussion. Going forward, I hope that our committee and the full House of Representatives will continue to develop bipartisan responses to their concerns and suggestions.  Again, Mr. Speaker, I hope all of our colleagues will support our bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
