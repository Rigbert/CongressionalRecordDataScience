Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for recognizing the need for funding the Secret Service, their security, planning and operations role at the 2002 Winter Olympics. I add my voice to the gentlemen from Oklahoma, Maryland andUtah in supporting this funding, and also recommend that it be included in the Fiscal Year 2002 appropriations bills.
