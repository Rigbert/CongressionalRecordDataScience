President, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial in today's New York Times in opposition be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, July 6, 2004]                        Class-Action Unfairness       A mischievous bill masquerading as an effort to reform the      system of class-action lawsuits is headed for the Senate      floor this week. The bill would tilt the civil justice system      in favor of corporations and against consumers, the      environment and public health. Democrats blocked a nearly      identical measure by just one vote last October, Since then,      three Democratic senators--Mary Landrieu of Louisiana,      Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and Charles Schumer of New      York--have agreed to switch sides to support the bill in      exchange for certain improvements in it.       Unfortunately, those improvements would not cure the bill's      core defect: namely, that it would move almost all major      class-action lawsuits to overburdened federal courts from      state courts. Such a shift is likely to delay or deny justice      in numerous instances, and, ultimately, to dilute the impact      of the strong consumer protection laws in many states.       A letter to Congress representing the views of 13 state      attorneys general, including Eliot Spitzer of New York, makes      this point emphatically. It goes on to note that the bill's      sweeping provisions moving state class actions to federal      courts would not only threaten individual plaintiffs but      would also trespass on traditional principles of federalism.       Should the Senate measure be passed, it would have to be      reconciled with an even more damaging House bill, which would      apply retroactively to pending class-action cases. The best      result would be for the Senate to defeat the bill and go back      to the drawing board. At the very least, however, it should      limit the damage by approving corrective amendments being      offered by Senator Jeff Bingaman and others to lessen the      disadvantage to plaintiffs.       No one disputes that certain provisions of the bill address      real class-action abuses, foremost among them the collusive      settlements that benefit plaintiffs' lawyers while      shortchanging their clients. But taken as a whole, the bill      before the Senate isn't genuine tort reform. It is mostly a      gift to wealthy special interests that is mislabeled as      reform.
