 President, In the managers' amendment there is a whole new program for a subsidy for the maritime industry. At 5 minutes to 9 on a Friday night, when we are not normally in session, before we are going to take a week's vacation, it does not seem to me that we should be passing a whole new program without some mention to the taxpayers of this country.  Since January or February the whole approach to this new program has been a very careful one-man show behind the scenes to, in a stealthy way, get this program out of the authorization committee with as little attention as possible, promising as much as you could to keep people quiet.  So, I rise to first of all tell the people of this country about this new program that has operating subsidies and a shipbuilding loan guarantee for the maritime industry. I oppose it because virtually every truly independent analysis of the maritime subsidies and protectionist programs have concluded that they have little or nothing to do with our defense needs. Remember, these programs of subsidies were started in the 1930's, the 1940's, the 1950's, to provide ships for our defense needs. When these programs started we had 1,100, 1,200 ships. Today we have between 250 and 300 ships. So you know the old saying, you subsidize something you get more of it? In this particular case it does not work.  This ends up being a waste of the hard-earned money of America's taxpayers and consumers. In all my years in Congress I fought hard to uncover and eliminate waste, fraud and abuse within the Federal Government. I fought waste in a wide range of programs. This week we won a victory for the taxpayers by eliminating AmeriCorps. And I fought hard against $1,800 toilet seats and $400 hammers, money squandered by the Pentagon in the name of national defense.  Maritime subsidies are, as well, supposedly for the national defense. Yet, during the last war we were involved in, the Persian Gulf war, 86 percent of the materiel that went by ship was not shipped on commercial American flagged ships. We do not have the capacity for doing that because we have had a program that was supposed to work for the national defense and it has not worked.  So, maritime subsidies, in the false name of national defense, I think, after 4 decades, we ought to conclude, squander taxpayers' money as well.  Historically, anyone who has scrutinized maritime programs has come under fierce public attack by the maritime industry's Washington lobby. My motives have been criticized because I come from an agricultural State.  Let me admit, initially my interest in the maritime programs was limited to its impact on agriculture, because our maritime, through its back-door, hidden cargo preference subsidy, not only undercuts our ability to develop and expand overseas agriculture markets but also, and more tragically, cargo preference literally takes food out of the mouths of hungry people and starving people around the world. Simply, the money that otherwise could have gone to send more food to the starving is eaten up by the outrageous rates charged by U.S. flag maritime companies, sometimes three to four times the world rate.  But it soon became apparent to me that most of the burden of our maritime subsidies and programs is shouldered by the Defense Department in terms of cargo preference and by the American consumers, laborers and businesses, in terms of the Jones Act.  But one of the fascinating things about my long journey in trying to expose and stop this maritime waste is the type of attack directed at me. It surprises me that the Defense Department and the defense industry has not used this attack--in short, why has not the defense community argued that they are entitled to spend $1,800 on toilet seats? After all, farmers get subsidies. Probably, the fact that this is such a ridiculous argument is the reason that the Defense Department has not used it. But that certainly has not stopped the maritime industry.   Of course there is a big difference. Farm programs are scrutinized publicly and intensely every few years, if not every year during the budget process.  When is the last time we have had full-scale hearings, bringing in supporters and opponents to the maritime programs?  The Commerce Committee held one hearing in July of this year to discuss the so-called Merchant Marine Security Act. Only supporters were invited. Not only were maritime program critics not invited, but their requests to testify were denied as well. Talk about a one-sided story promoted by a committee of the Congress. Then, before the Commerce Committee, written questions were even answered by those testifying, the bill was rushed through by a voice vote.  Yesterday, there was considerable discussion about recommitting to a committee a nomination because new information was provided subsequent to committee action. Well, today, I am submitting for the Record information directly related to the Merchant Marine Security Act and directly related to the pending amendment that is in the managers' amendment from the other side. I am convinced that my colleagues on the Commerce Committee did not have this information. If they had it, there is no way they could support S. 1139, the Merchant Marine Security Act.  I want my colleagues to know that what I am about to read is not this Senator's opinion. Instead, this information is the culmination of months of work by maritime experts from 16 different Government agencies, executive branch agencies--not a congressional study, not a GAO study, not a private think-tank study, but a study by 16 Government agencies of the executive branch.  This memo I think is explosive and sets a lot straight. This memo is entitled ``Memorandum for the President''--meaning memorandum for President Clinton. It is from Robert Rubin. Robert Rubin is now the Secretary of the Treasury, as you know. The subject: Decision memorandum on maritime issues.  It is dated, the White House, Washington, June 30, 1993. Purpose of the memo: This memorandum asks you to decide--meaning asking the President to decide, from the Robert Rubin who is now Secretary of the Treasury--asks you to decide on the level and form of subsidies to be given to various U.S. maritime industries.  So this decision is asked to be played at the highest level of our Government, the President of the United States.  Now, for background, because there are paragraphs here on background.       The U.S.-Flag Fleet. The U.S.-flag fleet is engaged in both      domestic and international trade. Ships in domestic trades      are permanently protected from foreign-flag competition by      the Jones Act. This memorandum describes options to subsidize      ships that are employed in international trade and therefore      subject to competition. The international trade fleet      consists of 95 liners (ships designed principally to carry      goods in containers) and 60 bulkers (ships that carry loose      cargo such as liquids and ore).       The principal issue in this memorandum is whether expiring      direct subsidies should be replaced with new subsidies for      U.S.-flag liners. (No agency supports direct subsidies for      bulkers). If no new program is announced, most U.S. liners      are likely to reflag their vessels. The reflagged ships would      still be owned and controlled by U.S. firms; their U.S. crews      (about 10,000 seafarers) would be replaced by foreign      mariners. A related issue is whether the plethora of indirect      subsidies that now support a wide range of maritime interests      should be expanded., maintained or phased-out.       Budgetary Context. Option 1 would require DOD to shift      defense outlays; it would be deficit neutral. Options 2 and 3      would increase mandatory spending. Under the Budget      Resolution, offsets would have to be identified to make the      proposals deficit neutral. Options 2 and 3 would also result      in savings on the discretionary side of the budget from the      phase-out of existing subsidy programs. While these savings      could be used for new discretionary outlays, they could not      be used as offsets for any new mandatory spending.  Then it goes on in more detail from the Secretary of the Treasury to President Clinton.       Option 1. Require DOD to Support U.S.-Flag Ships Needed for      Defense:       Rationale. Subsidies for the U.S. flag fleet have always      been justified by their role in providing a sealift capacity      for use in military emergencies. With the end of the Cold War      DOD's sealift requirements have declined. Although DOD's      bottom-up review is not complete, the Secretary of Defense,      the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Commander      of the Transportation Command have already concluded that      future requirements will not exceed 20-30 liner vessels. DOD      will have no need for bulk vessels. All agencies therefore      oppose renewal of direct subsidies for bulkers. This option      would meet DOD's maximum military requirements.       Description. DOD would be directed to spend $60 million      annually on contracts with ship operators to provide DOD with      the services of up to 30 U.S.-flag liners in times of      military need. New contracts would be phased-in as current      subsidies expire or are terminated. If U.S.-flag ships are      subsidized through other means, such as Option 2 or Option 3,      DOD would be allowed to spend its limited resources meeting      more pressing defense requirements.       Under this option, the Administration would oppose the      expansion of indirect maritime subsidies. [Alternatively, the      Administration could, as many agencies recommend, seek the      phase-out of any indirect subsidies not required to meet a      specific military need.]       Budget Cost. This option would subsidize U.S.-flag liner      ships by reprogramming money already in the DOD budget (DOD      plans to obtain the funds by retiring 29 breakbulk ships from      the Ready Reserve Fleet). The option would be deficit      neutral.       Arguments in favor: These subsidies would provide for      genuine defense needs, and therefore would enjoy broad      support. By subsidizing 30 of the 52 liners now under      contract, this option would sustain 1,500 seafaring jobs and      about 750 landside jobs. Indirect subsidies come at the      expense of other U.S. industries and hinder the missions of      other Executive Branch agencies.  There is one argument that Secretary Rubin gave to the President to be against this.  Provides less support than is sought by the industry and its supporters.  I ask unanimous consent that the rest of the Rubin memo be included in the Record.  There being no objection, the memo was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Option 2. Increase Direct and Indirect Subsidies to      Maritime Interests:       Rationale. This option is designed to keep most of the      existing U.S.-flag liners in foreign trade sailing under the      U.S. flag, regardless of defense needs.       Description. The option has four main elements:       (1) Increase to 79 from 52 the number of liner ships      receiving direct payments. DOT would be authorized to sign      10-year contracts at $2.5 million per ship per year in the      first four years, and $2.0 million per ship per year in the      last six years. In the first two years, new contracts would      be limited by savings made available from the existing      program.       (2) Allow non-subsidized, foreign-built vessels to receive      subsidies.       (3) Provide $200 million in FY94-96 for Title XI loan      guarantees to U.S. shipyards.       (4) Do not Oppose Congressional efforts to expand indirect      maritime subsidies.       Budget cost: Over 10 years, this option would increase      mandatory outlays by $1.7 billion, while decreasing domestic      discretionary outlays by $567 million.       Arguments in favor:       This option contains subsidies for liners, bulkers, and      shipyards in order to win support for the proposal from the      widest range of maritime interests.       Subsidizing 79 ships would sustain 4,000 seafaring jobs and      about 2,000 landside jobs.       Since foreign-built vessels may be less expensive, this      option could reduce carriers' costs.       Arguments against:       Subsidizing 79 vessels is unnecessary. This would be two to      three times the maximum number of ships DOD estimates are      needed to meet its sealift requirements.       The NEC Principals found no evidence that this segment of      the maritime industry was of strategic importance to the      economy. The U.S. has no competitive advantage in the      industry; the industry neither protects nor enhances U.S.      exports. Subsidizing carriers simply to preserve jobs would      leave the Administration hard pressed to explain why it      should not also subsidize every other industry that suffers      job losses.       Immediate funding for Title XI loan guarantees is      premature. All agencies, including DOT, support the efforts      of the congressionally-mandated Working Group on the U.S.      Shipbuilding Industry. The Working Group will present options      to assist shipyards to the relevant Cabinet members later      this summer (see TAB B).       Greater indirect subsidies would come at the expense of      other U.S. industries and hinder the missions of other      Executive Branch agencies.       Option 3. Provide Direct Subsidies to a Limited Number of      U.S.-Flag Liner Ships:       Rationale. This compromise option is designed to subsidize      a U.S.-flag fleet that will meet defense needs and, if      desired, keep additional U.S.-flag vessels employed in the      international trades. The option would limit the number of      liners receiving subsidies to a range that could be more      readily justified to critics--between 30 ships (DOD's current      estimate of its maximum need) and 52 ships (the number of      liners currently under contract).       Description. Provide direct payments to between 30 and 52      liner ships. DOT would be authorized to sign 10-year      contingency contracts providing $2.5 million per ship per      year in the first four years, and $2.0 million per ship per      year in the last six years. New contracts in the first two      years would be limited to savings made available from the      existing program.       Under this option, the Administration would oppose the      expansion of any indirect maritime subsidies. [Alternatively,      the Administration could, as many agencies recommend, seek      the phase-out of any indirect subsidies not required to meet      a specific military need.]       The Administration would oppose--as premature--funding for      loan guarantees until NEC Principals consider options      developed by the Working Group on U.S. Shipbuilding.       Budget Cost. Over ten years, direct subsidies for 30 ships      would increase mandatory outlays by $500 million, while      reducing domestic discretionary outlays by $358 million.      Direct subsidies for 52 ships would increase mandatory      outlays by $975 million and reduce domestic discretionary      outlays by $358 million.       Arguments in favor:       Would provide the industry with more money and longer      contracts than Option 1.       This option would sustain 1,500-2,500 seafaring jobs and      about 750-1,250 landside jobs.       Restricts or eliminates indirect subsidies that come at the      expense of other industries or hinder the missions of other      Departments.       Arguments against:       Provides less support than sought by industry and its      supporters.                            recommendations       Fifteen Executive Branch Agencies support Option 1. The      Department of Transportation supports Option 2. A compromise      proposal is provided by Option 3. In addition to the      strengths and weaknesses of each option, these      recommendations reflect different views about the economic      and strategic importance of liner ships engaged in      international trade, as well as the extent of Congressional      support for maritime subsidies. These views are noted in TAB      C.                                decision       ________ Approve Option 1.       ________ Approve Option 1 as amended.       ________ Approve Option 2.       ________ Approve Option 2 as amended.       ________ Approve Option 3.       ________ Approve Option 3 as amended.       ________ Take No Action.       ________ Discuss Further.     Tab A: Background on Current Maritime Subsidies       The federal government now subsidizes ship operators      through a variety of programs, including:       (1) Operating Differential Subsidies. Under the ODS      program, the federal government entered 20 year contracts      with U.S.-flag operators. These contracts provided that the      federal government would pay the difference between wages on      U.S.-flag ships and wages on their principal competitor's      foreign-flag ships; in some cases, the government also      undertook to pay the differential on other costs such as      maintenance and repair. ODS contracts now cover 52 liner      ships and 28 bulk ships. ODS payments in 1993 are expected to      total $244 million, for an average per ship subsidy of about      $3.0 million.       To qualify for ODS payments, vessels must meet a number of      restrictions. ODS liners must: be U.S.-built, U.S.-flag, and      at least 51 percent owned by U.S. citizens; provide service      on ``essential trade routes''; receive approval from the      Maritime Administration before: altering trade routes;      affiliating with foreign-flag service; or operating in      domestic trades.       (2) Ocean Freight Differential (cargo preference) program.      Cargo preference laws require certain federal programs to      ship between 50 and 100 percent of their cargo on U.S.-flag      ships. OMB estimates that in 1993, cargo preference      requirements will increase government shipping costs by about      $590 million over shipping rates. These costs will be borne      by the Department of Defense, Agriculture, Transportation,      State, the Agency for International Development, and the      Export-Import Bank.       (3) Capital Construction Funds (CCFs). Owners of U.S.-flag,      U.S.-built ships may shelter income by placing it in a CCF.      Taxes on both the income placed in a CCF and the interest      earned by the CCF are deferred indefinitely. CCF balances are      now approximately $1.2 billion.       (4) Title XI. Under this program, the federal government      guarantees private loans made to the purchasers of U.S.-built      ships. Loans were last guaranteed under this program in 1992.      In 1993, $48 million was appropriated for the program, but no      loans were guaranteed. No funds were requested for this      program in the President's FY 1994 Budget. The government's      outstanding contingent liability under this program now      stands at about $2 billion.       (5) Jones Act. Like most other seafaring nations, the U.S.      provides cabotage for its ship operators--all domestic      waterborne trade must be carried on U.S.-flag, U.S.-built      ships. The Jones Act fleet accounts for about 50 percent of      the privately-owned oceangoing U.S.-flag fleet.       (6) The Shipping Act of 1984. Since 1916, the U.S. has      allowed U.S. and foreign carriers serving U.S. trades to      participate in international shipping cartels known as      conferences. The Council of Economic Advisors and the      Department of Justice estimate that the Act raises shipping      prices at least 10 to 15 percent, providing U.S. and foreign      carriers with a subsidy valued at $2-3 billion per year      (because of their low market share, U.S. carriers receive      only 20 percent of this subsidy). The Federal Maritime      Commission disputes these results, and asserts that      Conferences have little effect on long-term shipping prices.       Shippers continue to press for relief from strictures      imposed by the Act, and are likely to try and block any new      subsidies for carriers without some action to address their      concerns. The law regulating conferences was last amended in      1984. In 1990, the Advisory Commission on Conferences in      Ocean Shipping brought together carriers shippers to seek      consensus on further changes to the Act. No agreement was      reached.     Tab B: U.S. Shipbuilding and Current Administration Efforts          to Assist the Industry       Large U.S. shipyards are now almost completely dependent on      the Navy. Of the 87 ships currently on order or under      construction, 86 are for the Navy. With the drawdown in      defense spending, naval orders are expected to decline      substantially. The problems faced by U.S. shipyards are thus      similar to those faced by other defense contractors--namely,      how to shift from military to civilian production.       The U.S. industry is currently not competitive in the      global market. It is less efficient than its foreign      competitors and has had little experience in the commercial      market since the early 1980s when the U.S. ended construction      differential subsidies and increased naval orders. U.S. yards      are also disadvantaged by the subsidies granted by foreign      governments to their own shipyards. As a result, U.S.--built      ships are more expensive than foreign-built ships. According      to the ITC, price differentials have reached 100 percent.       The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that U.S.      shipyards employed 123,900 workers in 1992 (down from 171,600      in 1982). The shipbuilding industry estimates that, absent      government assistance, 70,000 more shipbuilding jobs could be      lost. Even with government assistance, however, shipbuilders      estimate that the transition from military to civilian      production will lead to a loss of 20 percent of current      employees as some skills will no loner be needed.            Actions Currently Underway by the Administration       All agencies support the following Administration efforts      now underway:       1. Seek to Reinvigorate Negotiations to Eliminate Foreign      Shipbuilding Subsidies. U.S. negotiators are currently      engaged in efforts to restart negotiations on the elimination      of foreign subsidies. The elimination of such subsidies has      been one of the key objectives of the U.S. shipbuilding      industry.       2. Explore the Possibility of Working with Congress on      Legislation to Support this Effort. In the last Congress,      bills were introduced in both the House and the Senate      providing the means to retaliate against ship carriers who      purchased subsidized foreign-built vessels. These measures      are intended to speed multinational agreement on the      elimination of foreign shipbuilding subsidies. Agencies are      exploring the possibility of working with Congress on      legislation this year.       3. Prepare Congressionally-Mandated Plan for the U.S.      Shipbuilding Industry. The FY 1993 National Defense      Authorization Act required the Administration to establish a      working group charged with preparing a plan to help U.S.      shipbuilding industry become competitive in international      commercial markets. The working group is considering a series      of measures, including the use of Title XI loan guarantees      for ship construction, defense conversion funds, ARPA R&D      projects, and Export-Import financing. The group will present      its proposals to the relevant Cabinet members this summer, so      that the Administration can submit a plan to the Congress by      the statutory deadline of October 1, 1993.     Tab C: Differing Views on U.S.-Flag Ships Engaged in Foreign          Trade                           Political Concerns       (1) Strength of Congressional Support: Secretary Pena      believes there to be broad, bipartisan Congressional support      for maritime subsidies. The Secretary believes that maritime      supporters have enough votes to pass a maximalist package      without support from the Administration. If you do not      announce such a package now, the Secretary fears that you      will lose an opportunity to demonstrate leadership.       The Director of OMB disagrees with this assessment. In the      current budget environment, he believes that there will be      far less support for direct and indirect maritime subsidies.      He argues that Congress might even reduce the level of      subsidies, including those indirect subsidies that come at      the expense of other industries, such as agriculture and      manufacturing.       (2) The Political Cost of Delay: A number of maritime bills      have been introduced in Congress. To date, the Administration      has delayed taking a position on these bills pending the      completion of its review of maritime policies. Secretary Pena      believes that further delay will generate ill feelings on the      Hill.       (3) Congress will Support Subsidies to Ship Operators Only      If Immediate Subsidies Are Provided to Shipyards: Secretary      Pena believes that no new direct subsidy program      can pass in Congress without including immediate new funding for      shipyards.                           Economic Concerns       (1) DOT: Without a U.S.-flag fleet engaged in foreign      trade, U.S. exporters would be held hostage to the fleet of      nations with which we might have trade disputes.       Other Agencies: The worldwide carrier industry is highly      competitive, making the possibility of being held hostage      highly remote. Moreover, U.S. exporters will always be able      to ship cargo on U.S.-owned, foreign-flagged ships (although      these ships have foreign crews, they are owned and controlled      by U.S. interests).       The Alliance for Competitive Transport, the coalition of      major American exporters and importers, has made clear that      it does not believe that its interests would be harmed by the      reflagging of the Merchant Marine, as long as the ships      remained U.S. owned and controlled.       (2) DOT: A new ten-year program will lead to increased      efficiencies in the Merchant Marine that will make further      subsidies unnecessary.       Other Agencies: Subsidies are needed principally to offset      the higher wages of U.S. mariners. DOT has presented no      evidence that this program would eliminate the wage      differential between U.S. carriers and their foreign      competitors.       (3) DOT: The government must subsidize more ships than it      needs for defense purposes or risk crippling the commercial      shipping industry in times of military emergency.       Other Agencies: U.S. ship operators will enter contingency      contracts only if they believe that yielding their ships to      the government in times of emergency will not cripple their      commercial operations. If their ships were used during      emergencies, ship operators would continue operations through      their U.S. owned, foreign-flag affiliates, and by contracting      out to foreign owned companies.       (4) Department of Transportation: Some maritime supporters      will argue that DOD is not meeting its defense needs in the      most cost-effective manner. Critics will claim that DOD plans      to spend $6-7 billion over the next few years to purchase      ``roll-on, roll-off'' (RORO) ships with a sealift capacity      that could be purchased more cheaply through subsidies to      maintain a large U.S.-flag Merchant Marine.       Department of Defense: DOD will spend $4.5 billion between      now and the year 2000 to acquire RORO ships. However, these      ROROs are not available in the current commercial fleet, nor      would these ships become available under any new liner      subsidy program. ROROs are specialized ships that allow rapid      loading/unloading of vehicles and can achieve high speed on      the open ocean. Reliance on the Merchant Marine to serve the      specialized function of ROROs would seriously compromise      DOD's ability to deploy U.S. forces in time to meet      anticipated threats overseas.
