President, I also note that 2 years ago, the Congress directed the Government Accountability Office to evaluate the DC TAG program to determine whether adequate controls are in place to protect the Federal interest, such as those pertaining to student eligibility, cash management, and administrative expenses, as well as assess relevant performance and demographic information.  I understand that the GAO's work on this mandated study may be in its final stages, and that a written report is anticipated soon. To the extent that GAO identifies any particular concerns which may put the DC TAG program and the Federal taxpayer dollars it receives at risk, I would urge that in response, the Mayor take immediate steps to promptly correct any identified weaknesses in the operations and financial management of the program, and advise the Congress of the District's plans and outcomes.  Additionally, to the extent that the GAO findings and recommendations are available in advance of the conference on this bill, I would recommend that the conference agreement include explicit directives to the Mayor and other appropriate District officials to address the GAO findings in order to help bolster the future fiscal management of this program without inordinate delay.  Furthermore, it would be prudent, prior to our consideration of the FY 2007 funding request for this program, that the District of Columbia appropriations subcommittee conduct a comprehensive oversight hearing on the DC TAG program. This could provide a forum to not only showcase the program's accomplishments and strengths, but to identify any weaknesses in the fiscal operations, program policies, and managerial structure which affect the efficient and effective use of Federal funds. It may afford an opportunity to collaborate with the authorizing committee to ensure that any necessary legislative and administrative reforms can be instituted. Any efforts we can take to improve this program as it matures and continues to benefit District residents in their educational pursuits will be time well spent.                               Exhibit 1                                                    July 20, 2005.     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,     Subcommittee on the District of Columbia, Senate Committee on          Appropriations, Dirksen Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Durbin: I would like to thank you for your      long history of support for the District of Columbia Tuition      Assistance Grant Program (DCTAG). As a result of your      leadership for both the authorization and significant      appropriations for this most beneficial program, DCTAG has      helped more than 8,000 students throughout the District of      Columbia attend college.       The program's success has necessarily and predictably      resulted in rising costs and I acknowledge your concerns      about the rate of growth in program costs over the last two      years. Moreover, I acknowledge your concerns about our      current out-year cost projections. I can assure you that the      last two years' requests for significant appropriations      increase will not occur again. These increases were largely      the result of two factors: 1) the program's annual carryover      is virtually depleted meaning that we must request the actual      operating costs (rather than relying, in part, on carryover      surpluses) and 2) the program has been adding entire classes      of students during its implementation phase (and we no longer      will be adding new cohorts or categories of newly eligible      persons.)       As Mayor, I am committed to undertaking measures to reduce      the current cost projections in FY 07 and beyond, including:      Negotiating tuition decreases based upon volume of students;      aligning program requirements in line with those of the U.S.      Department of Education; and revising maximum award      calculations based on type of school.       Program officials have already discussed these scenarios      with the authorizers and after appropriate consultation with      you and others, we will begin to implement a range of cost      containment measures. Attached is a copy of my testimony last      month before the DC appropriations subcommittee which      reiterates this commitment.       I once again thank you for support of the DCTAG program.      This program has had a demonstrable impact on the quality of      life for thousands of District families, Were it not for this      program, the dream of a college education would not be a      reality for many of these families. My staff and I are eager      to continue our partnership with you and your staff in the      management of this program to the benefit of the citizens of      the District of Columbia.           Sincerely,                                              Anthony A. Williams,                                                            Mayor.
