Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman. I thank her for her leadership, and I can assure our colleagues that this is not the last they have heard from us on this issue, either on the Mexican bailout and the new attempts by the President to end run the Congress, or the Federal Reserve and their incessant increases in interest rates driving thousands of Americans out of work.                          ____________________
