President, during his 36 years representing Michigan in the Senate, Senator Carl Levin's character and expertise have been described in many ways. He has been named by Time magazine as one of the 10 best Senators. He has been hailed by our military as a leader on national security. He is recognized by families in Michigan and throughout our country as a dedicated champion for economic opportunity and fairness.  But perhaps the best description of Senator Levin's philosophy of public service is a word he himself used in an interview for the George Mitchell Oral History Project at Bowdoin College in Maine. That word is ``fiduciary.''  It is the word that embraces the concepts of trust and confidence, of ethics and responsibility. In that interview Senator Levin elaborated on what the word means to him as a public servant. He said it meant to be accessible and open, to listen to other points of view, and to be well informed.
