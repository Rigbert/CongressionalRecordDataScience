 President, I just have to say I am really confused by this because what we have offered is simply what the Republicans agreed to--offered Monday night, and I have come back to offer it again. It is perplexing to me on an issue that is so important to my State, and to several other States, that we can't now, a few days later, do this. So I am not sure we are not just having games about this. It is extremely important to people in my State, and I am deeply disconcerted that the Republicans have not agreed to allow us to just pass the State sales tax deduction for 1 year.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
