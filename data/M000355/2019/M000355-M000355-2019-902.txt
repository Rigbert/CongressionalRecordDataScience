 President, I welcome all Members back to the Senate for a busy week, but first there is something I need to address.  Over the last several days, I was called unpatriotic, ``un-American,'' and essentially treasonous by a couple of leftwing pundits on the basis of bold-faced lies. I was accused of ``aiding and abetting'' the very man I have singled out as an adversary and opposed for nearly 20 years: Vladimir Putin. This was less than 24 hours after the outraged industrial complex was disappointed yet again by Special Counsel Mueller.  Partisan Democrats and their media allies were crushed a few months ago, when Mueller's report cleared the President of conspiring with Russia during the 2016 campaign. Now their frantic hyping of the special counsel's congressional testimony has fallen flat once again, but the conspiracy theories and reckless accusations had to continue. Too many people had invested too much time in the hysterical echo chamber to simply wind it down and join the rest of us in the real world.                          ____________________
