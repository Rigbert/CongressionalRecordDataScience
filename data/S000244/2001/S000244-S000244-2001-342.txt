Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) has questioned the Subcommittee on the Constitution considering this bill and has said that this is a wholesale assault on the constitutional rights granted women by Roe v. Wade. He is wrong.  Twenty-four States have statutes similar to the one that is being considered today. If those statutes which protect the rights of unborn children were such an assault on the mother's constitutional right, every one of them would have been struck down by a Federal court, from the District Court to the Supreme Court level. They have not been, because it is not an assault on the constitutional right of a woman to choose.  Then we just heard from the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Millender-McDonald) that this strips away women's reproductive rights. I would submit to the gentlewoman from California that, if the woman wanted to have an abortion, she would have had an abortion before the assault took place. In these cases that this bill will protect, the woman wants to have her child born.                              {time}  1115  So she has already made her choice, and that was for the child to be born. If someone takes away that child's right to life through an assault or through a murder, then that person, that criminal, ought to be prosecuted twice. You do not want the criminal prosecuted twice when the woman has chosen to bring that child to term and have that child born alive.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart).
