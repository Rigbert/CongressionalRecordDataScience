President, I thank the Senator for allowing me to ask a question. I thank him also for offering the amendment. It is a valuable part of the debate. Parenthetically, I concur completely with the Senator from Texas in the fact that many States are doing very positive things to deal with this issue, and I think it would be wise for us to look to their leadership in some of these areas. Secondly, I think he feels as I do, that the underlying trust fund has some fundamental flaws.  I yield the floor.
