Speaker, this is the Contract With America. This is a Contract With America, and I have looked at the fine print, and it does not say we are going to increase the taxes on 2 million people. It does not have a provision which says that on 2,000,000 of our employees' families you are going to have to tax increase. It does not say to those that are working for the Federal Government and our employees in this House, ``If you make $20,000, you're going to have a $500 tax increase; if you make 30, you're going to have a $750 increase; if you make 40, a thousand dollar increase, and if you make 50, a $1,250 tax increase so we can give a tax cut for the wealthiest of America.''  ``Now Steny Hoyer has a lot of Federal employees.'' My colleagues are saying, ``This is a tax increase; we don't believe it.''  Let me quote Gerald Solomon, chairman of the Committee on Rules: ``I have to agree with you that this is a case where we are raising taxes on some to pay for tax cuts for others,'' and that to me says Chairman Solomon is wrong.                          ____________________
