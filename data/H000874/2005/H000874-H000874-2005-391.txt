Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the leader for his comments and observations. We are certainly hopeful on our side, and I know the gentleman is on his side, that we get this bill through. It is probably as significant a jobs creation bill as we will pass in this Congress, and it has been delayed for a very long period of time. I know the gentleman has been frustrated by it, and we have been frustrated by it, and hopefully, we can get that done by next week.  The energy bill conference report, can the gentleman tell us where that stands? I yield to my friend.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. We are working on it. We hope to get it done by the end of next week. It is a very ambitious goal, I must say, to take a bill of this magnitude and, in a matter of 2 weeks, get all the differences worked out between the House and the Senate and bring it to the floor.  This is another item that the House and Senate are working on through the weekend, and at least encouragement has been brought to my attention by the chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce that, with a lot of hard work, it is very possible that we could get this energy conference report to the Members for a vote by the end of next week.
