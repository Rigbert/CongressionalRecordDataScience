In the State of Ohio, we literally, in the last month and a half, have had students arrested. I have not seen this in a couple generations. Arrested in our capital city of Columbus, concerned about the fact that what you said, Congressman Sanders, that the cost of their loans would be going up even more than they have already gone up, that they would have to be paying interest on their borrowings immediately. And we know that even now most of the students that graduate, graduate in huge debt. And when they graduate, what kind of a job can they go to?                              {time}  2320  A lot of them are going into jobs that are $14,000-a-year jobs, and they are shocked even with a college degree at how little they earn. I know I have talked to people from Congressman Field's State, women who work on those shrimp, in those shrimp operations where they are doing I do not know how many hundreds of those things an hour, they all get carpal tunnel syndrome by the time they are in their mid 30s, and they are making about 3 bucks an hour. Now, those are working people and yet they do not earn a living wage, so whether you are a college graduate in this country, loaded up with debt and the contract says we are going to load you up with more debt and more interest or whether you are working in a shrimping operation in Louisiana or in a dry cleaners shop in Toledo, HO, you can't earn a living wage even if you work 40 hours a week.
