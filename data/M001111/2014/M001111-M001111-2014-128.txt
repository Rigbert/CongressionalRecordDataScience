 President, I would like to pay tribute to a strong community leader, dedicated public servant, and advocate from the State of Washington, Val Ogden.  Val was a longtime friend and I would not be where I am today without her support.  She was a community advocate, in the truest and strongest sense of the word, and she was a champion for women and children.  She was a member of the Washington State House of Representatives, serving as speaker pro tempore.  Val was a leader for her community, securing funding for Washington State University Vancouver. She was a strong Democrat and very active in the Clark County Democratic Party. Val served as the executive director of the Clark County YWCA.  But you can't talk about Val without talking about her husband of 67 years, Dan. They were a team and were always working together to make their community a better place to live.  Val was also a very dedicated mother and grandmother. Along with Dan, she is survived by three children: Dan, Janeth and Patti, six grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.  She will be missed by many but her legacy and leadership lives on.  Mr. President, I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in paying homage to Val Ogden. She lived a full life and our thoughts are with her loved ones at this time of great loss.                          ____________________
