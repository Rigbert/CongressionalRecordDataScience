Speaker, I certainly will accommodate our friend from Georgia, but let me say, as someone who has worked very, very closely with the gentleman from Pennsylvania for many, many years, he has been the leader in this Congress on the formation, and the growth, and flourishing of the Fire Service Caucus. He has been a leader in foreign affairs, a leader on the Committee on Armed Services, and a leader in so many other efforts on behalf of his constituents and on behalf of this country.  I want him to, however, in this period of time when we are--because he is such an able Member--when we are contending so heartily here, Mr. Speaker, I want him to rest, and I want him to take care of himself, not work those 7 days a week, 20-hour days that he has been working, and I want to say we welcome you back on this side of the aisle.  I have often said that it is unfortunate that people see us on this floor usually contending about the 20 percent of the issues that are contentious and we have disagreements on, and they sometimes, I think, believe that we do not interact with one another as human beings, as colleagues, and as people who care about this country and work together on an overwhelming majority of issues to make our country a better place for our children, our constituents, and all Americans, and so I join with, I know, my other colleagues in welcoming Curt Weldon from Pennsylvania back to the House. We share his joy and the joy of his family that the genius of medical technology has enabled him to come back whole and indeed from those with whom I have talked to have had this operating feeling much better than he did before, and I am confident that he is going to continue to be one of the most able, involved, effective Members in this body.
