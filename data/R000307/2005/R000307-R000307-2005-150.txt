President, I am delighted to yield 10 minutes to the distinguished chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee whose unflagging, untiring, persevering efforts, along with her coauthor, Senator Lieberman, led to passage of the Intelligence Reform Act that has returned us to this whole process where we have Ambassador Negroponte and General Hayden, an outstanding team, not only to reform but to lead the intelligence community.  I thank the Senator for her leadership and her efforts. She persevered, and she was successful.
