 President, today I wish to congratulate Christine Henneberg of Palo Alto, CA, for winning Second Prize in the prestigious Elie Wiesel Prize in Ethics Essay Contest. This represents a tremendous achievement, and I am pleased to recognize her today.  Rooted in the memory of the Holocaust, Elie Wiesel and his wife, Marion, started the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity to combat indifference, intolerance, and injustice through international and youth-focused programs. Each year, they sponsor the Prize in Ethics Essay Contest to challenge college students to analyze the urgent ethical issues confronting them in today's world. Now in its 17th year, the contest encourages our Nation's students to submit personal essays that raise questions, single out issues, and are compelling arguments for ethical action.  As a senior at Pomona College in California, Christine entered the national essay contest under the sponsorship of Pomona College Professor of Philosophy N. Ann Davis. In her prize winning essay, ``The God on my Grandfather's Table,'' Christine explores the role of the elderly in our society and the implications of the unfortunate and frequent negative perception of the elderly.  Chosen from over hundreds of essays from more than 200 colleges and universities nationwide, Christine's work demonstrates her tremendous maturity and devotion to important issues facing our society.  Christine now plans to attend medical school. I want to wish her the best there and in all she does. She has made our great State proud, and I am happy to commend her today.                          ____________________
