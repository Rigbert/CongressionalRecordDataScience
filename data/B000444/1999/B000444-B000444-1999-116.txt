 President, I am anxious to respond point by point to my friend. I suggest, to believe his arguments, as the old saying goes, requires the suspension of disbelief. I find them to be well intended but half true. I will be very specific about each one of them, beginning with this notion of the value of deterrence.  I find it fascinating, my colleagues talk about these other nations can have a Hiroshima-type bomb and build without testing and that would radically affect our security; yet we cannot rely in the future on our certainty of 6,000 sophisticated nuclear weapons in the stockpile. I urge my friends to read today's New York Times and Washington Post where our allies are apoplectic about the fact my colleagues are going to reject this treaty.  The absolute notion that this idea is--don't let them kid you about this debate, folks, anybody watching this. You do not have to be a nuclear scientist to understand. You do not have to be a sophisticated foreign policy specialist to grasp what is at stake.  Think of it this way when they tell you the security of our nuclear stockpile is going to become so unreliable over time, that, as Dr. Schlesinger has said and my friend from Arizona has alluded, our enemies are going to know we do not have confidence in it and that is going to embolden them, and our allies such as Germany and Japan are going to go nuclear because they cannot count on us.  That is fascinating. Why did all of our allies sign and ratify this treaty? Why are they apoplectic about the prospect that we will not sign this treaty? I ask my colleagues when is the last time they can remember the Prime Minister of Great Britain or the President of France saying publicly: My Lord, I hope the Senate doesn't do that.  You cannot have it both ways. This is an argument that I find absolutely preposterous. Although one can technically make it, it does require the suspension of disbelief in order to arrive at that conclusion.  One has to be an incredible pessimist to conclude that the 6,000 nuclear weapons configured in nine different warheads are going to atrophy after spending $45 billion over the next 10 years, and after having been able to certify without testing for the last 3 years that it is in good shape, that some nation is going to say: We got them now, guys; I know they don't believe their system is adequate; maybe one of those bombs won't go off, maybe 10 of them, maybe 100 of them, maybe 1,000 of them, maybe 3,000 of them.  We still have 3,000 left. Back when the Senator from Nebraska and I were kids and Vietnam was kicking up, we used to see bumper stickers: One atom bomb can ruin your day.  I am going to go into great detail on every point my friend raised and talk about, for example, the idea we cannot modernize these weapons when we find a defect; we cannot deal with them without testing.  Dr. Garwin yesterday--one of the most brilliant scientists we have had, who has been involved in this program since 1950--says, you can replace the whole physics package without changing.  By the way, I am going to yield to my friend from Pennsylvania.  Names are mentioned here: Dr. Robinson, of Sandia; Victor Reis, the architect of the program, whom I spent 2\1/2\ hours with the other day. They do not tell you the end of the sentence. The end of the sentence is: They both are for this treaty. They both are for this treaty, along with 32 Nobel laureates in physics. I ask unanimous consent that the list be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 A Letter From Physics Nobel Laureates     To Senators of the 106th Congress:       We urge you to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.       The United States signed and ratified the Limited Test Ban      Treaty in 1963. In the years since, the nation has played a      leadership role in actions to reduce nuclear risks, including      the Non-Proliferation Treaty extension, the ABM Treaty,      STARTs I and II, and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty      negotiations. Fully informed technical studies have concluded      that continued nuclear testing is not required to retain      confidence in the safety, reliability and performance of      nuclear weapons in the United States' stockpile, provided      science and technology programs necessary for stockpile      stewardship are maintained.       The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is central to future      efforts to halt the spread of nuclear weapons. Ratification      of the Treaty will mark an important advance in uniting the      world in an effort to contain and reduce the dangers of      nuclear arms. It is imperative that the CTBT be ratified.         Philip W. Anderson, Princeton University, 1977 Nobel            Prize; Hans A.
