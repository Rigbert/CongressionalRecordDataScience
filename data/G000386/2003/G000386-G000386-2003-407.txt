 President, we want to give seniors the right to choose in as many areas as we can. That is why I use the word ``voluntary.'' And that is why I use the phrase ``the right to choose what they might consider better Medicare programs than traditional.''  Our bill specifically authorizes provider organizations to participate in Medicare. The idea is these kinds of lightly managed care plans more closely resemble the kinds of plans that we choose for the Federal Government and which close to 50 percent of working Americans have today but only 13 percent of the people in Medicare have that today.  Preferred provider organizations have the advantage of offering the same benefit of traditional Medicare, including prescription drugs, but on an integrated, coordinated basis. This bill creates new opportunities for chronic disease management and access to innovative new therapies.  PPOs might not be right for everyone. We are going to let seniors make that choice. Our bill sets up a playing field for preferred provider organizations to compete for beneficiaries. We believe PPOs can be competitive and offer stronger, more enhanced benefits.  In the days ahead, I will be working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that we set up the right system, one that is truly competitive and viable for these preferred provider organizations. No senior has to choose this new program. Our prevailing policy has been, and always will be, one that lets seniors keep what they have if they like it with no changes. All the seniors, regardless of whether they choose a PPO or not, can still get prescription drugs.  We have 2 long weeks ahead of us. My commitment is to stay here until the lights go out to ensure that we pass a balanced bipartisan bill.  I thank my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee for their fine work to get us this far.  I yield the floor.
