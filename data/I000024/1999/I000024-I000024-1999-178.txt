 Let me first share some ideas that perhaps have not been discussed. I have done a lot of crossing off as I have listened today, taking off items I was going to discuss, and I have shortened my remarks and probably won't use all of my time.  First of all, months ago I went to Kosovo when I saw the handwriting on the wall, when I felt that ultimately this President was going to send ground troops into Kosovo. In spite of the fact he continuously said he was not going to, I felt very strongly that he was. I went over to find out as much as I could before all of the bombing started, what it was really like in Kosovo. Truly, Milosevic is just as bad a person as everybody says he is. I do not question that. But one of the things I came back with is a knowledge of a little bit of the history of the area and that some of the people over there are bad, too.  For example, you are talking about Kosovo, which is very small. It is about 75 miles in diameter, surrounded by mountains and for 600 years has been an area that has strived unsuccessfully for autonomy. There have been times when the Albanians have been the bad guys and the Serbs have been the good guys, and vice versa. It was about 12 years ago we were all so concerned because the KLA was doing all the raping and looting and burning, and not the Serbs.  Also, I noticed only two dead people in the road going across Kosovo. I turned them over. They ended up being Serbs. They were killed by the KLA. They were executed at point-blank range.  Rounding a corner about 10 minutes later, I saw someone--I found myself in the sights of a rifle-propelled grenade, an RPG-7, a very lethal weapon. After they put it down, we walked over, and it was the KLA, it wasn't the Serbs.  I went on and we saw on the map a place called the ``no-go zone.'' I asked what it was. They said that is where you do not go. They do not care whether you are a United States Senator or whether you are a Serb or an Albanian; if you go in there, you are going to be shot. It was controlled by the KLA.  I guess what I am saying, Madam President, is there are bad guys on both sides.  I would like to just mention one thing about the China scandal, because I see a connection here. I hate to say this, but a couple of months ago on this floor I told the history of what had happened in the China scandal and the fact that back in the 1980s the technology known as the WA-8 technology was stolen and nobody knew about it until about 1995. The administration--the President and the administration found out about it and they withheld that from Congress for quite a number of years--not months but years. So in Senator Warner's committee we started having some hearings to find out what the truth was.  Sometimes I remember that Winston Churchill said:       Truth is incontrovertible. Panic may rescind it, ignorance      may deride it, malice may destroy it, but there it is.  Ultimately you get to that truth. That is what we are trying to get. And Notra Trulock, who was in charge of the intelligence for the Department of Energy--he said it became very serious a year ago--said we are going to have to tell Congress about this. So he wanted to come. He had to go to his superior, who was the Acting Director of the Department of Energy, Betsy Moler. And she said: No, you can't do that. You can't do that because it might be detrimental to the President's China policy.  Here we are talking about the theft of the most significant nuclear device in our arsenal, the WA-8 warhead. To give you an idea what it is, Madam President, this is something that has 10 times the explosive power of the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima. It is a fraction of the size. The Chinese actually had missiles that were aimed at us at that time, at the time the President was running around the country, 133 times, saying: For the first time in the nuclear age there is not one missile aimed at American children--when in fact we had some 28 cities that were being targeted at that time. He signed the waiver to allow the Chinese to have a guidance technology to make those missiles more accurate, and he had knowledge of the fact they had, now, the warhead, the WA-8 warhead, that could be fitted on one of these. As a matter of fact, more than one could be fitted on one of their multiple-stage rockets.  I say that there is a connection. There is always talk about the President, every time he gets in trouble, something big happens, like sending cruise missiles into Sudan or Afghanistan or Iraq. In this case, we started a war. But I will say this--I do not want to dwell on this because that is not the subject at hand today--I see a connection. I believe there is a connection. I think we may very well have a ``Wag The Dog'' situation here. I think everyone knows what I am talking about. They do not say it, but they know what I am talking about.  But I did ask, in the committee meeting, since we had two diametrically opposed testimonies coming from Mr. Trulock and Ms. Moler, if they would submit to a lie detector test. Mr. Trulock immediately said he would; Ms. Moler vacillated. And then, in response to a letter, I found he is willing and she said she is not. So I think I know who is telling the truth. Nonetheless, we are going to have to address that in a little bit different way.  We have learned since then, by the way, in the last 6 years, virtually everything in our nuclear arsenal is now in the hands of the Chinese.  What I would like to do is cover this in four areas that have not been discussed by previous speakers. I thinkthey are significant. First of all, some of the things this President has said that led us to where we are today. The President does have an insatiable propensity to say things that are not true, and he does it with such conviction that people start nodding and agreeing with him. I am not going into the details on that; everybody knows about that.  But one of the things that I think had the greatest impact on the American people in supporting the President to send our assets in there and get involved in a war of a sovereign nation, in a civil war--the first time we have done that, certainly the first time in 50 years that NATO has done that--was when he started talking about the history of World War I and World War II. He gave a very persuasive story of how World War I and World War II started. The only trouble is, he was not telling the truth. I am not a historian and neither is the President, but I will tell you who is: Henry Kissinger. He said he got quite upset with the thing. I am quoting now. He said:       The Second World War did not start in the Balkans, much      less as a result of its ethnic conflicts.  Then he said:       World War I started in the Balkans not as a result of      ethnic conflicts but for precisely the opposite reason:      because outside powers intervened in a local conflict.  He said:       Russia backed Serbia and France backed Russia . . ..  And then Germany jumped in on Austria's side. So we had the same situation as is happening today. We had the great powers dividing up and getting on both sides of this, a civil war. It was a civil war, just like it is today. If that started World War I, certainly that could start World War III.  So what he said to the American people just simply was not true, Madam President. I think we need to talk about that.  The Senator from Washington just a few minutes ago talked about the article by Charles Krauthammer. I think that was very significant, when he talked about the Russians. It is already submitted for the Record so I will not resubmit it, but I will read a few things out of it. He said:       Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov turned his U.S.-bound plane      around in mid-transit to protest the bombing.                           *   *   *   *   *       Russia kicked NATO's representatives out of Moscow. It sent      a spy ship into the Adriatic to shadow the U.S. fleet. It      threatened to send military supplies to Belgrade. It      boycotted NATO's 50th-year summit in Washington.  I don't know what we could have done that could have precipitated more of a problem between us and Russia than has already been done by this President in getting involved in war.  The last paragraph reads:       Most important, Primakov will have proved to the world--and      to pro-Western Russians--that an anti-American foreign policy      puts Russia back on the stage and gives it diplomatic clout,      while the pro-American policy followed since the Gulf War      yielded Russia nothing but a ticket to oblivion.       We will have vindicated Primakov's vision of Russia as      leader of the opposition, friend and broker of rogue regimes      [like] Serbia and Iraq [and] balancer of American power. This      might even get him elected president next year when Yeltsin's      term expires.       Clinton will finally have his legacy.  I would like to make one comment also to clarify the Record. I know Senator McCain said this does not authorize ground troops. But it does authorize whatever force necessary, and some of us could interpret it that way. But in my opinion, the President has always known that there were going to have to be ground troops. I know he said he is opposed to ground troops, but he wasn't telling the truth. I offer as evidence of that what, long before we sent bombers in there, General Wesley Clark said.       We never thought air power alone could stop the      paramilitary tragedy. . . everyone understood it.  When he said that, he was with the President of the United States.  We had Secretary Bill Cohen, a man I have a great deal of respect for and served with here in this body, in the Senate, but I asked him the same question about this, and he elaborated a little bit on it, but he said we understood that Milosevic:       . . . could take action very quickly and that an air      campaign could do little, if anything, to stop him.  So when people talk about this resolution doing that, I think this is what the President had in mind all the time anyway.  The second thing I wanted to talk about is the cost of this thing. A lot of people have not realized, they do not stop and think about, the cost in terms of both money and our capability of defending America. I do not think there is anyone who is not going to stand up here and agree with me in this Senate that the President, through his veto power, has decimated the military budget so we right now, today, are at one-half the force strength that we were in 1991, back during the Persian Gulf days. That is very significant. I think people need to hear this and understand it: One-half the force strength. I am talking about one-half the Army divisions, one-half the tactical air wings, one-half the ships, from 600 down to 300.  We are one-half the force strength that we were because of this President. Add to that the deployments. We have had more deployments in the last 6 years than the previous 20 years to areas where we do not have any national security interests. We need to look at that. For Joe Lockhart, the Press Secretary of the President, to stand up last week and say that Inhofe is wrong, we are as strong today as we were in 1991, that is just an outrageous lie, and it is quantified in force strength. Anyone who is working on the committees understands this.  We have the deployments, we have the problems, and we are paying the price. Yet, we do not have the national security interests. I was so proud of Colin Powell this weekend to come out and admit that America does not have national strategic interests in Kosovo, the same as Henry Kissinger said. I have quoted both of them extensively. Yet, here we are making the commitment.  I came back from my last trip to Kosovo just to hear Tony Blair stand up and make his very eloquent statement: We want to escalate the war, escalate the airstrikes. Here is a guy standing up who does have national security interests. He is over there; we are halfway around the world. We do not have strategic interests there, but he does. He stood up and said we need to escalate the airstrikes when, at the time he said this, we had 365 airplanes over there and they had 20. That is easy for him to say. I say he is a better negotiator than we are.  I was very much concerned with what I saw over there. I see several members of the committee here. I have to say that sometimes the NATO interests do not necessarily coincide with our interests. I wonder sometimes what has happened to sovereignty in the United States of America, why we have to take on all these other obligations at the expense of our ability to defend ourselves.  Can we defend ourselves? Again, General Hawley was very brave when he, this weekend, said--keep in mind he is the air combat commander, the top guy, a four-star general. It takes a lot of courage for one of these generals to stand up against the Commander in Chief, President Clinton.  He said that 5 weeks of bombing in Yugoslavia has left U.S. munitions stocks critically short, not just of air-launched cruise missiles, as previously reported, but also of another precision weapon, the joint direct attack munition--that is JDAM--dropped, used by these beautiful B-2s that are performing very well. Now we are short of them.  He went on to say we would be hard pressed to handle a second war in the Middle East or Korea. Let's stop and think about that a little bit. Our national military strategy has always been to be able to defend America on two regional fronts. I do not think there is anyone in here who believes we can simultaneously defend America on two regional fronts.  What General Hawley is saying on the commitments we have made to Bosnia and Kosovo and with the deployments we have made there is we would have a very difficult time. And he questions whether we could defend America if something happened in either North Korea or in Iraq. That is very serious.  I went back to the 21st TACOM, and I know people are tired of hearing me talk about that, but any time we do a ground operation anywhere in that theater, it has to be logistically supportedand run and operated by the 21st TACOM in Germany, down the road from Ramstein Air Force Base.  A year or so ago, I was over there. They said just with what we are doing in Bosnia, we are at 100 percent capacity; we cannot do anymore. And now they are doing more.  As I watched the deployments take place and they were cranking these troops through--5,000 were there a few days ago --as they were taken through, I said: What are you going to do if there is any contingency like in Iraq?  They said: We would be 100 percent dependent on Guard and Reserve.  We know the President's intentions are to activate the Guard and Reserve. He has already called up units. He has notified units.  Anyway, we do not have the capacity. I went over, Madam President, to Tirana, where our troops are, in a C-17. I found some things out there that were really kind of scary. The C-17 I went in was carrying two MLRSs, that is the mobile launch capability, and one humvee, and all the rest filled up with troops. We were at gross weight. We could not hold another pound in that C-17.  We have now done 300 sorties with C-17s. That is the beautiful high-lift vehicle that is going to replace a lot of the others of which we don't have enough and need more. Nonetheless, we are tying those things up. Four hundred of them are going in and out, taking things into Albania.  Then we have our scenarios as to what the cost is going to be. I will only say this. I came back convinced that the paper that was written by the Heritage Foundation was true, because from the officers over there, I learned three scenarios, which are: The most conservative scenario, go in and take over Kosovo, as if you can do that and nothing else is going to happen; second, take over Belgrade; third, take over Yugoslavia.  The first scenario would take 30,000 American troops; the second scenario, 100,000 American troops; the third scenario, 250,000 American troops. While they do not like to think in terms of casualties, casualties under the most conservative scenario would be somewhere between 500 and 2,000 American casualties; the Belgrade option would be somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 casualties; and the Yugoslavia total effort would be somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000 American casualties. That is very, very serious.  Before I quit, I have two other things I want to share. I have heard many Senators stand on this floor and talk about the horrible atrocities that are going on, and they are. Anytime anyone is killed, anytime there are refugees, anytime there is any degree of ethnic cleansing, it is a tragedy.  For the junior Senator from California to stand up and say, ``the most God-awful ethnic cleansing since Hitler,'' just is not true. I am sure she believes it is true or she would not say it.  We keep hearing these horrible stories. We heard the President walk out into the Rose Garden last week and talk about what Brian Atwood, the AID Administrator, told him about the groups of men that were lined up and doused with gasoline and lighted on fire. I was with Brian Atwood over there a few days before that. Apparently, this allegedly happened before that time. He did not tell me about it.  I don't know what is true and is not true. I will say this. I know despite what you hear to the contrary--and this is most significant--the atrocities that have been committed on the Kosovar Albanians are minor when compared to other places.  I am involved in mission work. I go to west Africa with some regularity. I was in west Africa less than a month ago. This does not have anything to do with being a Senator. It is doing the Lord's work in some of these places. I am talking about Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Angola, Nigeria, Sierra Leone. For every one person who has been killed, ethnically cleansed, killed in the Kosovar Albanians, for every one, there have been 80 killed in just the two countries of Angola and Sierra Leone.  Are they as brutal? Yes. They went into Sierra Leone and took whole tribes of people, lined up the children and cut their hands off. Entire tribes, the most brutal killing. For every one killed in Kosovo, 80 were killed there. Why aren't we concerned about that? We have now come to the conclusion that it is humanitarian reasons that are motivating us. What is wrong with the 80-to-1 ratio in west Africa?  What about Rwanda? For every one that has been killed in Kosovo, there have been 300 killed in the one country of Rwanda. You can go throughout Africa and see much greater atrocities.  I don't know why people sit back and act like there is no problem anywhere in the world except there. I have to come to the same conclusion that some of the others have come to. There was an article written in the Minneapolis-St. Paul newspaper that I will submit for the Record at the conclusion of my remarks that is very specific as to why it might be we are not concerned about this many Africans when just a handful are killed in Kosovo.  You have to also ask why are so many killed in Kosovo. We know it is a tragic thing. I have come to the conclusion that it is because of the bombing. I know that George Tenet, who is Director of Central Intelligence for the United States, said long before the bombing started, and this is from the Washington Post of March 31:       For weeks before NATO's air campaign against Yugoslavia,      CIA Director Tenet had been forecasting Serb-led Yugo forces      might respond by accelerating the ethnic cleansing.  I asked the Secretary of Defense, Bill Cohen, before our committee if, in fact, that was true. He said:       With respect to General Tenet testifying that bombing      could, in fact, accelerate Milosevic's plans, we also knew      that.  So we did know that. So I am wondering how many of the Kosovar Albanians are dead today who would be alive if we had not gone in there and bombed.  I have to say also that when I was in Tirana with witnesses, with newspapers, with the media from America--who did not repeat this, by the way--I interviewed everyone I could in that refugee camp outside of Tirana. They were doing all right. They were well fed. They were taken care of. I think they were as well taken care of as you would expect refugees to be. There was not one who said they had any problems until the bombing began.  Then I was interviewed by a Tirana Albanian TV station, and they said, ``When are you and the United States going to come out and take care of all these refugees?'' I said, ``Why us?'' They said, ``Because if it weren't for you, they wouldn't be here.'' That is the way they are thinking there.  I am running out of time. I want to say one thing about the troops.  One of the reasons I went over to be there when the troops arrived is because I saw a New York Times article on April 13 that said, ``We're going into Albania, the middle of nowhere, with no infrastructure, naked and exposed.'' And this was an official who gave this quote. So I went over to see if, in fact, that was what I would find. And you know what? That is exactly what I found.  I went over with the troops. As we unloaded, we went down, and the troops were over there building the tent cities. And, bless their hearts, they are doing a great job. Their spirits are high. They are ready to do whatever their commanding officer tells them to do, which is what they said they would do when they joined the military. They are knee deep in mud, and they are exposed.  I will tell you a little bit about Albania that not many people know about Albania. First of all, it is the poorest country in Europe. Secondly, it is one of the three most dangerous countries anywhere in the world. Thirdly, back during the Hoxha regime, they actually declared it as an atheist nation. So it is the only declared atheist nation out there. And fourth, the pyramid scheme that took place in the middle 1990s was one that actually took over, from the military, all of their weaponry. I am talking about RPG-7s; that is the rifle-propelled grenade, a very lethal weapon; the AK-47s--we know what that is--the SA-7s--that is the shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles; it can knock down our helicopters over there, and every other kind of thing--mortars, other kinds of equipment--and yet our troops are over there standing in the mud without any infrastructure, without any protection, no troop protection. I am very, very concerned about that. If I ever saw a place more ripe for a gradual escalation in mission creep, like Vietnam, this is it.  Some people say, ``Where do you go from here?'' That always bothers me,when people say, ``What are you going to do now?'' If it weren't for us, we would not be where we are today. ``This is something where we were pushed into it. We had no control over it.'' We have a President who decided he was going to declare war, and joined NATO in declaring war, on a sovereign nation.  So there is where we are. But people say, ``If you try something else, our reputation is on the line.'' How is our reputation on the line, if we have tucked our tail between our legs and run from Saddam Hussein in Iraq? Do we have any weapons inspectors there in Iraq anymore? No, we do not. He kicked us out and laughed at us. In the Middle East we are the laughingstock, and our foreign policy. So we cannot do worse than we did before.  I really believe there is no way out, that the only way to keep our President from sending American ground troops in--then it becomes irreversible. Then we are in for the long haul, when that happens. The only way to stop it is, No. 1, today--or tomorrow morning, whenever this comes up for a vote--to join the House with the votes that they voted last week and not give the permission to use any type of force that is necessary; and, secondly, inform the American people.  Let's face it, this administration is poll driven. This administration does what the polls say most people are going to find acceptable. I will repeat and quote General Hawley one more time: ``I would argue we cannot continue to accumulate contingencies,'' he said. ``At some point you have to figure out how to get out of something.''  You see, it is easy to get into something. We learned that in Bosnia, when the President promised it would be 12 months, and then here it is several years later and we are still in there. So this is what we are facing at this time.  So, anyway, I just think we are going to have to reject the McCain resolution. I anticipate we will do that. I think we need to inform the American people what the real threat is, inform the American people as to what our ability to defend America is, where our vital national security interests are, what it really is. If we do that, I think we are going to have the American people behind us.  I think also we have to keep in mind that if we end up saying, ``All right, those of you in Europe who have national security interests at stake, if you want to go ahead and take care of those national security interests, you fight the battle,'' we will go back and we will regroup and we will start rebuilding our military so we can defend America on two regional fronts, and, ``We will protect you against Iraq and against North Korea.'' I think that is probably the greatest thing we could do for our NATO allies.  Whatever the indication, we need to be out of there. This isn't our war, and whatever it takes to get out we should do.  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I understand the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms, is to be recognized for 5 minutes.
