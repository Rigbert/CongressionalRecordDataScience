Speaker, I rise today to honor an extraordinary man, my good friend Dr. Robert Bickford, who is retiring after 27 years as president of Prince George's Community College.  Dr. Bickford began his service to the State of Maryland as a physical education teacher at Maryland Park High School. He then spent 13 years as a physical education teacher at Suitland High School, where he also coached basketball, baseball, lacrosse, football and golf.  In 1962, Dr. Bickford began his tenure with Prince George's Community College as a part-time physical education instructor and has never left. In 1964, Dr. Bickford assumed full-time employment status as the college's director of student activities and director. And, in 1967, he was appointed dean of the evening division, community instruction and summer sessions as the college moved to its new campus in Largo, Maryland.  On November 22, 1972, Dr. Bickford was appointed to the position he currently holds, president of Prince George's Community College.  In his tenure as president of Prince George's Community College, Dr. Bickford has been honored time and time again by the community for his commitment to education. In 1981, he received the Citizen of the Year Award from the Board of Trade of Prince George's County. In 1983, the George Washington University School of Education honored Dr. Bickford with the Outstanding Achievement Award. In 1991, the Prince George's Community College new physical education additionwas aptly named the ``Robert I. Bickford Natatorium.''  But Dr. Bickford's greatest honors lie in the legacy he leaves at Prince George's Community College. During his tenure, the college's budget increased from $7.7 million to $50 million. Annual enrollment increased from approximately 10,000 students to over 35,000 students. He doubled the number of academic programs and greatly increased minority student attendance at the college.  Dr. Bickford has left an indelible mark of excellence on Prince George's Community College, leading it to its greatest level of achievement and success. He has made a profound impact on his students, his colleagues and his community in his many years of service to education in Maryland.  Today, on behalf of the citizens of the Fifth District of Maryland, I offer our thanks and our deepest gratitude for Dr. Bickford's lifelong work to provide a quality education for so many of our residents and I congratulate him on his retirement.                          ____________________
