 President, if there is no further business to come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in adjournment under the previous order.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:25 p.m., adjourned until Thursday, November 17, 2005, at 9:30 a.m.                           ____________________
