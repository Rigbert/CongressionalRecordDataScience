President, I am pleased to join Senator Allen as an original cosponsor in submitting a resolution recognizing the contributions of Korean Americans and encouraging the celebration of ``Korean American Day.''  On January 13, 1903, a group of 102 men, women and children arrived on the shores of Honolulu, HI, after a long journey across the Pacific Ocean from Korea. The story of these pioneers is a familiar one to all of us who trace our roots to a foreign nation.  Like countless other immigrant groups before them, Koreans came to America in search of a better future. Others came to flee a devastating war, repressive government, and poverty. They traded in their sweat equity and homesickness for the priceless opportunity to achieve better economic and educational opportunities and freedom for themselves and for their families in America.  During the past century, the Korean American population has grown to over one million, and Korean Americans now live in every single State of our union. Today, they represent one of the largest Asian American populations in the Nation. I am proud to note that my State of Illinois is home to over 50,000 Korean Americans, making it the fourth most populated State for Korean Americans, according to the 2000 census data.  The contributions made by Korean Americans to our Nation include numerous achievements in the fields of economics, education, science, architecture, medicine, athletics, religion, and the arts. Their entrepreneurial spirit and dedication to hard work have allowed Korean American-owned businesses to become the commercial and economic foundations in countless American cities and counties. The unique traditional customs, cultures, and the foods of the ``Land of the Morning Calm'' have enhanced the mosaic of our society.  Thousands of Korean Americans have served in our Armed Services, from the two World Wars to the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. They have also served in public and private ways to enhance the long standing relationship between the United States and Korea that is based on our shared economic and security interests.  The 102 pioneers who made that fateful decision to leave their home country in 1902 for Hawaii probably wished for not much more than a chance to live on the rich American soil. Never in their wildest imagination could they have known that, a century later, and just a few miles from where they landed in Honolulu, a sixteen-year-old Korean American girl would announce to an eagerly awaiting world that she would become a professional golfer.  Michelle Wie's announcement from earlier this month instantly places her among the most recognizable American celebrities, and makes her the third highest-paid female athlete in any sport, based on commercial endorsement deals she has accepted. Yet, in her very first act as a professional golfer, Michelle donated $500,000 to the hurricane relief effort. And, she will continue to attend high school where she is an honors student.  Korean Americans have indeed come a long way in their rich one hundred year history. In January 2003, Korean Americans all across the Nation celebrated this centennial anniversary. Leading up to that significant milestone, the United States Senate unanimously adopted a resolution during the 107th Congress.  To continue recognizing this history of Korean Americans, I believe it is appropriate to celebrate the 13th day of each January as ``Korean American Day.'' The Allen-Durbin resolution would encourage such a tradition.  I ask my colleagues to support this resolution honoring the continuing contributions of Korean Americans to our great Nation.                          ____________________
