 I am hopeful that we could come to an agreement that is longer term so we could give more confidence. I think that would be in the best interest and, very frankly, I think would enjoy bipartisan significant support in this House, Mr. Majority Leader.  Lastly, the National Defense Act, authorization bill, which has passed this House, as you know, is pending in the Senate. Does the gentleman have any knowledge as to where that stands now and what possibilities there are to assure its adoption prior to the 11th of December?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding. The gentleman is correct. We have passed it in the House and we have been working with the Senate. I think it is verystrong that we will get this done before December 11. I don't have a set date, but I believe that this is a top priority, not just on this side, but on your side of the aisle as well. We just need a little movement on the Senate and we will be done with it.
