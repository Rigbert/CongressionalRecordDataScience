 President, the Senate is now nearing completion of the bipartisan Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. This is a bipartisan bill which is based on an important principle: that the American people, through the Congress they elect, deserve a say on one of the most important issues of our time.  This act would require that any agreement reached with Iran be submitted to Congress for a review. It would require that Congress be given time to hold hearings and to take a vote to approve or disapprove of the agreement before congressional sanctions could be lifted. It would give Congress more power to rapidly impose sanctions if Iran does cheat.  Many wish the bill were stronger. I don't disagree with them. But this is a piece of legislation worthy of our support. It offers the best chance we have to provide the American people and the Congress they elect with the power to weigh in on a vital issue. We will pursue other opportunities to address Iran's full-spectrum campaign to increase its sphere of influence in the broader Middle East as well.  I look forward to Senators of both parties coming together to pass this bipartisan Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act soon. Once we do, the Senate will take up another measure designed to hold the administration accountable: the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act. This bipartisan bill is about a lot more than just expanding Congress's oversight authority. It is about delivering prosperity for the middle class and supporting jobs. It is about helping American workers sell more of what they make and farmers sell more of what they grow. It is about eliminating unfair rules in other countries that discriminate against American workers and American jobs. Remember, the United States already has one of the most open markets in the world, but other countries maintain unfair barriers against American goods and services--barriers that trade agreements can reduce or even eliminate to make things fairer for America.  That is why the United States is currently involved in negotiations with Europe and several nations in the Pacific such as Japan--in order to break down barriers to goods stamped ``Made in America.'' That is the main point here. We want to knock down barriers to our goods stamped with ``Made in America'' to be sold in other countries.  One estimate shows that trade agreements with Europe and the Pacific could support as many as 1.4 million additional jobs in our country, including over 18,000 in Kentucky alone. But in order to get there, we will first need to lay down some clear and fair rules of the road for our trade negotiators. That is what the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act would do.  First, it would make Congress's priorities clear, issuing specific objectives for the administration's trade negotiators.  Second, it would mandate transparency, forcing the administration to consult regularly with Congress and stakeholders.  And it would reaffirm the supremacy of this body and require our exclusive approval before trade agreements are enacted.  The Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act is good bipartisan legislation that was endorsed overwhelmingly in the Finance Committee 20 to 6. It is good for the middle class, it is good for manufacturers, and, yes, it is very good for farmers.  Here is what one Kentucky constituent--a corn, wheat, and soybean farmer from Spencer County--recently wrote to say on the issue:       We need free trade to compete with grain farms in South      America. Dozens of people have jobs as a direct result of our      small business: Input suppliers, truckers, mechanics and      traders, just to name a few.  He went on.       Help me and all these people by expanding trade and      consumption globally. Our future depends on it.  Well, I couldn't agree more with that farmer from Spencer County. Our future does depend on cultivating better opportunities for American goods, American crops, and American workers in the 21st century.  I look forward to the Senate turning to the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act very soon.                          ____________________
