 President, as anyone familiar with substance abuse treatment knows, recovery from addiction is a one-day-at-a-time procedure--often recovering addicts literally struggle on a daily basis to resist the temptation to use drugs. In recognition of this daily struggle, many treatment and 12-step programs run daily group meetings for those in treatment to gain support and help from others who are also committed to staying sober.  Unfortunately, as has become all too clear in all areas of drug policy, the people who traffic in drugs are unscrupulously cunning in constantly finding new ways to increase the number of people buying and becoming addicted to drugs. One of the easiest targets for drug dealers looking to increase their number of customers are the people most vulnerable to the temptations of drugs--recovering addicts.  Because those in treatment are often so easily tempted and because once they purchase drugs they are likely to become regular customers as their addiction retakes hold full force, they are, perversely, the most sought-after clients for drug dealers, representing a steady and high-consumption consumer base.  It is obviously a problem every time a drug dealer sells narcotics to anyone. It is an even greater problem when drug dealers try to increase their profits by targeting the most susceptible and weakest members of our society. Recognizing this, Congress created drug-free school zones which recognized that drug dealers were finding schools a good place to target potential new customers--susceptible children--where they were most likely to be and where there are a lot of them together. Drug traffickers caught selling drugs in these areas are subject to harsher penalties than for selling outside of these areas.  This step to protect our children has obviously not completely solved the problem of youth drug abuse, but it has increased the chances that children can avoid being pressured by drug dealers into trying drugs. The same type of protection needs to be given to those similarly susceptible to coercion by drug dealers--recovering addicts. This type of tactic is a common occurrence, and it undermines the entire treatment community's efforts.  In addition, many recovering addicts are targeted in the very places they should be most safe: their recovery meetings. It is unfortunately easy for a dealer to attend a meeting such as Narcotics Anonymous, listen to the other attendees, discover who is most vulnerable to a relapse, and approach those people after the meeting in order to expand their client base.  The people targeted are obviously in the unfortunate position of the dealer having heard them in the meeting discussing how tempted they are, what they are craving, and why. It is then very easy for the drug dealer to pretend to be a fellow recovering addict concerned about the addict's struggle and willing to stay after the meeting to talk further--with the intention of getting the person alone and then offering drugs, often free of charge, in the hopes that the unsuspecting addict is drawn into the drug abusing lifestyle once again, thereby becoming a regular paying customer.  In an even more simple scheme, drug dealers often track down former customers after they have entered a treatment program. The drug dealer then becomes a constant presence in the recovering person's life--calling them, coincidentally running into them on the street, and showing up places they know the addict will be. These dealers know it is only a matter of time before the recovering addict has a weak or particularly difficult day, and the dealer wants to be sure the addict's temptation leads to a return to regular drug abuse.  For these reasons, I am now introducing a bill to send a strong message to drug dealers and to severely punish those who don't heed the warning: ``stay away from recovering addicts who are trying to put their lives back together.''  My bill directs the Sentencing Commission to increase penalties for drug distributors who intentionally target recovering addicts. This will send the clear signal to drug dealers to stay away from treatment meetings, former customers who are now in treatment, and anyone else they know is committed to kicking their addiction.  It also sends the right message to those drug addicts who are trying to regain their lives--that society is behind them; that we recognize their admirable struggle; that we are willing and able to help them resist the temptation to return to drug abuse; that we want them to succeed in staying drug free; and that we will punish those who knowingly try to make them fail.  This is a simple yet vital piece of legislation in our fight against drugs, and I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2050       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Recovering Addict Protection      Act of 1996''.     SEC. 2.
