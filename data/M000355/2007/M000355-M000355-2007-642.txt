 Let me say to my friend, the majority leader, I think we have gotten off to a good start this year. We are close to accomplishing two important pieces of legislation with overwhelming bipartisan support. We look forward to moving ahead with a rather contentious debate next week but a debate we obviously ought to have. It is the most important issue in the country with a lot of passionate feelings on both sides of the issue, andwe will have a grand debate in the tradition of the United States Senate next week.                          ____________________
