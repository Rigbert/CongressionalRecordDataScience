Speaker, it is with great respect and admiration that I take this time to recognize Colonel Robert A. Clifford, a fellow Gary, Indiana native, who has been selected for induction into the Indiana Military Veterans Hall of Fame, Class of 2018. Robert's remarkable military career and his outstanding service to our country is truly admirable and worthy of the highest praise. Colonel Clifford will be honored at an induction ceremony taking place on Friday, November 9,2018, at the National Guard Armory in Indianapolis.  Robert Clifford was born and raised in Gary, Indiana. His military training began at Pennsylvania Military College. With each passing year, the Colonel proved himself to be a leader among his peers, which resulted in him being commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the United States Army. Colonel Clifford's career was both outstanding and extensive, and throughout his time in the service, he was recognized by his commanding officers. In 1967, Robert was ordered to Vietnam as Infantry Platoon Leader, 1st Brigade of the 101st Airborne Division. During his time in Vietnam, he spent 324 consecutive days in combat operations. For his service, he was awarded the Silver Star, two Bronze Stars, and the Combat Infantryman's Badge.  The Colonel worked in the Indiana National Guard armory as a traditional weekend soldier before he returned to active status to work with the Indiana National Guard. Entrusted with many responsibilities, he served in many capacities including Commander, 13th Engineer Battalion; Commander, 138th Signal Battalion; Commander of the State Maintenance Program; and 38th Infantry Division General Staff (G3) Training and Operations Officer, a role in which he was responsible for approximately 12,500 soldiers. During his career, Robert was assigned as the Indiana National Guard Engineer and Environmental Officer, overseeing all National Guard facilities for maintenance and repair. In addition, Colonel Clifford was able to help build five new armories, two maintenance shops, the first ammunition supply center, and numerous support facilities. At one point in his career, he was one of three officers assigned by the Pentagon to start a military to military relationship with the newly created country of Slovakia. The successful partnership of these two groups is now in its 24th year. Colonel Clifford also served as the State of Indiana Public Health and Preparedness Director and was tasked with creating a comprehensive plan, involving all necessary state organizations, to provide an immediate response to weapons of mass destruction. This plan was not only implemented; it was made an example of by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a strategy that states should incorporate.  Throughout the years, Colonel Clifford was bestowed numerous awards for his service. He has received the prestigious Legion of Merit Award for his truly exceptional efforts and devotion to the Indiana National Guard. He was awarded the prestigious Sagamore of the Wabash and was named ``A Hoosier Hero.'' In addition, the Colonel was designated a Distinguished Member of the Second Battalion of the 502nd Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division. He was among the first five ever to receive this honor from his Battalion.  Robert Clifford's commitment to his career is exceeded only by his devotion to his amazing family. Robert and his wonderful wife, Karen, have been married for 48 years. They have two sons, Rob (Jill) and Scott (Heather), and four beloved grandchildren.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring Robert Clifford for his lifetime of service to the United States military and to the State of Indiana. For his truly noteworthy career and his outstanding dedication to serving others, Colonel Robert Clifford is worthy of the honors bestowed upon him, and we are grateful for all of his many contributions.                          ____________________
