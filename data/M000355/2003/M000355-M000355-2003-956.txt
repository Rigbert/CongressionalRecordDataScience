 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today it stand in adjournment until 9:30 a.m., Tuesday, May 6. I further ask that following the prayer and the pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired and the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then begin a period for morning business until 10:30 a.m., with the time equally divided between the two leaders or their designees and with Members permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each; provided that at 10:30 a.m., the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. 14, the energy bill, as provided under the previous order.  I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate recess from 12:30 to 2:15 for the weekly party lunches.
