 Speaker, today I recognize the outstanding work done by participants in my Student Congressional Town Meeting held this summer. These participants were part of a group of high school students from around Vermont who testified about the concerns they have as teenagers, and about what they would like to see the government do regarding these concerns.  I am asking that these statements be submitted into the Congressional Record, as I believe that the views of these young persons will benefit my colleagues.          Hon. BERNARD SANDERS in the House of Representatives                     on behalf of SCOTT DOBROWOLSKI                  Regarding GUN CONTROL--May 26, 2000       SCOTT DOBROWOLSKI: I come here this morning to speak on gun      control, and as our schools have been noted, there is more      and more shootings in our schools. Now legislation has been      taking away handguns, assault rifles, many of the weapons      that have been used to kill our students.       Now as I see it, I have been raised with firearms in my      home and as part of this I have had a lot of training with      them. I have been told right and wrong, whether or not to      shoot, what to shoot. I deer hunt. Really a matter of my      training as I have been told not to kill people.       As we have learned there is more and more students killing      each other. A lot of these children have been decided and      acquitted for not knowing the difference between killing      their student and just merely playing around.       As I see it, there should be more education in school as to      avoid the shooting of their classmates. If we started at a      younger age, I believe that we could severely delay the risk      of having all these shootings. I am not saying hand-on      experience with firearms, but more or less just education on      right and wrong in our schools because apparently as we have      seen, parents no longer care or they are not doing their job.       My parents at a very young age taught me the difference      between right and wrong and responsibility and I feel this is      not being done anymore. Frankly, I went to France and instead      of fearing the fact that my plane would go down I have a      greater percentage of dying in my school because one of my      friends might get ticked off because I told him he looked      funny and he might shoot at me. I feel this is a great danger      and should be stopped at a more recent time where children      are more able to be influenced by what happens in their      lives.                                  ____                                            Hon. BERNARD SANDERS in the House of Representatives                      on behalf of NATHAN LOIZEAUX               Regarding COLLEGE FINANCING--May 26, 2000       NATHAN LOIZEAUX: Thank you very much. I would like to talk      to you about college financing. I am a Mt. Abraham senior     right now. I will graduate this year, and I have been trying      to get together finances to go to college and I am just      realizing how hard it is. Yes, there are a lot of      scholarships out there today. I have actually a book about      this thick.       Unfortunately, once you start whittling down parents,      grandparents, what activities you are involved in, your      heritage, all of a sudden you find out the white male does      not have to many scholarships out there, and then not only to      top that off, but he has got to compete with everybody else      in the state for the exact same scholarships.       Also my parents and great grandparents started a college      account for me. They started saving up money for me. My      parents were severely penalized for having a college savings      account. I think that is totally wrong. You and people in      Congress, people in government want teenagers and high school      students to be able to go on to college to get a better      education, and in this day and age you need a better      education to get a good job. Yes, there are thousands of jobs      out there for $6 an hour.       Unfortunately, you are never going to make it out of that      gene pool without a college education. Unfortunately, a      college education is very expensive. Take UVM here, for      instance. I work here as a temporary helper in the summer.      This college just recently raised its tuition. Colleges all      over the state are raising their tuition. It is harder and      harder to get into a college. You want us to get a better      education but are denying us the ability to do that by not      giving us the funds. And when colleges are constantly      bringing up their tuition to get in, it makes it all that      much harder. When parents are being penalized for having the      accounts for the children to set aside money to go to the      college it is even worse.       In this day and age if you are on welfare you're better      off. You can get into a college, no problem on welfare      basically at this point because they will pay for everything      to go to college. A friend of mine is on welfare right now      and she got accepted to the university here, UVM, and she      basically does not have to pay a thing while she is here the      entire time. She has lower grades than I do, she is not      involved in the community nearly as much as I am. I applied      for the same place here, but I cannot get in even though I      have better academic grades and I am involved in more things.      That does not really matter to me, I do not care about their      selection process. It is the fact that people like me are      getting denied money for setting aside money for this time      and because just the raising of funds to get into a college      and the expenses. We need to get a better education but in      order to do it we need to have the funds. The problem is we      do not have the funds.                                  ____                                            Hon. BERNARD SANDERS in the House of Representativeson behalf of KATHY UNGER, MEREDITH BLESS, CULLEN BOUVIER and SCOTT WARD                  Regarding CIVIL UNIONS--May 26, 2000       KATIE UNGER: I am going to begin. Okay. We are here to      support the Civil Union Law that Vermont passed recently, but      we are of the opinion that it should have gone further, and      we think that--basically we think that everyone should have a      right to be joined in marriage. And when you define marriage      it is sort of a celebration of life and of loving another      person and it is just something that everyone should be able      to do whether or not their partner is male or female.       MEREDITH BLESS: We also think that it should be forced on      the church to marry two people. It should be separate from      the church because it is kind of against the church for that.      But somebody who could do it like a justice of the peace.       SCOTT WARD: As Katie said, we commend Vermont for taking      the steps that it has, but we feel that it is more of a      national issue and that other states need to be involved in      this also. So we really feel it does need to be taken further      and not just Vermont.       CULLEN BOUVIER: I take the standpoint of Scott as well. I      think that Vermont is doing a great job taking the first      steps in the Civil Union Bill and doing great things for      people, but you see different things in the papers about--     last week I can recall a man putting out a sign by his      driveway that was not very kind words toward homosexual      people, and you just realize that there is a lot more that      can be done.                                  ____                                            Hon. BERNARD SANDERS in the House of Representatives              on behalf of THALIA SPARLING and KATE EARLEY                 Regarding BIOENGINEERING--May 26, 2000       THALIA SPARLING: I wanted to raise the issue of genetically      modified food which the FDA has refused to label on products.      Genetically modified food has been on the market for six      years now and there is very little awareness from the common      people, the public about this issue. And there is a really      strong grass roots movement in Vermont right now over this      issue, and it is an issue that really needs to be addressed.       KATE EARLEY: I feel that we do not know enough about this      issue that they should not be able to label it, because      basically they are just feeding us things we do not know      thinking about. And if they have to say how much of what is      in certain foods and they have to label food now, they should      not be able to not label this, because it does not give a      person a choice of what they are putting in their body. And      they do not know enough of what could happen 20 years from      now from doing this or 30 years from now or generations from      now how it could effect us physically or in the environment      or anything. We need to do a lot more testing before they can      be allowed to put this in the food, or label it, at least      label it.                               ____________________
