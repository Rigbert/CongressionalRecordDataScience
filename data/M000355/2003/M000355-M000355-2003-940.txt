 President, I ask unanimous consent that, at a time determined by the majority leader, after consultation with the Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to the consideration of calendar No. 53, the bioshield bill. I further ask consent that the only amendments, other than the committee amendment, be the following: a Gregg-Kennedy substitute, and a Byrd amendment regarding mandatory spending. I further ask consent that there be 2 hours for general debate and 1 hour on each amendment to be equally divided in the usual form. I further ask consent that following the disposition of the above amendments and the use or yielding back of debate time, the bill be read a third time, and the Senate then proceed to a vote on passage of the bill, with no intervening action or debate.
