Chairman, on the point of order. I must point out that the section that the gentleman refers to, I think, rule XXI, clause 5(b), this particular amendment that we are offering, which is not the one that was listed in the Congressional Digest this morning, is a different amendment.  The reason that this does not violate that rule is simply because there is ostensibly no tariff revenue collected on these Chinese goods made under these conditions because the U.S. Customs Department should be complying with the law. In other words, these goods should not be coming over our shores, and, therefore, revenues should not be being collected on them.  So this particular amendment is revenue-neutral, unlike, perhaps, another amendment that was being contemplated which might have been proper to raise a point of order against yesterday. This is a different amendment. Therefore, it does not have any revenue impact. It does not violate any jurisdiction of any other committee in this Chamber. It merely asks the Customs Service to enforce the laws that we have placed on them, but it does not have any revenue impact.
