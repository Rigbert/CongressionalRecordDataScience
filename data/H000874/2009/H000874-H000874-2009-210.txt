Obviously scoring will be the litmus test by which we determine whether it is paid for. When Mr. Elmendorf made the statement before the Budget Committee in the Senate, he was speaking more of the bending of the curve, which is going to be longer term than whether or not we determine whether the bill is paid for. But in my view, we need to do both. Of course the bill he was talking about was the Senate bill. The House bill has not yet been fully scored. But if, in fact, that score shows that it is not fully paid for, what I meant by ``going back to the drawing board,'' we will then have to assess how we can get the bill to a place where it is scored as a fully-paid-for bill, consistent with PAYGO. That's our pledge. That's my intent, that's the Speaker's intent, and we will work towards that objective.
