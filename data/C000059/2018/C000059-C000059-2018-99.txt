Chairman, I thank the gentleman because this is somewhat personal to me. I appreciate the gentleman's interest in this illegal marijuana cultivation in our national forests.  One of the largest national forests in the State of California, Cleveland National Forest, is literally in my congressional district and right close to my house. We are always having problems with people setting up illegal grow operations in the Cleveland National Forest. So this increase to remediate these sites is needed.  I agree with the gentlewoman that these offsets are difficult, but I am pleased to offer my support for the gentleman's amendment. Hopefully, we can get rid of some of this illegal marijuana that is grown in these national forests.  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chairman, may I ask how much time I have left.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 2 minutes remaining.  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chairman, again, I appreciate the conversation here, but when you look at the depth and the danger of what is being brought into our States and my own part of northern California, my colleague in the Cleveland National Forest, this is an acute problem. The environmental damage is unspeakable with the amount of chemicals, the damage to the wildlife, and the threat this poses to people out there innocently hiking camping, utilizing the forest or maybe for even logging operations.  So we need to kick-start this as strongly as possible, and that is why I offer this amendment tonight in order to counter and send a message that we are taking this seriously where Federal employees, Federal agents have feared to tread in recent years because of this tremendous threat that the Mexican nationals and gang activity has caused in our national forests that belong to the people.  So, again, I urge my colleagues to support this. It is an important start and weaves into so much with human trafficking, environmental destruction, and even, in some cases, murder associated with the problems of the growth of this product in our national forests.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).  The amendment was agreed to.                 Amendment No. 35 Offered by Mr. Welch  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 35 printed in House Report 115-830.
