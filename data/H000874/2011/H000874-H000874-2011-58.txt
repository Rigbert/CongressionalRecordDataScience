He talks about voting for budgets.  I didn't agree with some of the priorities in your budget; that's accurate. He is correct that we didn't cut taxes, but he is incorrect as to when you cut taxes. You cut taxes in April, months before 9/11, and you gave away a lot of money and you didn't pay for it. You didn't cut spending in order to pay for it in your budgets that you offered. Furthermore, what the gentleman doesn't point out is in 1993, to a person, you voted against a program which was designed to pay our bills--to a person. You said it would destroy the economy.  We had the best economy and the largest budget surplus that you've had and an administration that is the only administration in your lifetime that ended its 96 months with a surplus, Bill Clinton's.
