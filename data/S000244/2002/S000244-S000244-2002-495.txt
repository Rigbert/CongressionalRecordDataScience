Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Chairman, there has been an awful lot of hyperbole that is floating around this Chamber from those who are opposed to this legislation.  First of all, the legislation does not diminish any cause of action that anybody may have, either as an individual or member of a class. So if they have a cause of action and the right to sue now, if this bill becomes law, they will still have that cause of action and that right to sue. So what is the beef?  What this bill does do is it provides fairness. I think the biggest example of how unfair the State court system can be involves the Mississippi case that has been referred to several times previously, where the hometown judge in Mississippi approved a class action settlement that gave Mississippi residentsas much as 18 times more than residents of other States. That is what the Federal court diversity citizenship jurisdiction that was put into the Constitution was designed to prevent.  This bill changes the way diversity is defined so that the abuses that the Framers were concerned about in 1787 can be prevented in class action lawsuits that they never thought would ever arise in this country. So that is what we are dealing with here.  What we are dealing with here also is a better way of having the courts review the fairness of noncash settlements. We have heard an awful lot about the coupons, where people end up having to buy the same product of the company that injured them, or the same service of the company that injured them.  It seems to me that if somebody injured me enough to go to court and file a lawsuit and try it, if I won my lawsuit, I ought not to be forced to go back to the same company that caused the problem to begin with. This bill provides for increased scrutiny to protect consumers against that.  Mr. Chairman, I think that the hyperbole we are hearing from the people who are opposed to this bill really is designed to try to get the attention of this body and the American public away from what is in the bill.                              {time}  1330  All I would ask while we continue debating this bill and the amendments is for the opponents to read the bill, because most of the complaints that they have are really not present in this legislation.
