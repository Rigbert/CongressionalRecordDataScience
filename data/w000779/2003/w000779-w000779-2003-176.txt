 Again, the Senator from Idaho has been critical of the Congressional Budget Office report, saying that perhaps they did not look forward; they just looked backward. I would urge my colleagues to look at the report because the report does, in fact, look to 2011 and the future, and that is what the Congressional Budget Office did make their judgment on, where they said there was a risk of default that was well over 50 percent.  But my question to my colleague is whether my colleague thinks it is relevant about who assumes risk with respect to energy production. Because he is absolutely right, there are no foolproof guarantees in life. There is no question there is risk. Here, however, I see the taxpayer being at risk. The taxpayer is on the hook for $16 billion.  I thought it was interesting that the distinguished chairman of the committee talked about the credits for production.  Well, the fact is, when you get a credit for production, the producer is largely at risk because in order to get the break, you have to produce something. There is no tax credit, I say to my colleagues, for failing to produce a successful wind venture. You get the credit if your wind venture is successful.  My understanding is that here, with the subsidy, the person who assumes the risk is the taxpayer, not the producer. I was wondering if the distinguished Senator from Idaho thinks it is relevant with respect to who takes the risk. This Senator does because the taxpayer is on the hook rather than those who produce. I am curious of the reaction of the distinguished Senator from Idaho.
