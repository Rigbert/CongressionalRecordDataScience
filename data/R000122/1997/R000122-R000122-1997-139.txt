President, no one objects to Pell grants. This should be a vote about expanding the Pell grants so we can change the reality that faces working families in this country.  In 1975, 80 percent of Federal financial assistance was in the form of grants and 20 percent in loans. Today, those numbers are reversed. I believe we should expand the Pell grants along the lines of the Wellstone-Reed amendment.  I hope we can do that sometime.
