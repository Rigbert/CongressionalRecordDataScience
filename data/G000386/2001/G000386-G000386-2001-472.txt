  Tonight, the Senate will pass S. 143, the Competitive Market Supervision Act of 2001. This bill, which has been approved by the Banking Committee, reduces the schedule of Securities and Exchange Commission fees in a manner that properly conforms the structure of these fees to conventional user fees. If enacted, this bill ensures that these fees will be conventional user fees, not taxes, not generate general revenue, and therefore matters within the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee.
