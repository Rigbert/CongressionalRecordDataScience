 We are going to have to call some Members back. They already left on the representation that this was the last vote of the day. I would imagine you have some Members that are in that category themselves.  Can the gentleman give me any idea of when we will have notice as to whether or not there will be further votes today?  Mr. McCARTHY of California. Knowing that some Members, with this vote just now closed, and earlier they announced that we would not walk off the floor until 3:45, I think it is possible to advise all Members that it is possible to have votes later today.  I am hopeful that by late this afternoon we will be able to notify the time of it.                          ____________________
