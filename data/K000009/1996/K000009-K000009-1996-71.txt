Speaker, I looked at my dictionary, Webster's dictionary, before I came down here this evening and saw that it defines anarchy as the absence of government; a state of political disorder.  Well, folks, that is where we are tonight, and I was reminded of that even more when someone from the other body, from Texas, who aspires to the highest office in this land, appeared on the David Brinkley show last Sunday. For those of my colleagues who may have missed it, that individual taunted the audience with this question about the Government shutdown. He said, ``Have you missed the Government? I mean, doesn't it strike you as funny that 280,000 Government employees are furloughed and large segments of the Government of the United States are shut down?''  Well, let me give that fellow from Texas a heavy dose of reality.                              {time}  1900  I hate to burst his bubble, but I have a list here of residents of the Ninth Congressional District of Ohio who would respectfully beg to differ with him. As a matter of fact, no, it does not strike them as funny that much of our Government is shut down.  For example, Jan, a student from Toledo, was supposed to start school this week, but now will not be able to because of this budget impasse. Jan called me and said, and I quote her directly, ``My financial aid papers can't be processed until the Department of Education gets up and running, and I can't start school without having the paperwork processed.'' She said there are ``millions of students like me.'' Well, she does not think it is very funny.  Two disabled veterans from our community, Gary and Tom, called our office to say that they were very upset that their compensation checks are late. They asked me, ``How are we supposed to pay our bills?'' They represent millions of disabled veterans.  Another veteran in my district, Charles, of Oregon, OH, is 76 years old and receives railroad retirement, which he earned. He asked me, ``How come they cut my check by $124?'' The veterans of my district, and all veterans all over our Nation, know what some elected officials clearly do not know. They do not get it. They do not know that in response to this shutdown, railroad retirement reduced its benefit payments by 64 percent; that the December 22 continuing resolution which provided continuing funding for certain veterans benefits and payments expires today; that contractors providing services and supplies to hospitals will not be paid and benefits for January will not be paid on February 1.  Approximately 170,000 veterans did not receive their December Montgomery GI bill education benefits and will not receive benefits this month.  These are the same men and women who have served our country in times of crisis, the soldiers and families who have given above and beyond the call of duty in defense of this Nation, yet some would dishonor their honorable service by saying it is funny that we are leaving them high and dry.  Deborah, of Waterville, OH, called my office to say that she and her family departed last week for a long-awaited holiday hiking vacation at the Grand Canyon, but the canyon was closed due to the shutdown. She said, ``Please find a way to end this political nonsense now. These tactics affect the American citizens and many hard-working Government employees that now have no means to generate income for their families.''  She is right. On an average day, 383,000 people visit our National Parks System. Losses for businesses in those communities adjacent to our national parks could reach $14 million a day due to reduced tourism. It is not funny to those people. They understand what governance is all about.  Loryn, of Toledo, called my office to say that she was supposed to begin to study in Spain and was scheduled to leave January 5, but will not be able to because she cannot get her passport back from the passport office. She has lost $1,000 already in nonrefundable airfare and may lose the $5,000 paid for this semester of schooling.  She is not alone. On an average day the State Department receives over 23,000 applications for passports and 20,000 visas for visitors to this country. To those citizens and to those visitors it is not funny at all.  Jan, of Toledo, called my office to say that her son and daughter are serving in the Peace Corps in the Ukraine, and guess what. Their stipends for service were cut off. It is not funny to them.  Let us bring up the Dole bill, pass it, and put America on the right track again, and tell the gentleman from the other body that his irresponsible comments border on anarchy.                          ____________________
