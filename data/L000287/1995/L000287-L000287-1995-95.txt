I thank my friend and colleague, the gentleman from West Virginia [Mr. Wise], for yielding time to me.  There have been two gentleman on the other side who have referred to what I said yesterday and I wanted to say exactly what I said yesterday, Mr. Speaker.  I said yesterday and I say again today, I am reminded of a quote by the great theologian, Martin Niemoller, during World War II:       In Germany, they first came for the Communists, and I      didn't speak up because I wasn't a Communist. Then they came      for the Jews, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Jew.      Then they came for the trade unionists, and I didn't speak up      because I wasn't a trade unionist. Then they came for the      Catholics, and I didn't speak up because I was a Protestant.      Then they came for me, and by that time there was no one left      to speak up.  I said yesterday, Mr. Speaker, this Republican proposal certainly is not [[Page H3433]] the Holocaust, but I am concerned and I must speak up.  I urge my colleagues, open your eyes, read the proposal, read the small print, read the Republican contract.  And I went on to say yesterday, they are coming for the children. They are coming for the poor. They are coming for the sick, the elderly, and the disabled. This is the Contract With America.  I said to my colleagues, you have the ability, the capacity, the power to stop this onslaught. Your voice is your vote. Vote against this mean-spirited proposal. Raise your voice for the children, the poor, and the disabled.  I say it again today, Mr. Speaker, for the Record.
