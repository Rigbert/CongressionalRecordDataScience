President, special thanks to my colleague and friend, Senator Gordon Smith, who represents the State of Oregon and our Nation with grace and civility, intelligence and accomplishment, for this special order paying tribute to our Kansas Senator Bob Dole.  It doesn't seem possible that it has been 10 years since Bob's tenure as our majority leader ended, a tenure that represents the longest serving Senate leader of our Republican Party since the founding of the Grand Old Party in1854. During those 12 years of leadership, there were difficult and challenging times. But Bob Dole's legacy was and is legislative accomplishment, always in Bob Dole style, a unique mixture of principle and compromise when necessary, comity, his great gift of wit and humor and good old Kansas common sense.  In 1968, when Bob first ran for the Senate, his theme song was ``Let a Leader Lead the Way.'' He certainly did. It would be impossible to list all of Bob's legislative achievements, but the Dole Institute at the University of Kansas does provide some highlights. I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.
