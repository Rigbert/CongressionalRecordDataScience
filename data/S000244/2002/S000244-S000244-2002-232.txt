Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), the majority whip.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding me this time.  I just want to answer the last speaker. That kind of attitude that thinks that when a judge speaks that that is the law of the land, well, it does not work that way by the Constitution. There are checks and balances in our Constitution, and what Congress does is relevant to what the judiciary does.  Congress is going to stand up in this particular case and fight the judiciary of this country and stop them from running amuck. There is accountability built into the Constitution, as long as this Congress understands that they have a responsibility to defend the Constitution against a runaway judiciary.  It appears that this Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has experienced another short-circuit. This court went way too far, and we know that. This Congress is committed to righting that court's wrongs, starting right here, right now, today.  Now, according to this absurd logic, the following could be in danger of being outlawed:  The four mentions of God in the Declaration of Independence that made our country free; the oath that each President takes to uphold the Constitution, which holds our Nation together; the words etched right here above the Speaker in this august institution that helps govern our Nation; the phrase that begins with each U.S. Supreme Court session, ``God Save the United States;'' the oath of witnesses to tell the truth in courts that protect us; our own currency that keeps our Nation prosperous; and the singing of God bless America on the steps of this Capitol that signaled yesterday our resolve.  So as my colleagues can see, this absurd decision was made by a court run amuck; and I urge all our Members, of all political stripes, to send a very clear message and put the stars and stripes, along with the words ``God Bless America'' as the banner for their .gov websites.  As upset as we all are, once again we must summon the best in us to defend this one Nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. This Congress is not going to let anyone strip our Nation of our proud heritage; not now, not ever.                              {time}  1500
