 President, I rise to speak in support of S. 395, title II, which would allow for the first time the export of Alaska North Slope crude oil to foreign markets.  Mr. President, I have struggled long and hard over this bill. Constituents from my State have mixed views on the benefits of exporting ANS crude oil abroad.  After discussing this bill with all affected parties and weighing the pros and cons, I am convinced that this legislation, as now drafted, satisfies the problems that have been identified and, on balance, presents a win-win solution.  Let me briefly go over the concerns I have had, including the possible impacts on jobs, on crude oil supplies for the west coast, and on the environment.                                  jobs  First, for this legislation to be a success, it must not eliminate jobs in one place while adding them somewhere else. That is why I support its requirement that any ANS crude exported abroad must be carried in American-flagged and American-crewed ships. Otherwise, crude oil that now comes to American refineries in American ships would instead be going to overseas refineries in foreign ships.  But I am also concerned that the ships carrying this crude be built in American yards. While I understand why such a requirement cannot be included in this bill, I have received assurances from BP America, the company that is most likely to be exporting the crude overseas, that it is committed to building any new ships needed for this trade in American yards. I received the following letter from BP America on this issue:                                [[Page S6742]] September 30, 1994.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: Further to discussions with you      held September 30, 1994, if the ban on Alaska exports is      lifted, BP will commit now and in the future to use only      U.S.-built, U.S.-flagged, U.S.-crewed ships for such exports.      We will supplement or replace ships required to transport      Alaskan crude oil with U.S.-built ships as existing ships are      phased out under the provisions in the Oil Pollution Act of      1990.       I hope that this commitment satisfies your request that      Alaska oil exports be carried on U.S.-built, U.S.-flag ships,      manned by U.S. crews.           Yours sincerely,                                                  Steven Benz,                                                        President,                                     BP Oil Shipping Company, USA.                              oil supplies  Second, the loss of ANS crude oil supplies from the west coast of the United States must not create a situation where gasoline prices at the pump go up in our western States, or where our western refineries that now depend on this crude oil supply must close their doors because they are unable to replace it at a reasonable cost.  This bill specifies that the President shall determine on an annual basis whether independent refiners in the Western United States are able to secure adequate supplies of crude. If not, he is to make recommendations to Congress. Further, the bill requires that the GAO conduct a broader assessment of the impacts of the export of ANS crude after 5 years, including gasoline prices at the pump, and make any recommendations necessary.                          ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT  Third, I have been concerned that passage of this legislation could increase pressure for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and off the west coast of the United States. The administration has assured me that it will oppose such drilling, and that this is an issue that is totally separate from whether or not ANS crude should be exported.                                BENEFITS  Now, Mr. President, let me turn to the dramatic benefits the export of ANS crude offers. The current law provides that all ANS crude be shipped to American refineries. This creates an artificial surplus in crude oil supplies on the west coast, which depresses the price that refineries are willing to pay for alternative sources of supply, such as the heavy crude oil pumped in Kern County, CA.  Independent oil producers in Kern County have laid off thousands of workers over the past decade, and shut down many wells. Eliminating the federally mandated oil glut on the west coast will raise the price paid for Kern County crude and make its production viable once again. The Department of Energy estimates that this will generate from 5,000 to 15,000 new jobs very quickly, with as many as 10,000 to 25,000 by decade end, most of which will be in Kern County.  As you know, Mr. President, California still has not joined the rest of the United States in a full recovery from the recession of 1990. Unemployment has remained particularly high in California's Central Valley, caused in part by dramatic fluctuations in annual rainfall, but also by the steady decline in employment and production in the Kern County fields.  So, in conclusion, Mr. President, I am pleased to state my support for this legislation, which will provide net positive benefits to our merchant marine, our independent oil producers, and the companies pumping ANS crude, while providing protection through periodic evaluation of its impacts for our shipyards and our independent refiners.
