 President, I am reintroducing a private relief bill on behalf of the Buendias, a family who has lived in the Fresno area of California for more than 20 years. The beneficiaries of this bill include Jose Buendia Balderas, his wife, Alicia Aranda de Buendia, and their daughter, Ana Laura Buendia Aranda. I believe this family merits Congress' special consideration.  I would like to start with the story of Jose Buendia, a remarkable father and husband who has embraced the hard work ethic of this country. Many years ago, Jose's father worked as an agricultural worker on the Bracero program.  In 1981, he brought his son to the United States. Jose worked hard, providing financial support to his family in Mexico and working his way up through jobs in landscaping and construction.  Today, Jose is a valuable employee with Bone Construction, Inc. He has worked with this California-based company for nearly 10 years, developing skills and experience and now serving as a lead foreman. Timothy Bone, the owner of the company, calls Jose a ``reliable, hardworking and conscientious'' worker.  Jose is married to Alicia, who goes to work season after season in California's labor-intensive agriculture industry. She currently works for a fruit packing company in Reedley, California. Jose and Alicia have raised two outstanding children, Ana Laura, age 22, and Alex, age 20, who have both always excelled in school.  Ana Laura earned a 4.0 GPA at Reedley High School, and was offered an academic scholarship at the University of California, Berkeley. Unfortunately, she could not accept the scholarship because of her undocumented status.  Ana Laura nonetheless persisted. She enrolled at the University of California, Irvine and is on track to graduate this spring with a major in Chicano Studies and Art.  Ana Laura's younger brother, Alex, is a United States citizen. He graduated high school with a 3.85 GPA and now studies engineering at the University of California, Merced. Last spring, he graduated with honors and a scholarship from Reedley College with an Associate of Science degree in Engineering.  Remarkably, the Buendias should have been able to correct their immigration status years ago. Jose should have qualified for legalization pursuant to the Immigration and Reform Control Act of 1986; however, his application was never acted upon because his attorney was convicted of fraudulently submitting legalization and Special Agricultural Worker applications, tainting all of his clients.  The Immigration and Naturalization Service took nearly 7 years to determine that Jose's application contained no fraudulent information, but at that point it was too late. Jose was no longer eligible for relief due to changes in U.S. immigration law.  Still, the Buendia family continued to seek legal status through other means. In 1999, it appeared they had succeeded when an Immigration Judge granted the family cancellation of removal based on the hardship their son, Alex, would face if deported to Mexico. However, the decision was appealed and ultimately overturned. At this point, the Buendias have exhausted their options to remain together as a family here in the United States.  In the more than 20 years of living in California, the Buendias have shown that they are committed to working to achieve the American dream. They have a strong connection to their local community, as active members of the Parent Teachers Association and theirchurch. They pay their taxes every year, paid off their mortgage, and remain free of debt. They have shown that they are responsible, maintaining health insurance, savings accounts, and retirement accounts.  Moreover, the Buendia children are excellent students pursuing higher education here in the United States. Without this private bill, these young adults will be separated from their family or forced to relocate to a country they simply do not know. I do not believe it is in the Nation's best interest to prevent talented youth raised here in the United States, who have good moral character and outstanding academic records, from realizing their future.  I respectfully ask my colleagues for their support of the Buendia family. I hope the Senate will consider this private relief legislation in the 112th Congress.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 440       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR JOSE BUENDIA                    BALDERAS, ALICIA ARANDA DE BUENDIA, AND ANA                    LAURA BUENDIA ARANDA.
