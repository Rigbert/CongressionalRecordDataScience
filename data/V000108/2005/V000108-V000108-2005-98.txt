Speaker, it is with great honor and admiration that I offer congratulations to many of Northwest Indiana's most talented, dedicated, and hardworking individuals. On Friday, June 10, 2005, the Plumbers Local Union 210 will honor the completion class of 2005 at the Annual Apprentice Completion Banquet which will be held at the Patio Banquet Hall in Merrillville, Indiana.  They will be recognizing and honoring the 2005 Apprentice Graduates. The individuals who have completed the apprentice training are: Jamie Anderson, Damon Berry, Jesse Brill, Robert Burkus, Raymond Crawford, Michael Fanning, Kenneth Francus, Jason Kennedy, Robin Marshal, Josh Musser, Scott Norwine, Joe Palek, Joshua Poston, Daniel Rosenbaum, Collin Sanders, Brian Schoff, Kevin Stonehill, Lee Thomas, Chris Tomko, and John Zbell.  Northwest Indiana has a rich history of excellence in its craftsmanship and loyalty by its tradesmen. These graduates are all outstanding examples of each. They have mastered their trade and have demonstrated their loyalty to both the union and the community through their hard work and self-sacrifice.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating these hardworking individuals. Along with all the other men and women of Northwest Indiana's unions, these individuals have contributed to the growth and development to the economy of the First Congressional District, and I am very proud to honor them in Washington, D.C.                          ____________________
