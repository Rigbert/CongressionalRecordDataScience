FRIST. Mr. President, through the Chair, we are currently still negotiating and working on the omnibus, and we will continue to work for the next probably 6 to 7 hours. So I will not be able to comment definitively until probably first thing in the morning. Again, we continue to work. Initially, we hoped to make progress even tonight on the omnibus, but we were unable to do that. So we will not be adjourning right afterwards. We will likely be in through tomorrow and would like to get as far as we can with the omnibus at that time.
