Mr. Speaker, I come from a State which has more of its land locked up in wilderness than any other State, 58 million acres. This is larger than the entire State of New York and accounts for 56 percent of all the wilderness in the United States, so I think I know wilderness. I know that a lot of wilderness in Alaska is designated for reasons that have little to do with the stated goals of the Wilderness Act.  The designations have blocked vital uses of these lands and blocked access to State and private resources that we Alaskans were promised when we entered statehood. There have been and still are major consequences for what Congress did in 1980. In the East, where most of you come from, that is not always the case.  All I can say is that if this is what Mr. Boucher and his constituents want in Virginia, then good luck. I can guess that one day, I think that one day they will regret this action. Given Virginia's population growth, the severe risk of forest fires, such as they are in California today, caused by sustained drought, I believe all but two counties have been declared disaster areas by the Governor last week, problems with gypsy moths and other agricultural threats to this area and the dampening effect that wilderness restrictions can have on the development of adjacent areas, you may wonder why you have brought this upon yourself. We should be looking to give the Forest Service more tools to manage our lands, not taking them away, which is exactly what wilderness does.  Once this bill becomes law, our constituents, your constituents, may find that they may not be able to burn wood in their fireplaces that keep them warm in the winter because their quality of wilderness must be protected, or that a new school or hospital can't be built because the view shed for the wilderness could be affected. People are even talking about ``smellscapes'' when it comes to wilderness areas, so enjoy your Weber grill right now while you can.  The committee should also know that H.R. 1011 designates nearly 27,000 acres of wilderness above what was recommended by the Forest Service. This is contrary to the recently revised Jefferson National Forest Plan, which took 11 years, millions of dollars, and extensive public involvement to create. We asked for this study. They followed the rules, but now we are ignoring the professional land managers.  In addition, H.R. 1011 will endanger citizens living near this proposed wilderness area by tying the hands of the Forest Service, who need to perform proactive treatments that could reduce the risk of wildfires. Wildfires, I keep stressing that because we are seeing what is happening in California. If they cleared off those forests around those homes, they would not be burning today, but that was prohibited.  Nonqualifying areas are now being actively managed for endangered threatened species protection, and this could come to an end.  The amendment filed by Mr. Goodlatte helps mitigate some of these issues, and I will strongly support the amendment. Most notably, the amendment will remove 26 acres which contain a power line and remove 1,263 acres from the proposed designation to allow continued use of the Barton Gap Motorized trail and Wildlife Habitat Management in key areas.  I could go on and on about this. I just want to warn people, it is not the area we are talking about; it is the Wilderness Act itself, and it should be upgraded. I encourage my chairman to do so so that we can address those problems that can occur from the designation of wilderness, taking care of gypsy moths, taking care of the fires, taking care of the ability to access and to have the availability of the area for public use. If we do not do that, then I think we are doing ourselves a great mistake.  I do not live in this area. I am not affected by it. That's why, very frankly, I am not raising some of the objections that I should have raised to it.  I think you will learn, though, in the long run, you are not doing yourselves a favor. The Forest Service themselves can manage this land in a manner that will take and provide for the people. Itdoes not have to be designated as a wilderness area.  Again, it has already been done. We have moved it out of committee, and I will say, again, may I not be on this floor when you come back to say we have to revise it.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1715
