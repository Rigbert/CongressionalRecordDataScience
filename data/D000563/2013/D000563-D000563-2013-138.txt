President, I would like to take a moment to thank Carmen Velasquez of Chicago, who is retiring as executive director of Alivio Medical Center, for her many years of service to the Latino Community and the city of Chicago.  As a community leader, civil rights activist, health and education advocate, and one of my personal ``she-ros,'' Carmen Velasquez has dedicated her life to justice and equitable health access for all. As one of the original founders of the Alivio Medical Center, she has served the community for 25 years, helping grow one community health center to a network of 6 clinics, with plans to open two new sites this year.  Carmen is the daughter of Mexican immigrants--her father harvested beets in South Dakota before coming to Illinois to start a successful jukebox business. Carmen went on to earn degrees from Loyola University Chicago and the University of the Americas in Puebla, Mexico.  In her professional career, Carmen dedicated her talents and energy to universal health care and immigration reform as a community organizer. She was a social worker and bilingual education specialist, who quickly became a pillar of Chicago's Latino community.  As a member of Chicago's Board of Education, she realized that more needed to be done not only to address the needs of the Latino community in schools, but also in health clinics.  In 1988, Carmen's mission was clear; she needed to find a place to address the too often neglected medical needs of her community. While walking through Chicago's Pilsen neighborhood in search of clinic space, Carmen came upon a muffler shop parking lot littered with rusting old trucks. She went inside the shop and asked its owner if the lot was for sale.  His response? ``Offer me something.''  Carmen Velasquez made an offer, and with that, she began her active campaign to raise $2.1 million for construction of the first of Alivio's community health centers.  Carmen's passion and tenacity turned her dream into a reality. Alivio Medical Center opened its doors 1 year later in 1989, as a bilingual, bicultural nonprofit community health center. Alivio has since grown to become a respected advocacy organization that is also an essential safety net provider for many low-income and vulnerable residents of Chicago.  Because of Carmen Velasquez's hard work and dedication, Alivio continues to meet the primary health care needs of over 20,000 Spanish-speaking, predominantly Mexican immigrants who fall through the cracks of the health care system every year. The residents of the Pilsen, Little Village and Back of the Yards neighborhoods who come to the clinic every year know that, regardless of their income level or insurance coverage, they can expect the very best quality care.  Carmen's commitment to her community has not gone unnoticed. She has been recognized for excellence in her work throughout the years. She was recently recognized at halftime by the Chicago Bears with the National Football League's, NFL, Hispanic Heritage Leadership Award, and she has been honored with the MALDEF Lifetime Achievement Award, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Community Health Leadership Award, and Premio Ohtli, the highest honor bestowed by the Government of Mexico on an individual for service to Mexicans living abroad. Illinois Governor Pat Quinn has also honored Carmen as the Latino Heritage Month ``Trailblazer of the Day.''  I was fortunate to meet Carmen and her family early in my Senate career. On so many occasions I have counted on Carmen's wise counsel and caring heart to help me through the challenges we face. If I could make one phone call before facing a tough decision on an issue of social justice, particularly in the Hispanic community, I would call Carmen Velasquez and know that her life experience, caring heart, and street-level wisdom would never disappoint me.  Carmen's perseverance and her indomitable spirit are tremendous. Her willingness to stand up as a voice for the community during her tenure as Alivio's executive director has left an incredible legacy to Chicago's Latino community enormously.  Congratulations to Carmen on a spectacular career. I thank Carmen for all her years of distinguished service. I know I speak for Alivio's professional staff, the thousands of families that have benefited from her caring leadership, and all of Chicago when I say she will be sorely missed.  I wish her the best as she opens the next chapter in her life.                          ____________________
