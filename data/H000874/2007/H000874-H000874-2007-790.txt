Sally Morin, who will be retiring after 20 years of dedicated service to the Anne Arundel County Public Schools System.  Sally Morin started her career with the school system on July 7, 1987, at Germantown Elementary in Annapolis, MD. She will complete her time with the system at Lothian Elementary School. Throughout her career, every principal for whom she has worked has noted her dedication, skills, and loyalty. They have also witnessed her magnificent ability to relate to all members of the school community--administrators, teachers, staff, parents, and, importantly, students.  While balancing a career with raising a family, Sally also went the extra mile and has been a very active member of her community. With her husband Maury and daughters, Lauri and Jeri, Sally opened her home to numerous Naval Academy midshipmen--offering a welcome respite from the rigorous coursework and intense training that these able young men and women experience at the academy. The Morin family also have been active members of their church and have been vigorous supporters of the construction of a new church building.  In retirement, Sally and Maury have decided to move to Delaware. While this naturally saddens their friends and neighbors in Anne Arundel County, I know that I join with them in wishing the Morins a very long and rewarding retirement.                          ____________________
