President, I rise today in honor of Casimir Pulaski, as we commemorate the 250th anniversary of his birth, and acknowledge his exemplary service to our country.  Casimir Pulaski was born in Warka, Poland on March 4, 1747. Before coming to America in 1777, he distinguished himself in Poland's battle for independence from Russia. Forced to flee his native country because of his activities on behalf of Polish freedom, he became an exile.  When Pulaski first arrived in America to aid the colonists in the American Revolution, he led a valiant counterattack at the Battle of Brandywine which saved the retreating American army from being cut off by the British.  At the insistence of Gen. George Washington, the Continental Congress appointed Pulaski brigadier general and the first commander of the American cavalry. His services in the field justly won him the title of ``Father of the American Cavalry.''  On October 9, 1779, at the Battle of Savannah, GA, Pulaski led a daring, but fatal, charge against the heavily fortified British forces occupying the city.  Today, the people of Illinois proudly remember General Pulaski's courageous sacrifice fighting for our Nation's independence, and his defense of the freedoms that we cherish in America.  The anniversary of Casimir Pulaski's birth will be celebrated on March 2, 1997, at a special dinner ceremony in Chicago. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the Chicago Society of the Polish National Alliance for hosting this commemorative dinner, and commend its efforts to help restore the Pulaski Monument in Savannah, GA.  The Pulaski Monument, whose cornerstone was laid by the Marquis Lafayette in 1825, is currently in a state of disrepair. With the hard work and dedication of the Chicago Society and donations from the people of Savannah, this 55-foot-tall historic monument will soon stand with renewed glory as a symbol of patriotism for all future generations of Americans.  Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to pay tribute to Brig. Gen. Casimir Pulaski on behalf of my home State of Illinois. I invite my colleagues in the Senate to join me in commemorating this heroic patriot and in honoring the many accomplishments Polish-Americans have made throughout history.                          ____________________
