President, I rise today to honor a constituent, Dr. Bruce McMillan, director of the Illinois State Museum, and congratulate him on his retirement.  Dr. McMillan began his career at the Illinois State Museum in 1969 as associate curator of anthropology. Since becoming director in 1977, Dr. McMillan has guided the museum through an expansion from two to six facilities throughout Illinois.  The Illinois State Museum serves the State of Illinois through its excellence in interdisciplinary research and its commitment to innovation in exhibits and education. With collections in the natural sciences, anthropology, and art, the museum tells the story of the land, life, people, and art of Illinois.  Dr. McMillan has brought to his work a true passion for research, travel, and the outdoors. Those who know him best call him a natural leader who inspires those around him to do things they would never try on their own. An avid outdoorsman, Dr. McMillan has led yearly field trips for friends and colleagues, including one to the dry shelters of Arkansas that has become legend amongst his friends.  Known to be a sports enthusiast, Dr. McMillan has played in the Springfield senior softball league for years and has admirably represented Illinois in the Senior Olympics. He is supported by his wife Virginia and his three children in all of his many varied pursuits.  Through his decades of service as director of the Illinois State Museum, Dr. Bruce McMillan has promoted discovery, learning, and an appreciation of Illinois' heritage. Under his leadership, the Illinois State Museum has become one of the premier State museums in the country, and the legacy he has created will continue to benefit the State of Illinois in the years to come.  Mr. President, I congratulate Dr. Bruce McMillan on his many accomplishments throughout his long and successful career, and I wish him many more years of happiness and accomplishment in retirement.                          ____________________[Page S2024]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                      HONORING DR.
