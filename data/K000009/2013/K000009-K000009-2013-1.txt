Speaker, as we end this particular legislative session, I just wanted to rise and say that, on the one hand, the vast majority of Members voted to run the government of the United States prudently and within budget and to operate as adults over the next 2 years; on the other hand, the lack of a provision in that bill to accommodate those who are unemployed across this country is a sad commentary on the leadership of this House.  In the State of Ohio where Speaker Boehner hails from, over half of the counties in Ohio are above the national unemployment average of 7 percent, which is way too high for the country as a whole. For us as a Chamber not to be able to include, especially before Christmas and the holiday season, the extension of unemployment benefits even for a few months for people who will now face Christmas and the new year with even more worry and hardship is unconscionable for this Nation. I just know that we are capable of better.  I would suggest to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee that if you shaved 1 percent off of every account in the discretionary part of the budget, you would be able to find the money to extend the benefits for 3 more months, and then we can look toward a more permanent solution from the Ways and Means Committee.  I am thankful for the opportunity to make this important statement for the Record. America can do better for our unemployed.                          ____________________
