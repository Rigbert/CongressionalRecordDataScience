In closing, Mr. Speaker, I again thank my friends on the majority side for their courtesy and for working so closely with us on this legislation. It truly is a bipartisan bill.  You know, in 2000 I was the prime sponsor of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, and added the three Ps, prevention, prosecution, and protection. And a very comprehensive effort was made. We are now 10 years into implementation of that law. The TIP report that comes out every year comes out pursuant to that law.  One of the things we did in that law was to try to get every other country to pass laws that look a lot like ours, and maybe better and then we will borrow from their ideas. In this legislation as well there is a real admonition to the President and the State Department to try to get other countries to enact Megan's Laws in their own countries--a few have them, most don't--so we can protect our kids from these pedophiles when they come to our shores.  I urge a ``yes'' vote.                                     National Center for Missing &                                           Exploited Children,                                                    July 21, 2010.     Hon. Chris Smith,     Washington, DC.       Dear Representative Smith: On behalf of the National Center      for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC), I commend you for      introducing H.R. 5138, the International Megan's Law of 2010.      This important piece of legislation will help protect      children around the world from registered sex offenders who      seek to victimize them.       Sex tourism is an insidious practice whereby offenders      travel to other countries for the purpose of sexually      victimizing a child. According to an estimate from the U.S.      Department of State, 1 million children are exploited by the      global commercial sex trade each year. Currently, there are      very few limitations regulating the international travel of      registered sex offenders. Simply requiring registration      within an offender's country of residence does nothing to      protect children in other countries from victimization. It is      imperative that we do everything we can to provide U.S. and      international law enforcement with information that might      prevent a child from being victimized.       We are grateful for your leadership and your steadfast      commitment to the most vulnerable members of our society.           Sincerely,                                                      Ernie Allen,                                                  President & CEO.  I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.
