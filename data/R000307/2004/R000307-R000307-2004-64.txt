President, with this debate and the vote certain at 5 o'clock, I think there has been an extraordinary level of examination of this nomination. Two days of open hearings were held. By way of comparison, that is one day more than Secretary of State Powell had during his confirmation in early 2001.  It is certainly understandable that an official of the DCI stature would be the subject of close Senate scrutiny. I think we have achieved that level of scrutiny, and members of the Intelligence Committee on both sides have expressed satisfaction with the way this process has unfolded. It was not by accident. It was in close conference and cooperation with the distinguished vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, the Senator from West Virginia.  I think Mr. Goss has been forthcoming. I think he has been candid with the committee. He provided literally dozens of written answers to questions sent to him by the committee, both before and after his confirmation hearings. He also provided complete and exhaustive details about his background and his professional life in connection with his nomination.  In short, I believe the examination of this nomination has been thorough and informative. The nominee and Members on both sides should be complimented for the way it has unfolded.  Expressions of support for his nomination have come from both sides of the aisle and both sides of Capitol Hill. This nominee is ready to go to work, and he is needed.  I urge the Senate to vote for his confirmation, and I look forward to working with Porter Goss as the next and, by the way, possibly last DCI.
