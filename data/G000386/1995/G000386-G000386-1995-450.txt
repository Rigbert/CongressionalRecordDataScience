 President, right now we are in the process of letting the appropriate committees know about the amendment, and reserving time for them to come over and debate if they want to debate. I do not know that there is any request for debate on it.  I am also checking with the leadership to see if there would be any obstacles to accepting the amendment. If we accept the amendment, we hope, then, that there will not be a vote on it. If the leadership does not want to accept the amendment, then I suggest that we vote on it immediately after the McConnell amendment, and we would have the yeas and nays.
