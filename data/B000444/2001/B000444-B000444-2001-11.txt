 President, before I speak on what I came over to the floor to discuss today, I would like to respond in 60 seconds to the Senator from Iowa.  I don't think the stimulus bill is about partisanship. The stimulus bill is about whether we are going to take care of workers and displaced people because of the economy or whether we are going to reward corporate entities that are not going to reinvest instantly in the economy and stimulate the economy. How can we stimulate the economy if what we are going to be ``spending'' through either tax expenditures or direct expenditures doesn't spend out for 2 years or more?  This is about fairness. The stimulus package I have seen so far is not remotely bipartisan and is in fact a serious mistake, based on what I know, unless there is some iteration in the last 12 hours of which I am unaware.                          ____________________
