 President, the State of Vermont has lost one of its greatest teachers, Graham Newell. I wish to honor this remarkable man, an important figure in our State's history in government as well as throughout its system of education.  A seventh generation Vermonter who grew up in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont, Newell returned to Vermont to teach after earning his degree in classics from the University of Chicago. For eight decades he was the quintessential educator, beginning and ending at his beloved St. Johnsbury Academy and teaching history and social sciences to college students for many years as well, serving as a professor and chair of the Social Sciences Department at Lyndon State College.  Graham Newell was a man who so highly regarded the field of education that he entered politics to be its champion in the State legislature. First elected to the Vermont House in 1953, and later elected to the Vermont Senate, he served as the chairman of both the House and Senate Education Committees. Throughout his tenure in the legislature in Montpelier, Graham Newell worked tirelessly to ensure educational opportunities for students with disabilities. Indeed, Vermont's special education bill preceded comparable legislation on the Federal levelby 20 years. He was also instrumental in the formation of the Vermont State College system and he authored a fair dismissal bill for educators.  Although Graham Newell was a Vermont delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1956 and 1964, he was one of the great practitioners of a long Vermont tradition of nonpartisan politics. He became involved in government reform, serving on the Little Hoover Commission that reorganized Vermont's State agencies, and he was appointed by President Kennedy to the National Advisory Commission on Inter-Governmental Relations. A founding member of the American Civil Liberties Union of Vermont, he championed a strict separation of church and State by opposing public busing for parochial schools.  As the resident Vermont historian at Lyndon State, he was responsible for naming all of its buildings after notable Vermonters. And, in a wonderful instance of turnabout is fair play, St. Johnsbury Academy recently honored him by renaming its foreign languages building Newell Hall.  Above all he valued equality and equal opportunity, principles that no doubt derived from his Vermont upbringing, his long study and admiration for Roman history and from his work in education.  Graham Newell taught Latin at St. Johnsbury Academy well into his nineties, long after he retired from his professorship at Lyndon State College. The indelible mark he made on the communities of St. Johnsbury and Lyndonville will not soon be forgotten. These communities need only look to the countless students whose lives he touched to see the effect he had on them.  Mr. Newell earned countless awards as an outstanding educator, historian and model citizen, including being named the Vermont Chamber of Commerce's Man of the Year in 2005.  It is exemplary citizens such as Graham Newell who have earned Vermont its reputation for civic leadership and principled politics, for sound reasoning in government, and for rising above partisan labels. Today, we honor his memory by recognizing his great commitments: to responsible citizenship, to superior education for all, to teaching, and to public service, and to shaping a future that will be worthy of our past.                          ____________________
