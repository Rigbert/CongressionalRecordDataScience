President, the letter says, and I will read a bit of it:       AARP supports your amendment to the Senate fiscal year 2006      Budget Reconciliation bill to provide for the ability of the      Secretary of Health and Human Services to participate in the      negotiations between pharmaceutical manufacturers and      prescription drug plans under the Medicare Part D program.       Prescription drug prices continue to rise much faster than      the rate of inflation. AARP's latest Rx Watchdog report      released this week found that prices for nearly 200 of the      most commonly used brand name medications rose 6.1 percent      during the 12 month period from July 2004-June 2005. At the      same time, the rate of general inflation was 3 percent. These      drug price increases particularly hit older Americans, who      use prescription drugs more than any other segment of the      U.S. population.       In two weeks, millions of older and disabled Americans will      have the opportunity to choose prescription drug coverage as      part of their 2006 Medicare benefit options. The new Medicare      prescription drug benefit will help millions of beneficiaries      afford needed medications. Improvements to the Medicare      Modernization Act are necessary to strengthen the benefit and      the Medicare program. We believe the first step is to keep      the drug benefit affordable for beneficiaries as well as      taxpayers.       While the competitive structure already existing in the MMA      may help to bring prescription drug prices down, we believe      that giving the Secretary the authority to participate in      negotiations may also help to make prescription drugs more      affordable for Medicare beneficiaries.  Mr. President, there is a bit more to the letter, but I think the Senate can get the general drift.  The AARP, the organization that represents millions of older people, explicitly tonight endorses our bipartisan amendment. They have pointed out that the cost of these medications, the ones that are so important to older people, are going up double the rate of inflation.  Let me emphasize that to the Senate. The drugs that seniors use, the prices are going up double the rate of inflation.  So we need some serious tools to contain these costs. At a time when the Federal Government ought to be using more effective tools to hold down the costs of medicine, we have locked into law a restriction on the ability of the Government to do what smart shoppers in America do every single day, and that is to use their marketplace clout, bulk purchasing power, to get the best value for them and their families. It is time to lift this outrageous, offensive restriction that is now in Medicare law that prevents the Federal Government from being a smart shopper. It is now time to stand up for taxpayers and stand up for the older people in this country. The Senate will have a chance to do that when it votes on the bipartisan amendment tomorrow that has been filed tonight, will be offered tomorrow, by Senator Snowe, a bipartisan group. I hope my colleagues will support it resoundingly.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________[Pages S12282-S12284]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                   MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT
