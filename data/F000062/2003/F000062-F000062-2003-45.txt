 President, the States also propose compromise language that would still place some of these engines off limits. To quote the letter from the Southeastern States Air Managers:       Please note that other compromise amendments which fall      short of fully restoring section 209(e)(1)(a) are, in our      opinion, unacceptable and will constrain States as discussed      above. This association and your State air pollution control      agencies would appreciate your support of removal of the Bond      amendment from S. 1584, the HUD VA appropriations bill.  Many other States are just beginning to realize the importance of this small engine provision. As we move forward with more protective air quality standards, more and more States will need to reduce emissions to comply with national standards. Those States will also need to reduce pollution from these very engines because there are so many of them and they are so very dirty. I strongly believe we should protect a State's right to do so.  We should not use this appropriations bill to take rights away from the States without knowing what we are doing, without a hearing, and without review by the authorizing committee.  As I said, this rider is the mother and father of all riders because it authorizes a major reduction in States rights with no hearings whatsoever, no ability to question Briggs & Stratton, and no ability to ask them why they said on their SEC report that this would cause no financial disadvantage to the company, that California is such a small portion of their market, and they would just pass on any additional costs to the consumer.  Why would they tell the Senate or the Senator from Missouri they would move jobs to China if this passed? The statements of Briggs & Stratton make me very suspicious.  The Clean Air Act has long recognized that States with serious air pollution problems need to be able to set strong standards to protect public health. The hard-fought 1990 Clean Air Act amendments give the States the ability to regulate these off-road engines.  With respect to the California regulation, I will work with fire officials, air resources boards, the industry, and the Senator from Missouri to ensure that the final regulation is safe. But I believe it is clear that this should not be a debate about a specific State regulation. That is our problem. We will handle it. California is entirely able and capable of handling this problem. We don't need someone else to tell us what to do.  This is a debate about making sure the States have the flexibility necessary to protect the public health.  It is hard for me to understand why anyone would do this on an appropriations bill when the consequences are so dire, with over 300 premature deaths likely to be caused by worsening air pollution, or if the State moves to further tighten stationary sources and really send a whole magnitude of companies offshore.  I don't think in an appropriations bill we should take well-earned States rights away from every State in this Union to benefit one company. Remember, every other manufacturer of small engines is going along with what California is doing. They have all said they could do it. They have all said they could adapt these standards into their manufacturing. They have all said they could change. They have all said they can add adequate heat shields.  Furthermore, the pollution from these engines under 175 horsepower accounts for 17 percent of California's mobile smog emissions. This is not minor. We are talking about 17 percent of a State that has seven nonattainment areas in it, 17 percent of their pollution, and an Air Resources Board that has accepted the industry's proposal, an industry trade council, to which Briggs & Stratton belongs, submitted a proposal they could live with to the Air Resources Board. The Air Resources Board accepted it. And now Briggs & Stratton is coming back and saying: We do not agree; we will get our Senator to put a rider in a bill--with no hearing, without understanding the consequences that this provision will move the right for every single State to protect its citizens.  That is truly wrong. This morning, I ask my colleagues to stand up for their states rights. I ask them to stand up and protect public health. I ask them to oppose this special provision on this appropriations bill put there to benefit one company when every other company says they can comply.                               Exhibit 1              [From the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute]OPEI Succeeds in Dramatically Improving California Emission Regulations       For the last two years, OPEI has been working proactively      with the staff of the     California Air Resources Board (CARB) to improve proposed      catalyst-based Tier III exhaust standards for wheeled      products, as well as new evaporative emission regulations,      based on the use of carbon canisters and/or sealed fuel      tanks, as well as less-permeable fuel tank materials and fuel      lines. On August 8, 2003, CARB staff issued a proposed      regulation that would have required wheeled products to      install high-efficiency/high-heat generating catalysts in      order to meet exhaust standards that were 50% more stringent      than the current Tier II standards. CARB's August 8th      proposal would also have required all lawn and garden      equipment to be subject to shed-based performance testing to      demonstrate that the entire piece of equipment complied with      an overall evaporative/diurnal emission standard. CARB's      August 8th proposal evaporative compliance program and      exhaust stand would have: (1) imposed enormous compliance and      product integration problems for both engine companies and      OEMs; and (2) resulted in significant safety concerns as      well, principally because of the substantial heat generated      from the high-efficiency catalysts. Through written      correspondence, the U.S. Congressional House Committee on      Government Reform, the California Fire Chiefs Associations      (CFCA), the National Association of State Fire Marshals      (NASFM), and the U.S. Consumer and Product Safety Commission      (CPSC) have gone on record as strongly opposing CARB's August      8th proposal because of the unresolved safety issues with      high-efficiency/high-heat generating catalysts and      pressurized fuel systems.       In direct response to OPEI advocacy, the California Air      Resources Board (CARB) unanimously adopted on September 25th      a modified alternative framework which: (1) relaxes the      stringency of CARB Staff's proposed Tier III      exhaust standards; and (2) substantially improves the      overall general framework for the still-to-be-defined      evaporative emission regulations. The CARB Board has      adopted industry's proposed exhaust standards which are      roughly 25% less stringent for Class I engines (less than      225 cc displacement) and 33% less stringent for Class II      engines (greater than 225 cc displacement). Based on an      economic study prepared for OPEI, the compliance costs of      the industry counterproposal should be roughly one-third      less than the costs associated with the August 8th CARB      proposal. CARB's August 8th exhaust and evaporative      proposed standards would have increased the average      compliance cost for lawn mowers by $106 and the average      compliance cost for riding mowers by $321. CARB's adopted      less stringent exhaust and more flexible evaporative      program are expected to result in an average total      compliance cost increase of $73 for walk-behind-mowers and      $189 for riding mowers.       The provisions in OPEI/EMA's counterproposal (as generally      adopted by the CARB Board) also establish a much more      straightforward and less burdensome, design-based (rather      than shed-testing) program (for all products others than      walk-behind-mowers) to demonstrate compliance with the      evaporative requirements. OPEI has also persuaded CARB to      allow the use of smaller and less-expensive carbon canisters.      The provisions in OPEI's/EMA's counterproposal (as generally      adopted by the CARB Board) provide industry with much longer      lead-time compared to the August 8th CARB proposal.      Specifically, industry has more than five years of additional      lead time to achieve the ultimate evaporative emission      requirements. This additional lead time should allow      manufacturers with adequate time to develop and use new low-     permeation barriers (such as co-extruded materials) in      constructing their fuel tanks.       The Outdoor Power Equipment Institute (OPEI) is the major      international trade association representing the      manufacturers and their suppliers of consumer and commercial      outdoor power equipment such as lawnmowers, garden tractors,      utility vehicles, trimmers, edgers, chain saws, snow      throwers, tillers, leaf blowers and other related products.      Founded in 1952, the Institute is dedicated to promoting the      outdoor power equipment industry by undertaking activities      that can be pursued more effectively by an association than      by individual companies.                                  ____                               Exhibit 2                                          Air Resources Board,                               Sacramento, CA, September 26, 2003.     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Bond: Thank you for your September 24, 2003,      letter commenting on the proposed regulation to reduce      pollution from small engines below 25 horsepower. Your letter      was received prior to the California Air Resources Board      (ARB) public hearing on this regulation, and read by each of      my fellow Board members.       Your letter urged the Board to reach ``a comprehensive      agreement with the entire small engine industry that saves      jobs while also protecting the environment and public      safety.'' I'm pleased to report that on September 25, 2003,      the Air Resources Board unanimously adopted a revised      regulation that I am confident addresses all the issues      raised in your letter on behalf of the small engine industry.      In particular, the regulation we adopted:       1. Removes any question regarding safety;       2. Results in the use of commonly available technologies      which will not require engine redesign;       3. Prevents the possible loss of jobs referred to in your      letter; and       4. Achieves nearly the same emission reductions.       The revised regulation is based on proposals we had      requested and received in the past two weeks from members of      the small engine industry. ARB staff used these proposals to      design and include in the regulation two alternative methods      of compliance. One of the alternatives closely reflects the      proposal of the Engine Manufacturers, Outdoor Power Equipment      Institute, and Briggs and Stratton.       The most important feature of the regulatory alternatives      we adopted is a less stringent exhaust emission standard      (offset by better evaporative emission controls). The new      standard will reduce the heat generated by the engine's      exhaust. Honda testified that with the revised exhaust      emission standards, safety is no longer a concern. A      representative of the California Fire Chiefs Association      testified the revised regulation appeared to address their      concerns. Similarly, a representative of the California Fire      Marshall's office told our staff he believes ARB      adequately handled the safety issues with the revised      regulation. I am confident that the testimony of these      experts assures us there will be no new safety issues      resulting from implementing this regulation.       No testimony was presented to the Board regarding job      losses and plant closures. However, I am aware that Briggs      and Stratton has said the company will have to shut down some      or all of its plants because major engine redesign would be      required to meet California's proposal to reduce small engine      emissions. I believe that statement referred to the original      proposed regulation and no longer applies. Testimony at our      hearing yesterday confirmed that relatively simple changes to      engine components would allow these small engines to meet the      revised emission standards we adopted. Better hoses and fuel      tanks would prevent fuel vapors from leaking into the      atmosphere where they form smog. A simple catalyst, similar      to the ones used on over 15 million small motorcycles and      mopeds worldwide, would reduce exhaust emissions without      creating a heat hazard to the user. The testimony was clear      that these simple changes were effective and no engine      redesign that might cause job losses would be needed. Honda      testified on the record that the regulations would not reduce      its employment or production.       I believe the action taken by the ARB is a win-win      situation. We achieved our emission reduction goal. The      adopted regulation, based on an industry proposal, will      reduce costs, simplify compliance and avoid job losses. Fire      experts stated there is no safety problem.       As you stated in your letter to me, addressing these issues      should obviate the need for Congressional action. We have      successfully addressed all the issues you raised.      Accordingly, I now request that you remove the expansive      state preemption language from the HUD/VA budget bill, so in      cooperation with small engine manufacturers, we can get on      with the job of protecting the health of 35 million      Californians.           Sincerely,                                              Alan C. Lloyd, Ph.D,     Chairman.                                  ____                               Exhibit 3         Environmental Council of the States, State and            Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators,            Association of Local Air Pollution Control Officials,                                                 October 24, 2003.       Dear Senator: We write to you today on behalf of the      Environmental Council of the States (ECOS), the State and      Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators (STAPPA) and      the Association of Local Air Pollution Control Officials      (ALAPCO) to urge your support for amendments to strike a      provision of the VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies FY 2004      appropriations bill that would amend Section 209(e)(1)(A) of      the Clean Air Act to curtail states' authority to clean up      diesel and gasoline off-road equipment and engines.       Emissions from off-road engines contribute significantly      and increasingly to ozone and fine particulate matter      (PM2.5) pollution and are responsible for a      variety of serious public health impacts. As state and local      environmental agencies work to develop strategies for      attaining and maintaining health-based National Ambient Air      Quality Standards for ozone and PM2.5, they will      look to the regulation of off-road engines as a means for      achieving their clean air goals.       The provision in the VA-HUD appropriations bill to amend      Section 209 would have broad adverse consequences with      respect to the ability of states to seek emission reductions      from off-road engines. First, the provision would prevent not      only California, but all other states as well, from setting      new emission standards or enforcing existing standards for      all off-road engines under 175 horsepower (hp), including,      among others, those used in lawn and garden equipment,      generators, forklifts, airport ground support equipment and      mining equipment. Second, the provision would also preclude      states from regulating off-road engines above 175 hp if the      engines are certified in the same engine ``family'' as      certain off-road engines under 175 hp. Third, the provision      would prevent states from pursuing ``retrofit'' programs to      clean up older, dirtier engines. In short, if this provision      to amend Section 209 of the Act is retained in the VA-HUD      appropriations bill, states' clean air efforts will be     thwarted and they will be forced to seek further, likely less      cost effective, reductions in emissions from other sources      that are already well controlled, including small businesses.       As the Clean Air Act appropriately recognizes, states are      best suited to determine which sources contribute most      significantly to air pollution in their respective      jurisdictions and which programs will be most effective in      addressing their specific problems. ECOS, STAPPA and ALAPCO      urge that you support amendments to strike this off-road      provision from the VA-HUD appropriations bill and preserve      states' rights to pursue healthier air for our nation.           Sincerely,     R. Steven Brown,       Executive Director, ECOS.     S. William Becker,       Executive Director, STAPPA and ALAPCO.
