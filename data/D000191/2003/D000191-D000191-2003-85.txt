Speaker, last fall the President's economic adviser, Larry Lindsey, said the war in Iraq could cause $100 billion to $200 billion. Well, Wolfowitz, Rumsfeld, said, ``That is absurd. Those are crazy numbers.'' In fact, Wolfowitz said, ``Don't worry, they can pay for their own reconstruction.''  Now, the President is asking Congress to borrow $87 billion in the name of the American people, $20 billion of that to rebuild the infrastructure of Iraq.  Now, it is nice that we want to build a $150 million children's hospital in Iraq, but American kids lack basic health care. Where is the money for that?  It is nice that they want to rebuild the Port of Umm Qasr, $80 million. The President has zeroed out dredging ports in my district.  Billions for the electric grid; not a penny for the faltering electric grid in the United States of America.  $20 billion invested here would create 1 million U.S. jobs. $20 billion in Iraq is a drop in the bucket of what it is really going to cost, but it will produce some nice profits for Halliburton.                          ____________________
