President, I want to bring to the attention of my colleagues a courageous Ecuadoran journalist who has been recognized by the Committee to Protect Journalists International Press.  Janet Hinostroza has anchored the investigative news show ``30 Plus'' for the past decade and hosted the news program ``La Manana de 24 Horas,'' both on the private Ecuadoran television channel Teleamazonas. She also hosts a radio program on 98.1 FM Mundo and is the local correspondent for Univision, while managing a production company specializing in journalistic programming and audiovisual products.  Ms. Hinostroza has attracted the wrath of the Ecuadoran authorities for reporting on such important issues as human and arms trafficking, the Ecuadoran police, corruption, and extrajudicial killings. She recently investigated a scandal involving a loan by a state-owned bank to a businessman who defaulted. I am informed that her reporting uncovered irregularities in the loan and connected the businessman to the then-head of Ecuador's central bank, who was President Rafael Correa's cousin. As a result, she received anonymous phone calls threatening her safety and she had to temporarily leave her television news program.  Teleamazonas, like many Ecuadoran news outlets that engage in reporting critical of the government, is regularly targeted with harassment by official censors. Ms. Hinostroza's program is required to designate regular time slots, legally reserved for reporting official information in times of crisis, to present presidential rebuttals to her reports, contrary to Ecuador's broadcast laws.  In recognition of Ms. Hinostroza's brave and important work and commitment to fighting for a free press, next month the Committee to Protect Journalists will award Ms. Hinostroza the International Award for Freedom of the Press.  Unfortunately, the harassment of Ms. Hinostroza is only one example of a steady deterioration of democratic principles in Ecuador. It is the responsibility of democratic governments to foster an environment of pluralism, and nothing is more basic to that than public access to information from a free press. Instead, the Ecuadoran Government has carried out a relentless assault on the media, and recently it went a step further by restricting the autonomy of nongovernmental organizations.  A decree adopted in June creates burdensome new procedures for nongovernmental organizations, both Ecuadoran and international, to obtain legal status to operate in the country. Like a free press, civil society plays a crucial oversight role in any democratic society. The Ecuadoran decree is similar to what we have seen in other countries whose repressive governments are using laws and decrees to silence their critics.  I ask unanimous consent that excerpts from a recent report by Human Rights Watch about the Correa government's latest efforts to consolidate power and silence its critics be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From Human Rights Watch, Aug. 12, 2013]                  Ecuador: Clampdown on Civil Society       (Washington, DC).--Ecuador should revoke a presidential      decree that grants far-reaching powers to the government to      oversee and dissolve nongovernmental organizations, Human      Rights Watch said today.       On June 4, 2013, President Rafael Correa adopted a decree      that creates new procedures for Ecuadorean nongovernmental      organizations to obtain legal status and requires      international organizations to undergo a screening process to      seek permission to work in Ecuador. The decree also grants      the government broad powers to intervene in groups'      operations. It gives the government authority, for example,      to dissolve Ecuadorean groups for ``compromis[ing] public      peace.''       ``The Correa administration has damaged free speech,      expending a lot of its energy focusing on the media, and now      it's trying to trample on independent groups,'' said Jose      Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch.      ``Officials can now essentially decide what groups may say or      do, seriously undermining their role as a check on the      government.''       Correa presented a draft proposal of a similar decree in      December 2010, but it was shelved after criticism from local      and international groups.       Under the decree, the authorities are creating an      electronic Unified System of Information of Social Groups,      which would store documentation from organizations.      Ecuadorean organizations are required to file a series of      documents to obtain legal status and approval of their by-     laws. Groups have one year from the publication of the decree      on June 20 to present the required paperwork.       Government officials from ministries related to the work      done by the group--for example, the Health Ministry if the      group works on health-related topics--review the      documentation and have the authority to grant or deny the      group legal status. Once they obtain legal status, groups      must inform authorities when they select directors and a      legal representative and if they add or remove members. They      must also provide the government with information about      projects with international funding, and get government      authorization to revise their by-laws.       The decree limits groups' ability to choose who can be a      member or participant, undermining their right to free      assembly, Human Rights Watch said. The decree imposes on      Ecuadorean groups an obligation to respect the ``right'' of      anyone who ``due to their place of residency or having a      specific labor, institutional, union, occupational, or      professional qualification directly related to the objective      or nature and/or purposes of the organization, is interested      in participating in it.'' Groups with certain territorial      coverage or those that are ``the only ones in their      location'' may not reject people with a ``legitimate      interest'' in participating.       The government officials who grant a group legal status      have broad monitoring powers to make sure that it only      carries out `authorized' work. Officials may dissolve a group      if they consider the organization is ``mov[ing] away from the      objectives for which it was created,'' or if it is involved      in activities that ``compromise public peace'' or ``interfere      with public policies that undermine national or external      security of the state.''       International groups seeking to work in Ecuador must      request permission from the Technical Secretariat of      International Cooperation, providing information on the      ``purposes and work they wish to carry out in the country.''      They have to provide documents that ``demonstrate [their]      legal existence,'' including their by-laws in Spanish. The      government will then ask Ecuadorean embassies and consulates      in countries where the international group operates for      information about the ``legality, solvency, and seriousness''      of the organization. Based on this information, it will      decide whether to sign an agreement with the international      group to authorize it to work in Ecuador.       The decree also imposes vaguely defined prohibitions on      international groups--for instance, they are not allowed to      conduct activities that ``undermine security and public      peace.'' It also allows government officials to monitor a      group's activities ``to ensure the true fulfillment of its      obligations'' and to revoke the international agreement if      they decide the group violates it.       On August 7, a lower court judge rejected a constitutional      challenge filed by Fundamedios, an organization that monitors      freedom of expression, against the decree. The group has      filed an appeal, which remains pending before the courts.       Under international law, however, as part of their duty to      promote and protect human rights, governments must ensure      that human rights defenders are allowed to pursue their      activities without reprisals, threats, intimidation,      harassment, discrimination, or unnecessary legal obstacles.      The Inter-American Court of Human Rights held in 2003 that      ``[r]espect for human rights in a democratic state depends      largely on human rights defenders enjoying effective and      adequate guarantees so as to freely go about their      activities, and it is advisable to pay special attention to      those actions that limit or hinder the work of human rights      defenders.''       The rights to freedom of expression and association may be      subject to limitations, but the limitations must adhere to      strict standards so that they do not improperly impede the      exercise of those rights. Any restrictions should be      ``prescribed by law, necessary in a democratic society, and      proportionate to the aim pursued'' and should not ``harm the      principles of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness.''       Article 16 of the American Convention on Human Rights      states that the right of freedom of association ``shall be      subject only to such restrictions established by law as may      be necessary in a democratic society, in the     interest of national security, public safety or public order,      or to protect public health or morals or the rights and      freedoms of others.''       In 2012, the UN special rapporteur on the rights to freedom      of peaceful assembly and of association has called on      countries to ensure that these rights ``are enjoyed by      everyone and any registered or unregistered entities'' and      that no one is subject to ``harassment, persecution,      intimidation or reprisals'' for exercising them. Moreover,      the rapporteur has stated that, ``[s]uspension or involuntary      dissolution of associations should be sanctioned by an      impartial and independent court in case of a clear and      imminent danger resulting in a flagrant violation of domestic      laws, in compliance with international human rights law.''       ``Instead of adopting reasonable measures to facilitate the      work of nongovernmental organizations, the Correa      administration is following the lead of countries such as      Russia, Bahrain, Uganda, and Venezuela, which have imposed      unjustified restrictions that violate fundamental rights and      limit spaces that are critical to democratic society,''      Vivanco said.                          ____________________
