  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman before me waxed eloquent about a $400 billion Rube Goldberg complete with subsidies for the pharmaceutical industry, the insurance industry and price fixing. It is going to guarantee that there will be no reduction in the extortionate price of prescription drugs. Americans will still continue to pay the highest prices in the developed world despite the fact that the drugs are manufactured here by American companies who often receive the benefit of taxpayer-funded research.  We could provide a much more meaningful benefit for substantially less and that would be if we did two simple things: Negotiate lower prices like every other nation in the world has done, but this bill prohibits the government from negotiating lower prices on behalf of Americans or Medicare beneficiaries. And, secondly, we could just engage in free trade, allow the reimportation of U.S.-manufactured, FDA-approved drugs. That would substantially lower the price. Many American seniors have already resorted to that, but this bill will prohibit the reimportation of drugs but instead it will engage in subsidizing private insurance, subsidizing the pharmaceutical industry, price fixing and protectionism. They are violating every principle they say they believe in.                          ____________________
