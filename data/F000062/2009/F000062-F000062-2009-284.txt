 President, I am pleased to join Senator Lieberman and my Senate colleagues in introducing legislation to reauthorize the District of Columbia's pilot scholarship program for 5 more years.  This important program currently provides scholarships to 1,700 low-income children who attend 49 private schools in the District. The scholarships of up to $7,500 help these students pay for tuition and transportation expenses to school.  However, if the program is not extended soon, children will not be able to continue their education at the schools of their choice.  This legislation would:  Extend the life of the District of Columbia's pilot scholarship program for five more years.  Increase the program's funding to $20 million for fiscal year 2010 and as may be necessary the following four years to allow new students to participate in the program and provide a higher scholarship.  Increase the scholarship amount to $9,000 for children in kindergarten through 8th grade, and $11,000 for youngsters in high school--this amount is still lower than the $15,500 cost of educating a public school student in the District and will help low-income families afford the high cost of private school tuition.  Protect low-income families whose children are already in the program from ``earning out'' of it by setting the maximum income level for them at 300 percent of the Federal poverty level, about $63,000 for a family of four.  However, it maintains the current income eligibility requirement for students to enter the program of 185 percent of poverty, $41,000 for a family of four.  It would improve evaluation by assessing students' college admission rates, school safety, and the reasons why parents choose to participate in program to better learn about its impact on children's lives and their families.  It would give priority for awarding scholarships also to students whose household includes a sibling or other child already participating in the program.  When students entered the program 5 years ago, they were performing in the bottom third on reading and math tests.  Students are now improving academically--despite the many challenges that these children face outside the classroom living in some of the District's toughest neighborhoods.  The most recent evaluation from this past April by the Education Department's Institute of Education Sciences found that although math test scores have not increased so far, there are significant gains being made in reading test scores.  Specifically, pilot program students scored 4.5 points higher in reading on the SAT-9 national standardized test with a total score of 635.4 when compared to the District's public school students' score of 630.9.  This means students are making gains in reading test scores by the equivalent of 3 months of additional schooling, and moved to the 35th percentile on the SAT-9 from the 33rd percentile where they were before entering the program.  These youngsters still have much more catching up to do, but they are improving and this is important.  I believe the results of the more comprehensive evaluation of student performance that will be released next spring are critical.  Next year's evaluation will also include important data on the program's impact on students' college enrollment and how the District's public schools are changing in response to the pilot program.  I would like to share two examples of how the program has helped to change the lives of the District's most disadvantaged youngsters and give them a chance to succeed.  Shirley-Ann Tomdio is the 8th grade Valedictorian at Sacred Heart Middle School, located in the District's neighborhood of Columbia Heights.  The scholarship allowed Shirley-Ann to attend Sacred Heart School for the past four years since 5th grade.  She will be attending Georgetown Visitation in September for high school.  She wants to go to college and become a surgeon.  Shirley-Ann said at her 8th grade graduation speech this past June:       The D.C. OSP [Opportunity Scholarship Program] is important      to me because without it I wouldn't be able to receive the      best education possible. It should continue so that my      brother, sister, and other students get the same chance.      Every child should get the chance to go to a good school.  Oscar Machado is a graduate of Archbishop Carroll High School where he was on Honor Roll.  Oscar is attending Mount Saint Mary's University in Maryland in the fall and plans to major in biology. He received three college scholarships that will cover nearly all of this tuition.  He was in the pilot program for 4 years.  At Archbishop Carroll High, he was President of the Robotics Team where he used pre-engineering skills to build robots, and also played the saxophone in the school band.  When speaking of his experience as a D.C. Opportunity Scholarship recipient Oscar said:       The scholarship was great. It gave me the opportunity to      attend a school I otherwise couldn't have attended.  Oscar hopes that the same opportunity should be available to other students.  We should listen to students like Oscar and Shirley-Ann, and continue to provide this important program to the District's neediest children.  I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to pass this legislation.                          ____________________
