 President, Senator Cornyn has been working very faithfully with us on this issue, so I don't take exception to anything he said except to clarify from my position what I want to accomplish.  First, I don't ever pretend to make perfect legislation. The English language doesn't allow that, even if that is the good intent. We have had several variations of the amendment that is before us and on which we will be voting. I have always made an attempt to do things through my committee in a bipartisan way. This is a bipartisan amendment. If there is an issue with this amendment that it may not be the linchpin for the verification we want, we are going to have an opportunity in conference to fine-tune this amendment. I want the Senator from Texas to know that I am open to that, and I hope--I haven't talked to my cosponsors, but I hope the cosponsors are also open to it because everybody indicated their intent to make sure the verification system works.  With that in mind, I hope this amendment will be adopted so we can move this process forward, and anything that needs to be done with this amendment, including all of the objections that have been raised, will be taken care of in conference.  I think we have a good compromise, so I am not starting out with the idea that we have to correct it, but we are going to try to address all these concerns because this is a very key part of any immigration bill that we pass.  I yield the floor.
