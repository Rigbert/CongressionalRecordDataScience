Chairman, there has been a misunderstanding here. I want to ask the chairman a question, because apparently I misunderstood.  I was sitting over here, obviously trying to keep track of the debate while there were discussions about what we were doing on the bill. I was brought a paper with the amendments, and I know the gentleman added a couple, and that was fine, and I did not object. But very frankly, I did not object on the premise that we were going to suspend further proceedings of the bill at this time. I was told that. That may have been an error, but that is what I was told.
