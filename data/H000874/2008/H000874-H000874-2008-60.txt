And I thank Mr. McKeon for his leadership and willingness to work together on a difficult issue.  I certainly want to acknowledge and thank my friend Jim Sensenbrenner, Congressman Sensenbrenner, who has been chairman of the committee, the Judiciary Committee, who has been a leader in this Congress, and his wife, Cheryl. Cheryl, like the young man we just saw speak, Congressman Jim Langevin, has shown great courage, but also has shown that disability is not disabling; that we ought to look at the ability people have, what they can do, not what they can't do. All of us can't do certain things. I urge people to look at what people can do. And that's what this bill was about in 1990. That's what this bill is about today.  And I am very pleased to be here to speak on behalf of this bill. I think this bill may well pass unanimously, and the public might conclude, therefore, that this was not contentious and difficult, it was both--not contentious in terms of enabling those with disabilities to be fully included in our society, but how to do that; how to do that in the context of making sure that the business community could live with this, that the disabilities community could live with this, and that we did, in fact, accomplish the objectives that we intended.  I want to thank as well the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and other business groups who came together with the disabilities community with a common objective. Randy Johnson worked on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce. And Randy Johnson, at a press conference that was held when the Senate passed this bill just a few days ago, said that he was a staffer here in 1988 and '89 and '90 when we passed the Americans with Disabilities Act. And he made the observation that--he sat on the floor, he worked with the leadership on the Republican side and the Democratic side, worked particularly with my friend, Steve Bartlett, Congressman Steve Bartlett from Texas, who was intimately involved in fashioning and working out the compromises necessary to overwhelmingly pass the ADA in 1990. And he said it was clear then that the intent of Congress had been misconstrued by the Supreme Court--this is Randy Johnson, Republican staffer, leader now in the Chamber of Commerce of the United States who helped fashion this bill. And this bill really says, yes, we agree with that in a bipartisan way. The Supreme Court misinterpreted what our intent was. And our intent was to be inclusive.  Civil rights bills are intended to be interpreted broadly. Why? Because we want to make sure that every American has the benefits that America has to offer, the opportunities that America has to offer, and to empower them to help America be a better country, to bring their talents and their skills and their motivation to bear in the public and private sectors.  I want to thank as well Nancy Zirkin, Andy Imperato, my--as I call him my lawyer, Chai Feldblum, who has worked so hard on this for now 20-plus years. It's been 18 years since we passed the ADA, but as Mr. Miller knows, it's been 20-plus years--25 years really--that we've been working on getting to this point.  I also want to thank Mike Peterson of H.R. Policy and Jerry Gillespie of the National Association of Manufacturers.  There are so many people that I could spend the next 5 or 10 minutes mentioning just name after name after name who made this happen. I won't do that, not to diminish them in any way, but to say that this is the result of the efforts of many--not of me, but of many; not of Mr. Miller alone or the ranking member alone or Mr. Sensenbrenner, but many dedicated to this cause.  We are here to build on the accomplishments of the landmark Disabilities Act of 1990. We wouldn't be here at all, however, without the hard work, frankly, of a very close friend of mine, former Member of Congress, Tony Coelho. Tony Coelho had a vision. Tony Coelho suffers from epilepsy. There is nobody who knows Tony Coelho that thinks he is not able to do anything, everything, and all things. Tony Coelho empowered all of us to think larger, to understand how to bring about real change for those with disabilities.  Tony Coelho, an epileptic, was asked to leave the seminary because he had epilepsy because the church concluded he really couldn't do the job. It was the church's loss and our gain. He made a tremendous contribution to this institution. But much more importantly, inthe last some 20 years that he has not been a Member of this institution he continued to make an extraordinary contribution, not just to those with disabilities, but to our society, in expanding our consciousness and inclusion.  And I mention his name, but I also want to thank my friend, Steve Bartlett. Steve Bartlett, Congressman, then the Mayor of Dallas, now in the private sector, but engaged in the eighties and nineties and engaged in the passage of this bill today, was extraordinarily helpful to us. In 1990, the original ADA was the product of the vision of so many.  I also want to thank my former staffer, Melissa Schulman, who worked indefatigably as we passed the ADA in 1990.  When the first President Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act 18 years ago, America became the world's leader on this central test of human rights. The ADA was a project in keeping with our oldest principles and founding ideals. As President Bush the first, as I call him, put it at the signing ceremony, and I quote, ``Today's legislation,'' he said, ``brings us closer to that day when no Americans will ever again be deprived of their basic guarantee of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.''  Thanks to the ADA, that day became closer on July 26, 1990. Thanks to the passage of this bill today and the signatures Mr. Miller indicated next week, and the expected signatures of the President, with hopefully the first President Bush present, tens of millions of Americans with disabilities will now enjoy even fuller rights, and the rights that we intended them to enjoy when we passed the ADA--the right to use the same streets, theaters, restrooms or offices, the right to prove themselves in the workplace, to succeed on their talent and drive alone.  We've accomplished much in terms of public accommodations, in terms of reasonable accommodations. I was sitting there with Michele Stockwell, my policy director, as we watched Jim Langevin give his speech. What a wonderful accommodation he has in that chair that stands up. Weren't all of you impressed when he said, ``I rise to support this legislation?'' ``I rise.'' And he does rise. Why? Because he has a reasonable accommodation which, notwithstanding the failure of his legs to work the way he would like them to work, his chair reasonably accommodates and has him rise to speak to this body as a testimony to the consciousness of having been raised to make sure that a person like Jim Langevin--of great ability, of great ability, not disability, but of great ability--can come here, having been shot at the age of 16 inadvertently, by accident, disabled, graduated from high school, graduated from college, elected to the Rhode Island House, elected to Secretary of State of his State, and now a Member of this body. What a testimony to making sure that we made sure Jim Langevin could get through the door; we made sure Jim Langevin could get the kind of education he wanted and have access to that education. What a testimony to what this Congress has done, but more importantly, what so many courageous people with a disability have shown us all, that a disability is not disabling. It may rob us of a single or maybe even multiple ways that some people do things, but not of all things.  Sadly, as a result of the Supreme Court's decision, we have yet to live up to our promise fully. That's what we're trying to do today. We've made progress on access, we've made progress on listening devices, a lot of progress. One of the places we haven't made the progress we wanted to was employment. So many people want to work, want to be self-sufficient, want to be enterprising, want to have the self-respect of earning their own way, but have been shut out. And the Supreme Court didn't help us. That's what this bill is about.  Over the last 18 years, the Court has chipped away at that promise and at Congress' clear original intent. We said we wanted broad coverage for people with disabilities and people regarded as disabled. Important phrase, ``regarded as disabled.'' What the Supreme Court really said, well, if you can make sure that your disability does not disable you. Tony Coelho takes medicine for his epilepsy, and so he functions. And if you saw him, you would say he's functioning fine. But if I said, but I won't hire you, Tony, because you have epilepsy, the Court said that was okay. Nobody on this floor believed that was the case. If he was discriminated against because he had a disability but could do the job, we said that's wrong. The Court did not agree with us, and we're now changing that and making sure that our intent will be lived out.  We never expected that the people with disabilities who work to mitigate their conditions would have their efforts held against them, but the courts did exactly that. Those narrow rulings, which will be changed by this legislation, have closed the door of opportunity for millions of Americans. We're here today to bring those millions of our fellow citizens back to where they belong--where we want them, where we need them, under the protection of the ADA.  By voting for final passage of the ADA Amendment Act, we ensure that the definition of disability will henceforth be construed broadly and fairly. We make it clear that those who manage to mitigate their disabilities can still be subject to discrimination; we know that intuitively and practically. This legislation says we know it legislatively. And we recognize that those regarded as having a disability are equally at risk and deserve to be equally protected.                              {time}  1200  This bill, which was approved by the Senate last week unanimously, has come so close to a signature thanks to the tireless work of the members of the disability community, leaders from both parties and business groups, a coalition as broad and deep as the one that created the original ADA.  I want to recognize the cosponsor of this bill, as I said earlier, Jim Sensenbrenner, tireless in his advocacy, and his wife, Cheryl. I want to thank my good friend Tony Coelho. As I said at a press conference last week, I have served in the Congress for 28 years. There will be a time when I will retire. And I will look back on my career. And one of the proudest achievements I will have is the work that I have done at Tony's insistence and request on behalf of the Americans with Disabilities Act and those who are challenged by being shut out of our society.  Finally, it is my honor to dedicate this bill to a pioneering disability advocate and an inspiration behind the ADA. He is listening to us. He died some years ago. His name was Justin Dart. Justin Dart, like Jim Langevin, was in a wheelchair. It didn't disable him. Indeed, it empowered him. It empowered him to educate all of us. It empowered him to educate those with disabilities as to what they could do and accomplish by their efforts to join together, to educate us and to educate the country. His bride, Yoshiko Dart, carries on that torch.  When Justin Dart spoke last that I heard him at the White House, he said I may not be with you for a long time. But I want you to keep on keeping on. Justin, that is what we do today.  Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time.  I commend the leader for his eloquence and for the great work that he has done on this bill; likewise Mr. Sensenbrenner, Mr. Miller, Mr. Langevin, and all those who have worked so hard for bringing forth this bill and for bringing it to this point.  Back in June, I had the privilege to join advocates for Americans with disabilities and many of the Congressional leaders who made that bill possible at a rally in support of this bill. At that time, we made it clear that we needed to get a bill to the President for his signature this year. This is a bill that cannot wait another year. That is why I'm so pleased to be standing here preparing to give final approval to this important legislation.  Once again I want to recognize Chairman Miller, the leaders of the Judiciary, Transportation and Infrastructure, Energy and Commerce Committees and the members of leadership on both sides of the aisle for shepherding this bill through the process and insisting on an open, inclusive process. This bill is better for it. I also want to recognize the members of my staff who worked hard on this legislation, Jim Paretti, Ken Serafin and Ed Gilroy from my staff helped to make this billa reality. This is a bill that fulfills our goal of providing strong, balanced and workable protections to ensure that individuals with disabilities can participate more fully in the workforce and in our society.  Mr. Speaker, there are some other comments I would like to make at this time. I think this bill has been a marvelous example of how Congress can work together. It's one that we've worked on now for a number of years. In the last Congress, Chairman Sensenbrenner introduced this bill. It was introduced in many committees. Many hearings were held. Markups were held. It carried over into this Congress. Under a change of leadership it moved forward. Again, hearings were held. Markups were held. It was passed through the body here in the House. It went to the other side. The other body took this bill up, passed it through regular order and improved the bill. And we find it now back before us in the concluding weeks of this Congress. All of us have worked together to make it a good product that will help the individuals with disabilities that it's meant to help. And I think it makes me proud to be a part of this body to have been able to participate in this process.  Last night we participated in a process that made me not so proud of this body. I understand political process. I understand that we have an election coming up. And I understand that there are times when politics rises above policy. But it still disappointed me to see a bill presented Monday night, no bipartisanship, no hearings, no regular process. Right up here above us it says, ``Let us develop the resources of our land, call forth its powers, build up its institutions.'' It's a direction that we're supposed to be operating under.  This bill was brought up Monday night to address a very, very important issue in our country. We are dependent upon other countries for resources to run our energy, to run this country. It puts us in a very difficult position. It's an issue that is equally as important I think as this bill that we are working on here right now. If it had been addressed in the same way, if we had been able to work together the way we've worked on this bill, I think the country would have been much better served. As it is, we are left with a political statement, a bill that everybody in this body knows is going nowhere, that will do nothing to actually solve the problem of energy, something that will be pushed into the next Congress. Hopefully at that point we can sit down and as adults, as Americans, as leaders that have been elected by the people we serve to come here and work through a good process to really solve a problem that is very, very important to our constituents and to our Nation and to our growth in a time of very serious issues confronting our country. It's my hope that we will be able to do that. I'm saddened by what happened yesterday. But as I said, I understand the process. I understand we're facing an election.  Having said that, seeing this body work at its best and I think at very, very far from its best, I do urge passage of the ADA Amendments Act.  I yield back the balance of my time.
