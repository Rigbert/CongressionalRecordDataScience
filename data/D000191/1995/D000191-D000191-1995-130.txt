  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor because I heard an extraordinary exchange earlier between the Democratic leader, who justly slammed the Republicans' budget for its cuts in student loans and grants that will add $5,000 to the debt burden of the typical financial aid student graduating from college in future years for families that earn less than $75,000 a year. A Republican freshman rose on the other side to say he would sacrifice for the sake of his daughter, he would take those financial aid cuts for the sake of his daughter.  Well, I have got news for him. He earns $133,000 a year as a Member of Congress. He had a successful career as a sportscaster. His daughter does not need help to go to college, but millions of other American kids do who come from families of modest means, and he is stomping on their fingers as they try and reach that first rung of the ladder to climb up to the success that we all strive for in this country.  These cuts are cruel and they fall only on families who earn less than $75,000 a year. That is the Republican budget's answer for student financial aid.                          ____________________
