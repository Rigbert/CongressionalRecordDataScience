 President, yesterday I gave an address to the World Affairs Council in Los Angeles, CA on America's role in the world. I ask unanimous consent to print my address in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Today America faces four great international challenges:      the war on terror, the situation in Iraq, the Israel-     Palestinian dispute, and the crisis in North Korea. These      four present challenges to our Nation greater than any our      Nation has faced in decades.       With respect to the ongoing war on terror, which centers      around Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida, I can report substantial      progress. The United States with its allies and the Northern      Alliance succeeded in dispersing the Taliban government and      putting al-Qaida operatives on the run. The government of      Hamid Karzai is reasserting control over Afghanistan,      although the going is difficult.       The security situation in Afghanistan is improving. We have      7,500 troops on the ground, and our allies, 5,000; they are      providing security until the new government of Afghanistan is      able to train military and police.       And, as a final action in the last Congress, a new      Department of Homeland Security has been created to better      coordinate efforts to safeguard the American people from      terrorist attacks.       On the negative side, however, Osama bin Laden and many of      his senior lieutenants are most probably still alive, along      with hundreds, and possibly thousands of followers. They      remain extremely dangerous.       And while Mullah Omar and the Taliban have been removed      from power, they lurk in the remote areas of Afghanistan      along the border with Pakistan and wait for a sign of      weakness so they can return.       Bottom line, if we are to be successful in the war on      terror, it is critical that Osama bin Laden, Mullah Omar, and      other senior Taliban and al-Qaida operatives be brought to      justice.       So, we must stay the course in Afghanistan. And wherever      the war on terror takes us, we must not allow ourselves to      get distracted or take our eye off the ball.       We must ensure that the Afghan economy and infrastructure      are rebuilt. We must protect this fledgling democracy so it      can survive and the Afghan people can flourish.       Just last week, Paul Wolfowitz, Deputy Secretary of      Defense, said from Kabul that ``stability and security'' must      be the goal. I agree.       Internationally, we must relentlessly pursue those who      would use terror to destroy us. That must be our mission and      it must be sustained until the job is finished.       With regard to Iraq, let me begin by saying categorically      that no information has been presented to the Senate to date      to connect Iraq to 9-11 or to any al-Qaida terrorist attack.       Nevertheless, Vice President Cheney laid the groundwork for      a preemptive U.S. military strike against Iraq in a major      speech last August 26, stating that Iraq either is, or would      imminently be, a nuclear power.       But he provided no evidence to back up this accusation      either publicly to the American people or privately, on a      classified basis, to the Senate. He was, I believe, laying      the ground work for a unilateral and preemptive attack on      Iraq.       Then, however, in a welcome shift of position, the      President went to the United Nations on September 12 and      strongly urged the Security Council to compel Iraqi      compliance with the 16 resolutions Iraq has defied over the      past 11 years.       The President has repeatedly stated that the United States      will lead ``a coalition of the willing'' to compel Iraq's      compliance. In September, it appeared that the President had      turned away from a unilateral course of action to a      multilateral one. That was good and welcome news.       On October 10, I voted for a Senate Resolution that would      have required the President to return to the Security Council      for a vote before launching a military strike against Iraq.      That resolution was defeated.       Subsequently, and based on the President's support for      acting in concert with the UN Security Council, I joined 76      of my colleagues and voted to support a resolution      authorizing the President to use of force to compel      compliance if necessary.       Since November 24, the UN inspection teams have inspected      Iraqi facilities that produce chemicals and pharmaceuticals,      Saddam's palace compounds, health care centers, water plants,      and numerous other facilities where old records, prior      inspections, or intelligence indicate chemical, biological or      nuclear weapons or missiles might either be made or secreted.       The International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, is also in      the process of doubling the number of inspectors.       On December 7, Iraq gave the United Nations a 12,000-page      account of its chemical, biological, nuclear, and missile      programs.       And on December 28, Iraq provided the UN inspectors with      the list of Iraqis participating in its weapons programs.       January 27 is a key date. On that day, the findings of the      IAEA inspectors will be detailed, and any discrepancies      between what they have found thus far and Iraq's earlier      declaration should be revealed.       Inspections to date have produced no evidence sufficient to      clearly establish continuing culpability in the production of      weapons of mass destruction.       However, Iraq is not yet cooperating fully with the UN      inspectors as the Security Council demanded. Saddam may well      be up to his old tricks, moving weapons or other      incriminating evidence from place to place. The history is a      sordid one.       If there is clear evidence that Iraq is continuing an      illegal program to produce weapons of mass destruction; or      has submitted inaccurate or false information regarding its      nuclear and biological programs; or has secret programs,      facilities, or stockpiles; then the administration should      make it public.       And, if there is hard evidence of weapons of mass      destruction, then the Security Council must take immediate      action to compel compliance, including using force, if      necessary. And I would support such action.       But the massive increase of U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf      appears to be an indication that regardless of the findings      of the UN inspectors the President may well intend to use      military force to bring about regime change in Iraq. This is      deeply disturbing.       I strongly believe that the arms inspectors must be allowed      to complete their task, to report back to the UN Security      Council, and the Security Council must then consider action.       In the meantime, Iraq is effectively contained and      prevented from developing weapons of mass destruction. It is      not an imminent threat to its neighbors or the United States.      And there is no need for precipitous action under these      circumstances.       A preemptive unilateral attack against a Muslim nation may      well create a divide between the U.S. and the Muslim world so      deep and wide that it will bring with it negative      consequences for decades.       There are efforts being made behind the scenes by Arab      nations to achieve a peaceful regime change. These efforts      should be given the opportunity to succeed. What is the rush      to bring the tragedy of war?       If Iraq can be successfully contained and disarmed and war      can be avoided, if the deaths of innocent people can be      prevented,     then that must be our course. War must be a last resort.       Let me make a few comments about one additional issue      before discussing North Korea: A solution must be found to      the Israeli-Palestinian crisis, and soon.       Unfortunately, it has not been, in my view, a high enough      priority for the administration. As long as the Israeli-     Palestinian crisis escalates, the risks of catastrophe remain      unabated. Yet, one of the few things that most Israelis and      most Palestinians agree on is that the United States is a      unique third party capable of advancing the peace process.       Peace between Israel and the Palestinians is clearly in the      U.S. national interest and would produce broader benefits as      well: it would increase cooperation in the Islamic world in      the war on terror; it would help us secure assistance from      the Islamic world in pressuring Saddam Hussein to disarm; and      it would restore credibility and momentum worldwide for      American diplomacy and influence.       Right after the January 28th Israeli election, I believe      President Bush should name a very senior and experienced      person to be his personal emissary dealing with the Israeli-     Palestinian crisis. The Israeli-Palestinian problem demands      more creative and higher-level attention by the United      States. It must be solved. Time is running out.       Now, with regard to North Korea I believe the situation is      more menacing than that in Iraq. It presents a substantial      and real danger to stability throughout the Asia-Pacific      region and could ultimately directly threaten the United      States.       North Korea possesses a much more advanced nuclear weapons      program than Iraq, and it has been assessed that North Korea      may already possess nuclear capability.       North Korea also has a missile delivery system, and once      the third stage of the Taepo Dong missile is completed and      operational, North Korea could strike any place in the United      States.       Also, North Korea has: expelled all international      inspectors and equipment; withdrawn from the Nuclear Non-     Proliferation Treaty; restarted its plutonium processing      plants; moved thousands of plutonium rods out of locked safe      storage back into the nuclear production line; and is      enriching uranium for nuclear weapon purposes.       The country and leadership are isolated, the economy is a      failure and even the most basic necessities of life such as      electricity, sanitation, and food are lacking. People are now      starving by the thousands.       I had the opportunity in December to helicopter to the      Demilitarized Zone, DMZ, where General LaPorte, our 4-star      general in command, pointed out North Korean troop      concentrations: 70 percent of the 1.2 million-man North      Korean army is deployed along the DMZ, with enough heavy      artillery to be able to substantially damage Seoul, killing      millions. And there are reports that nerve agents may also be      deployed along the DMZ.       Since my visit in December, the 800,000 forward-deployed      North Korean troops have been placed on high alert and are      prepared to move instantly.       North Korea, isolated with its failing economy, has clearly      placed its total focus, not on feeding its people, but in      developing its military, its missiles and its nuclear      capability, all in defiance of treaties it has signed.       I believe the blame for precipitating this crisis lies      squarely with North Korea, which clearly violated the agreed      framework by beginning the surreptitious development of      nuclear capacity.       But it also appears clear to me that the administration's      handling of events on the Korean Peninsula over the past 2      years, as well as its broader foreign policy rhetoric and      statements, have served, ironically, to fuel North Korea's      paranoia and made the situation much more difficult to      manage.       First, the administration failed to endorse President Kim      Dae Jung's ``Sunshine Policy'' when President Kim visited the      White House in March 2001. This move was perceived as a major      humiliation in South Korea, helped set the stage for the      rising tide of anti-Americanism, and was seen as a sign by      the North that the administration was intent on a policy of      isolation and confrontation.       Second, in January of 2002, the administration issued its      Nuclear Posture Review, which states that there are certain      situations in which the United States would contemplate and      perhaps engage in a first use of nuclear weapons. One of the      scenarios in this review included North Korea.       Third, in September 2002 the administration issued its      National Security Strategy, which states that the United      States reserves the right to strike preemptively, even      without an imminent threat, if the administration believes      another nation poses a threat to the United States.       And fourth, including North Korea as part of the ``axis of      evil'' in the 2002 State of the Union address, along with      statements by the President saying that he loathed Kim Jong      Il, calling him names, and saying that he deliberately      starved his own people, all helped fuel North Korea's      paranoia and belligerence.       Meanwhile, one other troubling aspect of the Korean crisis      is the growing anti-American sentiment in South Korea.       The new President, Roh Moo Hyun, won the election in an      atmosphere of anti-Americanism. And in some quarters, our      37,500 troops stationed there are increasingly unwelcome.       The anti-American sentiment has been galvanized by the      accidental deaths of two young Korean girls, run down by a      large tank-like tracked vehicle on a narrow road while the      girls were walking to a birthday party. A major outcry arose      after the two servicemen driving the vehicle were acquitted      in U.S. military court on charges of negligent homicide.       The situation on the Korean Peninsula offers no easy      solution.       So I am pleased to see that after so many weeks of refusing      to negotiate directly, the administration has now opened the      door to high level discussions. This is a welcome and      imperative change. It is the only acceptable course. And its      result may well determine the effectiveness of diplomatic      efforts in this crisis.       There must be direct and multilateral discussions between      North and South Korea, Japan, China, and Russia as well as      the United States. The solution is everyone's business and      the responsibility of the leaders of all nations.       Much of what the administration has done since September 11      to safeguard U.S. security interests has been necessary and      right. I have supported these efforts.       I believe that the administration has been correct in      identifying the threat of the proliferation of weapons of      mass destruction, especially if they fall into the hands of      terrorists, as one of the top challenges facing U.S. foreign      policy.       But in Iraq and North Korea, the administration has been      pursuing two very different, and at times contradictory,      approaches, which, in the process, has confused and angered      many of our closest friends and allies.       With Iraq, the administration is beating the drums of war.      With North Korea, it is pursuing multilateral diplomacy and a      peaceful resolution of the crisis.       But these two crises are similar in many respects, and thus      the question remains: can diplomacy be an effective tool in      this new century to stay the ambitions of those states which      seek nuclear weapons? Or is the use of force our only      recourse?       I believe that the administration's current policy towards      North Korea is more likely to produce a peaceful and      acceptable outcome than its policy towards Iraq.       If you look at the different approaches to each of these      problems alongside the administration's broader foreign      policy statements and rhetoric, it is no wonder why serious      questions about America's role in the world have been raised      both here and abroad.       The administration's emphasis on unilateral action; its      dismissal of international law, treaties, and institutions;      and its dominant focus on military power as put forward in      the Doctrine of Preemption, the rationale for unilateral      preemptive attack; the National Security Strategy, which aims      to make the United States the preponderant and      unchallengeable military power in the world; and the Nuclear      Posture Review, which states scenarios in which the United      States would engage in a first use of nuclear weapons, even      against the non-nuclear states, are particularly troubling.       Taken at face value, these positions mean the United States      holds for itself the right to strike another sovereign      nation, to wage war, if you will, even in the absence of an      immediate threat, but based solely on the perception of a      sufficient threat.       Despite administration efforts to downplay the actual      wording in these documents, they are, in my view,      unnecessarily provocative and dangerous.       I believe now, more than ever, that Teddy Roosevelt had it      right, ``walk softly and carry a big stick.''       As a presidential candidate in 2000, George W. Bush spoke      eloquently about the need for America to conduct itself with      humility in international affairs. I remember him saying      during the second Presidential debate on October 11, 2000:      ``If we're an arrogant nation, they'll resent us; if we're a      humble nation, but strong, they'll welcome us. And our nation      stands alone right now in the world in terms of power, and      that's why we've got to be humble, and yet project strength      in a way that promotes freedom.''       Yet, one of the things I have found in the trips I have      made abroad in the past year is that our allies across the      globe increasingly believe that the United States is anything      but humble.       They feel the United States does not listen to its allies,      has shown disregard for treaties and international      organizations, and has become increasingly unilateral.       As a result, we have lost much of the good will that      followed the 9/11 attacks.       The preeminent position America occupies in the world today      rests only in part on our military and economic strength.       In large part, it is also due to our moral influence and      our unquenchable quest for truth, justice, and freedom, our      belief that ``all (people) are created equal, that they are      endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights,      that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of      Happiness.''       And regardless of whether one views Iraq or North Korea as      the bigger threat, one thing they both have in common is that      the United States is much more likely to be successful in      dealing with them and safeguarding our own national security      interests if we are able to act in concert with our friends      and allies.       So we stand today at an important decision point in the      history of our Nation and the world: Will the United States      turn away from the successful bipartisan tradition of     supporting a world ordered by law, and pursue instead a      unilateralist path?       Or will we recommit our Nation to the achievement of      workable democratic structures, to law and diplomacy, and to      constructive leadership that produces coalitions to bring      about just solutions?       There may be times, when all else fails, that unilateral      American military action will be necessary, and Iraq may be a      case in point. However, in my view, that has not been      established. War must only be a last resort.       But the spirit of our foreign policy should not be the      establishment of American hegemony, any more than we would      want to see the establishment of al-Qaida's vision of a new      radical fundamentalist Islamic world.       More importantly, I strongly believe that a foreign policy      oriented towards cooperation and consultation will, in the      long run, prove to be a more effective guarantor of U.S.      national security than one of unilateralist impulse and      confrontation.                          ____________________
