Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the American people who deserve an answer about the out-of-control spending policies coming out of Washington. For the first time, the House has failed to produce a budget. There is no plan for how the majority will spend the American taxpayers' hard-earned money for fiscal year 2011.  For American families, if they don't get a budget and pay the bills, there are real consequences. Unfortunately, the majority continues to turn a blind eye to future consequences as they push spending to a record $3.8 trillion in fiscal year 2011 and widen the deficit to a record $1.5 trillion this year.  House Republicans stand ready to make tough choices in order to rein in spending. Recently, we introduced a measure on the House floor to freeze Federal civilian pay, which will save about $30 billion over 10 years. The program was selected by the American people through the innovate YouCut initiative. The American people have spoken: stop the spending frenzy, budget for the future, and return fiscal sanity to Washington.                          ____________________
