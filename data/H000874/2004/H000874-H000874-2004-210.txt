 The gentleman anticipates some of these may be introduced today. When would Members be able to have copies of these bills to review, and have these bills been reviewed by the minority on the committees of jurisdiction?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I am not privy to the work done by the relevant committees, the most relevant committees, the Committee on Resources and the Committee on Energy and Commerce, as to what they have done or not done with the minority, but as far as the gentleman's question on when Members will be able to see those bills, obviously, as soon as they are introduced, they will be available.
