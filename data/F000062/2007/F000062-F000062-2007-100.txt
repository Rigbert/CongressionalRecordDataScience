 Presdient, today I recognize Dr. Philip R. Lee, a pioneering Californian and fellow San Franciscan, who has been a dynamic leader in health policy for more than 40 years. This September, the health policy program that Dr. Lee founded 35 years ago at the University of California, San Francisco, UCSF, will be renamed the Philip R. Lee Institute for Health Policy Studies in his honor.  Dr. Lee is a giant among health professionals. His work in health care policy continues to affect how millions of Americans receive health care today. He served as Assistant Secretary for Health on two occasions; under President Johnson in the sixties and under President Clinton in the nineties. During the first 8 months of his tenure as Assistant Secretary in 1965, more than 80 landmark healthcare bills were passed including Medicare and Medicaid; health professions education assistance amendments; heart disease, cancer, and stroke amendments; the war on poverty; Job Corps; food stamps; and Head Start, to name a few.  Especially significant was Dr. Lee's work in developing policies for the newly created Medicare Program, his work to fund graduate medical education, and the work he is most proud of, the desegregation of 1,000 of the Nation's 7,000 hospitals at a time when discrimination was a real problem in the Nation.  I am proud to say that as mayor of San Francisco in 1985, I appointed Dr. Lee as the first president of the newly established health commission of the city and county of San Francisco. He was in charge of San Francisco's public health, mental health and substance abuse services, as well as San Francisco General Hospital. Dr. Lee served the health care needs of the residents of San Francisco during challenging times when the city was in the midst of the AIDS epidemic. He has served our city well.  Dr. Lee's influence also extends to health care education. As UCSF's third chancellor, he was charged with the instruction of future health care professionals and the running of a premier research university. As chancellor, he was known for his commitment to academic excellence and his efforts to stimulate minority recruitment and enrollment. When Dr. Lee founded the Institute of Health Policy Studies at UCSF, it was the first health policy unit in an academic health sciences center to bring together a multidisciplinary group of faculty to address complex health issues.  Dr. Lee's career has been devoted to improving health care and public health for all people. He has an unwavering commitment to the needs of the disadvantaged, including the elderly, the disabled, and those without access to care. Yet he is able to encourage evenhanded policy debate among parties with highly divergent views in a manner that encourages creative innovation.  He continues to be a valued teacher and mentor for many who are now in key positions as researchers, teachers, and as leaders in the health professions. It is fitting that the institute he founded three decades ago, the UCSF School of Medicine Institute for Health Policy Studies, will now be re-named the Philip R. Lee Institute for Health Policy Studies.  I wish to congratulate Dr. Lee on this tremendous honor and thank him for his service to the city of San Francisco and the State of California.                          ____________________
