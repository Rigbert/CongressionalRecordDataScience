For as long as I have known her, Rita has been a passionate, articulate, and very vocal advocate for our most needy residents. She has raised awareness that even in Vermont, there are people without a roof over their heads, and most importantly, that these people have names, and faces, and that many of them are children. They could not have a better defender. I would like to have printed in the Record the text of the Burlington Free Press article announcing the selection of Rita as Vermonter of the Year, and offer my congratulations and sincere thanks to our very own ``Saint'' Rita Markley. I ask that the article be printed in the Record.  The article reads as follows:             [From the Burlington Free Press, Jan. 1, 2000]               COTS Director Is Our Vermonter of the Year                          (By Stephen Kieman)       They are the problem the world's richest country pretends      it doesn't have. Curled up in doorways, or killing time on      street corners, they are the vision more fortunate Vermonters      have learned to look past.       In a booming economy, they are the bust. Amid records on      Wall Street, they sleep on Main Street.       They are the homeless. And Rita Markley does not look past      them. She does not pretend they do not exist. Most of all,      she does not stop believing in them.       As director of the Committee on Temporary Shelter, the      largest program for helping homeless people in Vermont,      Markley provides them with shelter, and then a way up.       For her exemplary advocacy on behalf of homeless people,      for her unstinting attention to an urgent social issue, and      for her success in building a more aware and compassionate      community, Rita Markley is The Burlington Free Press      Editorial Board's choice for Vermonter of the Year.                             a new problem       COTS began providing shelter on Christmas Eve, 1982.      Homelessness in Vermont is that recent a phenomenon. Last      year more than 4,000 Vermonters lacked housing at some point.      Most of them turned to COTS.       In 1999, COTS provided 10,723 bed nights to people who      otherwise would have slept in a car or on the street. COTS      also gave shelter to nearly 300 families--including 534      children.       Indeed one of Markley's achievements has been educating      Vermonters about who homeless people are. Granted, some are      the bothersome substance abusers who elicit little sympathy,      but that is a shrinking proportion.       Many homeless people are veterans. Many are victims of the      national trend to close mental hospitals and other      institutions, who have not subsequently received sufficient      community services.       Mostly, the homeless are people that Vermonters in good      homes interact with all the time--at restaurants, at cash      registers, in hotels. Though this work formerly paid enough      to support people, today a full-time job is no guarantee of a      place to live.       Of the families who needed COTS last year, half had at      least one person working. Yet wages at entry level jobs have      fallen so far behind the cost of living in Vermont, the      number of homeless families has quadrupled in only four      years.       Meanwhile the federal government, which used to build      affordable housing units by the tens of thousands, has      stopped. Urban renewal programs have demolished low-income      housing, worsening the supply shortage.       Housing development has focused on higher priced homes; the      state's median house selling price rose 20 percent this      decade, placing a solution farther out of reach.       The Clinton administration has responded by expanding      rental assistance money. But in Vermont, roughly 1,000 people      eligible for these funds face a major obstacle: no eligible      apartments available. Burlington has it worst, with a vacancy      rate near zero.                           More than shelter       Markley came to COTS as a part-timer who wanted to write      fiction. Now she is a full-time champion of people who      otherwise would not have a voice--or a place to go.       COTS offers much more than a meal and a bed, though. It      provides a continuum of services: health care, child care,      job training, coaching for interviews, help with school,      summer programs for children, mental health counseling, and      on and on. For those who strive, these programs are a strong      ladder into good housing and greater opportunities.       Most importantly, COTS offers its clients hope--that they      can escape dependency and attain self-sufficiency. ``Rita      believes in the resourcefulness of the human spirit,'' said      United Way executive director Gretchen Morse. ``She never      falters on that.''       It works. Seventy percent of the people who complete COTS'      training programs have a job and stable housing a year later.      A new effort to link apartment hunters with landlords who      accept federal subsidies has found 40 individuals and 60      families a place to live--even in this no-vacancy market.       COTS has therefore earned the national accolades that have      poured in from advocacy groups and the U.S. Department of      Housing.                          compassion, ability       With so serious a problem affecting so vital a need of a      population growing so quickly, you might expect their      strongest advocate to be strident or self-righteous. In      Markley's case, a better description would be jokester      chocaholic.       Yes, she is capable of speaking with passion at COTS'      annual candlelight vigil. Yes, she is articulate in the      Statehouse and before community leaders. And yes, sometimes      she is angry about Washington's indifference to the people      who are not sharing in the nation's prosperity.       But Markley uses irreverent humor to protect her from the      sometimes grimness of her task, and to thwart burnout. She is      quick to praise others, and effusive in her thanks.       As a result she has made homelessness something Vermonters      cannot ignore. Some 180 businesses support COTS financially      or with in-kind services. Some 1,500 Vermonters walk for COTS      each May. That means Markley is helping cultivate compassion      across the community, a good deed that extends far beyond the      mission of COTS.       It also means COTS has steadily diminished its reliance on      government's help, now receiving two-thirds of it's funding      from other sources. Services are not tailored to the      eligibility requirements of some grant, but to what a      homeless person actually needs.       Markley draws on a wealth of skills in her work. Sometimes      she is the passionate advocate. Sometimes she is the skilled      policy wonk. Sometimes she is the light-hearted comic who      brings chocolate to a potentially controversial meeting.       Sister Lucille Bonvouloir, a founder of COTS, tells a story      that reveals a seemingly bottomless reservoir of compassion      and ability. A woman came into COTS in the 1980's and no one      could communicate with her. Everyone wondered why the woman      would not speak. Then Markley entered the room, and in a      matter of minutes they had struck up a lively conversation.       In Russian.                          ____________________
