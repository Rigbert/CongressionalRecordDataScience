Speaker, it is with great pleasure and honor that I congratulate Mr. Jerome W. Watson on his retirement from United Steelworkers of America Local Union 1066. Jerome has spent nearly 35 years dedicating his life to the interests of Local Union 1066 as well as his community in Northwest Indiana. His career at Local 1066 has allowed him the opportunity to touch the lives of numerous people.  Jerome Watson has accomplished many visionary goals throughout his career. Before joining Local 1066, Jerome admirably served in the United States Army during the Vietnam War until his honorable discharge in 1969. He began his career at Local 1066 as a Grievance Committeeman in 1976. After being hired by United States Steel as a Motor Inspector Expanded, Jerome faithfully served Local 1066 on the Classification Committee, By-Law Committee, Institute for Career Development Local Joint Committee, Legislative Committee, and as Editor/Chair of the Banner Newspaper Committee. He was Grievance Chairman of Local 1066 from 1985-1991 and again in 1996-2003, and he served as the President from 2003-2004.  Not only has Jerome Watson had many positive accomplishments throughout his career at Local 1066, he has also actively contributed to his community through participation in various programs aimed at improving opportunities for the people of Northwest Indiana. Jerome participated in the successful negotiations that resulted in the Ivy Tech/United States Steel craft articulation agreement, which allowed graduated apprentices and trainees to obtain Associates Degrees through credit allowed for previous relevant training and additional Ivy Tech core classes. Along with his many other accomplishments, Jerome has received numerous awards and certificates, including the Q1 award for Union Involvement from Ford Motor Company, the Labor award from the A. Phillip Randolph Institute. He was honored with the awards of merit for Local Union 1066 Banner Newspaper for best local union coverage, best regular column, and best U.S.X. 1986 ``lockout coverage.'' Jerome received certificates of approval from the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, and the Ivy Tech State College program of Electrical and Mechanical Degree Program.  Jerome has demonstrated his loyalty by his outstanding service to Local 1066 and his community through his hard work and self-sacrifice. Although Jerome has served on numerous Committees and has dedicated his time to Local 1066, he has never neglected to provide support and love to his family. Jerome and his wife Linda have one son, Jerome Jr., and a daughter, Tina.  Mr. Speaker, Jerome Watson has given his time and efforts selflessly to the people of Northwest Indiana throughout his years of service. He has taught every member of Local 1066 the true meaning of service to all members of the Northwest Indiana community. I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Mr. Jerome Watson for his outstanding contributions to Indiana's First Congressional District. I am proud to commend him for his lifetime of service and dedication.                          ____________________
