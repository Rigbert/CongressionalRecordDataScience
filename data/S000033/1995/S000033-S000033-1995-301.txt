  Essentially what we are talking about tonight are priorities. That is what a government does, like every family in America. It has to make choices as to how it allocates money and where it saves money.  What the gentleman said in terms of the rescission package is basically consistent with the whole thrust of the Contract With America. What that is about, as his charts have amply demonstrated, is that on one hand, despite all of the loud rhetoric about the terrible deficit and the $4.5 trillion national debt, the first point is our Republican friends are proposing massive tax breaks for the wealthiest people in America. Here we have a situation today where the gap between the rich and the poor in America has never been wider, the wealthiest 1 percent of the population own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent. We have a terrible deficit. All kinds of very serious social needs in America. And our Republican colleagues are proposing massive tax breaks for the wealthiest people in America.  Now, that may make sense to somebody, but not to the many people in the State of Vermont and around this country that I talk to who work for a living. That is point number one.  The second point that the gentleman from California made, which is also absolutely appropriate, is that today at a time when the cold war has finally ended, when the Soviet Union is no longer our enemy, Russia wants to join in NATO, many of the Communist bloc, former Communist bloc companies want to join in NATO, at a time when we have the ability to significantly lower military spending, to help us deal with the deficit, to help us pump money into all kinds of enormous needs that this country faces, our Republican friends, if you can believe it, and I know that many people may have a hard time actually believing it, are proposing tens of billions of dollars more for the star wars program.  So tax breaks for the rich, more money for star wars, and for other military programs.  If you are going to do those things, which will cost us tens of tens of billions of dollars and if you want to move toward a balanced budget in 7 years, something has got to give. That is the equation. Tax breaks for the rich, more money for star wars. Well, what has got to give?  And the gentleman from California mentioned a number of the areas that have been affected by rescissions, that is, cutbacks in money that has already been appropriated.  Let me reiterate some of them as they apply to the State of Vermont. I was particularly outraged that one of the areas where we saw the most savage cutbacks, $1.3 billion, was for the Low Income Heating Assistance Program, also referred to as LIHEAP. The LIHEAP program provides heating assistance to low-income people, many of them elderly people who live in cold climates. In my State of Vermont, the weather gets down to 20 below zero to 30 below zero. We have many elderly people who are living on very fixed incomes. These are people who often have to choose between heating their homes or buying the prescription drugs they need to ease their pain.                              {time}  2215  The LIHEAP program impacts upon 24,000 households in the State of Vermont. The Republican rescission package would cut back 100 percent, would eliminate the LIHEAP program.  One of two things will happen as a result. Either elderly people will go cold [[Page H2980]] in Vermont and in Maine and throughout northern America, or they will take the little money they have to put into heating and not have the food that they need or the medicine that they need.  I do not know about other people's priorities, but it does not make a whole lot of sense to me to talk about spending billions of dollars more for Star Wars to cut taxes for the rich by tens of billions of dollars and then force tens and tens of thousands of elderly people in America to go cold in the wintertime.  Every politician who gets up here talks about the serious drug problems that we have. It is a problem in Vermont, it is a problem in California, it is a problem in Virginia, it is a problem all over America.  In my State of Vermont I was recently at a town meeting in Bennington and teachers there talked about how important the drug education money that comes into that community is in keeping kids away from drugs. Every sensible human being understands that an ounce of prevention is worth a lot more than spending billions of dollars throwing people into jail. People in Vermont and all over this country are working day and night to keep kids away from drugs, away from gangs.  This rescission program cuts back significantly on money that goes to help teachers and educators keep kids away from drugs. And on and on it goes, cutbacks for education, for people who are homeless.  I think what the rescission package talks about is the priorities that some of our Republican friends have, and I think that they are not the priorities that the ordinary American people have. And I hope that out of this discussion tonight people all over this country will stand up and say, now wait a second, that is not what the United States of America is supposed to be, it is not supposed to be making the elderly go cold in the wintertime, it is not supposed to be taking away educational opportunity from homeless people.  I would simply conclude my remarks by thanking the gentleman from California very much for this extremely important discussion.
