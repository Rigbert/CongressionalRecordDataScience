 On the other hand, let us be very clear that Secretary Richardson in this letter makes it very clear that he does not want any cuts in the weatherization program, and he is very strongly opposed to the matching 25 percent proposal that came out of the committee.

On the other hand, what this letter tells us is that he does not support the cuts that the committee has brought forth.
