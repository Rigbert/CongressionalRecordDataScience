 President, today I wish to honor the life of Sid McDonald of Arab, AL, who passed away on May 15, 2015. He will be remembered as a skilled businessman who was committed to bettering his community and State through public service.  Sid was born in Springfield, AL. He earned a degree from the School of Commerce and Business at the University of Alabama in 1961. However, his time at the University of Alabama goes well beyond his days as a student. He was a member of the University of Alabama board of trustees from 1992 to 2008, and served as the pro tempore of the board from 1999 to 2002.  Sid began his career in public service when he was named to the Alabama Commission on Higher Education in 1970, the year that it was created. He had a passion for education and was instrumental in establishing the Arab City School system where he became the first board chairman. Sid served the people of Marshall County in the Alabama House of Representatives for two terms and also served in the Alabama Senate from 1975 to 1979. He later served as Alabama's finance director under Governor Fob James from 1980 to 1982.  After graduating from the University of Alabama, Sid began his successful business career. He became president of Brindlee Mountain Telephone Company, which he managed until it was sold in 2000. In 1983, he founded DeltaCom, a statewide long-distance telephone company, serving as its chairman until it was sold in 1996. He was one of the first outside members of the board of directors of Intergraph Corporation from 1997 until 2006. Most recently, he led the start-up of CBX Holding, LLC (Cold Box), an Arab producer and marketer of temperaturecontrolled cargo containers. In addition to his many business adventures, he was very active in commercial and residential real estate development.  Sid's accomplishments and contributions to the State of Alabama have not gone unnoticed. He was elected in 2001 to the Alabama Academy of Honor's One Hundred Living Alabamians and was elected to the Alabama Business Hall of Fame in 2010. The University of Alabama also dedicated a facility on campus in his honor, Sid McDonald Hall.  I offer my deepest condolences to Sid's wife Jane Plunkett McDonald, and to all of their loved ones as they celebrate his many life accomplishments and mourn this great loss.                          ____________________
