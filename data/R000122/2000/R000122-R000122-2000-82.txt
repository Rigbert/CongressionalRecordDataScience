President, I rise to express my support for the conference report on H.R. 2559, the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000. This conference report has two major components: a crop insurance reform bill and a major farm relief package. I want to comment briefly on each of these.  I support the crop insurance reform bill because it will increase premium subsidies for farmers who buy more comprehensive coverage and support research of new crop insurance policies for currently non-insurable specialty crops that are important in Rhode Island and other states in the Northeast. It is an important step forward in a long-term bipartisan effort to encourage farmers across the country to obtain more crop insurance coverage and reduce income losses due to natural disasters. I was disappointed that the Senate bill's risk management pilot project was dropped in conference with the House.
