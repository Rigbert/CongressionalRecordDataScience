President, our amendment is as straightforward as it is effective. Under section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code, a small business can deduct up to $24,000 of the cost of qualifying property placed in service in any given year. The deduction is phased out for taxpayers that invest more than $200,000 per year in qualifying property. For the rest of this year and for all of next year, the Bond-Collins amendment permitted small businesses to expense up to $40,000 in new equipment purchases per year. So the limit would go from $24,000 to $40,000. It would also increase the total investment limit from $200,000 to $325,000.  The purpose of our amendment is to encourage small businesses to make important investments that create jobs. It would allow them to write off more of their new equipment purchases immediately. Many small businesses have put on hold investments in equipment that they were planning to make in the wake of the September 11 attacks and because of the poor economy. This tax incentive would help encourage them to go ahead with these critical investments.  Direct expensing allows small businesses to also avoid the complicated rules of depreciation as well as the unrealistic recovery periods for many assets. For example, under current law a computer must be depreciated over 5 years, even though we all know from the experience in our offices that the useful life of most computers is 2 to 3 years.  Our amendment would also help to address a critical need of small businesses to access more capital. As the Small Business Administration has noted:       Adequate financing for rapidly growing firms will be      America's greatest economic policy challenge for small      business in [this] century.  As our economy has slid into recession, capital has become increasingly scarce for smaller companies. Indeed, venture capital investment in the third quarter of 2001--which is the latest data available--represents a 31-percent decline from the previous quarter and a 73-percent decline from just 1 year ago. So our small businesses are having great difficulty in accessing the capital they need. Moreover, the capital gap disproportionately affects minority-owned and women-owned businesses.  By raising the section 179 expensing limit by two-thirds, our amendment will, in effect, free up more capital for small businesses to purchase more equipment. These purchases in turn will stimulate other industries that produce that new equipment.  As Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has pointed out, enacting temporary expensing provisions would have the ``most immediate impact'' on our economy of all the provisions and proposals that have been advanced. It is the right medicine and it is the right tonic for our economy today.  I have spoken with entrepreneurs in my home State of Maine about what the impact would be on their particular business if we were to increase the expensing allowance. They have told me, without exception, that our amendment is needed and that it will help to stimulate our sluggish economy. Let me give an example by quoting Terry Skillins of Skillins' Greenhouses, a fourth-generation Maine family business founded in 1885. Skillins' employs between 70 and 120 employees, depending upon the season, in its landscaping, greenhouse, and floral businesses. Terry told me that Skillins' is looking to expand but that to do so is expensive. It takes money. From tractors to conveyor belts to machines that fill flowerpots automatically, the equipment that Skillins' needs to expand is expensive. Terry says raising the small business expensing limit to $40,000 would help his company a lot.  He told me something else that I think is very important and telling. Terry said that it is very important for the increased expensing to last through next year. He told me it often takes more than 1 year for a small business to carry out an expansion plan and if the increased expensing were available for 2 years, his ability to grow his business, Skillins' Greenhouses, would be far greater.  I think we should heed Terry's advice and help our small businesses, just as they will help drive our economy back to prosperity.  We also must not lose sight of the human side to this amendment. As Mark Carpentier, the owner of a small media business in Portland, ME, recently told me, increasing the expensing limit will provide his business withmore cash, cash he could use to hire another employee, to pay his employees more, or to purchase them better health insurance--a major problem for many small businesses as premiums continue to soar.  It seems to me that a true consensus package, a package that is going to make a real difference to our economic recovery, should and must include a provision like the Bond-Collins amendment to help small businesses pull through these difficult times and to give them the boost they need so they can be, once again, the engine of our economy.  Indeed, an increase in the small business expensing limit is a provision that is common to pretty much every economic recovery package other than the one advanced by the majority leader. Increased small business expensing was included in both the economic recovery packages that passed the House, the Centrist Coalition proposal--which I, along with my colleague from Maine, with Senator Voinovich, and three of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle joined together to draft--and the Senate Finance Committee bill which was reported with unanimous Democratic support in committee.  The help that our amendment would provide comes at a relatively modest cost to the Treasury. It is needed by small businesses across the Nation. I believe it would make a real difference.  A survey by the National Federation of Independent Business, our Nation's largest small business advocacy group, showed that the September 11 attacks and the economic downturn have significantly damaged small business economic activity. According to the NFIB's members, 34 percent of those responding reported that their sales are lower since September 11; 13 percent reported that business investment plans had been postponed or canceled altogether.  The Senate, tomorrow, will have the opportunity to put the investment plans of our Nation's small businesses back on track. This is a modest step we can take, but it is a step that will make a real difference to our small businesses and to the millions of employees for whom they provide good jobs. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment which the NFIB considers to be a key one in favor of small business.  In that regard, I ask unanimous consent a letter from the NFIB, endorsing the Bond-Collins amendment, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                      NFIB Key Small-Business Vote  small business needs help now!! Vote yes on bond-collins expensing                                amendment       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 600,000 members of the      National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), I urge      you to support Senator Kit Bond's and Senator Susan Collin's      amendment increasing for two years the amount of equipment      purchases that small businesses may expense each year from      the current $24,000 to $40,000.       Many small businesses are currently struggling to cope with      the recession and the events of September 11. Increasing the      expensing limit would provide small and growing firms with      the funds to make critical investments and keep their firms      running and growing, creating new jobs.       The Bond amendment will also help small business by      eliminating burdensome record keeping involved in      depreciating equipment. And it adjusts the investment limit      on expensing from 200,000 to $325,000.       Small business is the major job generator for the economy.      Let's give them the tools to grow, hire more employees, and      lead this country out of recession. Support the Bond-Collins      expensing amendment. Votes on or related to this amendment      will be an NFIB Key Small-Business Vote for the 107th      Congress.           Sincerely,                                                   Dan Danner,                                            Senior Vice President,                                                    Public Policy.
