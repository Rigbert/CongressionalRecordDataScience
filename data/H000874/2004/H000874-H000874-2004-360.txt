 Reclaiming my time, I think we still have some work to do on that, hopefully in a bipartisan fashion. This is obviously a critical problem confronting the Congress and the American people. Hopefully, perhaps, we can reach some agreement on that. If we had some extra time, that might be possible.  Mr. DeLAY. I want to congratulate the gentleman, because I know he has worked on it and others have. I have been very pleased with the bipartisanship that has been exhibited in working on this continuity of government bill. I am very pleased that it is coming along. I think we can continue to work together and come to some sort of solution to protect this House in case of some calamity.
