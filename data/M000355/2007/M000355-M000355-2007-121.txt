 President, just briefly, a couple of other observations, I would say that I know it is the position of the Senator from New Hampshire--of course, he can speak for himself, but it is the position of the Senator from New Hampshire, myself, and many others that we make this moratorium permanent. I think that still ought to be our goal in the future.  With regard to the week that is now coming to a conclusion, I would have to state it has been quite a good week, with a number of achievements thatare important for the Senate and, in particular, the confirmation of Judge Southwick, which was not only important to the State of Mississippi but important to this institution, the Senate, in terms of how we are going to treat nominees in the future.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
