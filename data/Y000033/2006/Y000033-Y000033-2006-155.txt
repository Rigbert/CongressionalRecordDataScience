Mr. Chairman, I have the greatest respect for the gentleman who just spoke. My interest is in fact legislation on appropriation bills. And I do believe we have the opportunity to in fact have good hearings on this issue, because there is a difference of opinion.  Do me a favor, my friends, and go back and read 1972, 1973, 1974 and 1975. You were here, Mr. Obey. I believe you were. I was. Maybe you weren't.
