President, Vermont, the Green Mountain State, is filled with outdoor enthusiasts: people who ski, snowboard, mountain bike, hike, and do so much more. Outdoor enthusiasts who live in Chittenden County or who have visited the area are likely to have perused the walls, shelves, and aisles of the Skirack in Burlington, VT. Today I want to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Skirack, a small business that has become a staple of downtown Burlington.  Just a few blocks from its present location at the corner of Main and Pine Streets in downtown Burlington, the Skirack first opened its doors on November 22, 1969, driven by the vision of a group of University of Vermont students. The founders of the Skirack--Karen George, Zandy Wheeler, Spike Clayton, and John George-Wheeler--opened the shop with one goal in mind: to provide the finest outdoor goods and services. Over the next 50 years, their store has equipped Vermonters and visitors to our State with the essentials as they face the elements and reach new heights, both literal and figurative.  Vermont has a proud and prominent legacy of outdoor recreation. Vermonters, or those who visit, can cross country ski, swim in Lake Champlain, mountain bike, or go on a trek through any of Vermont's magnificent forest trails. Contrary to the store's name, the Skirack has been Vermonters' one-stop shop for all of their outdoor recreational needs, regardless of the season.  Since its inception, the Skirack has been the recipient of numerous honors and accolades. The store has been named the Snowsports Retailer of the Year and Nordic Retailer by Ski Industries of America. But recognition of the Skirack goes far beyond their snow sport inventory. For 5 years in a row, from 2013 through 2017, it was named one of America's best bike shops by the National Bicycle Dealers Association and in 2018 was named one of the 20 Best Running Shops in America by Gear Patrol.  The Skirack has gone through many changes throughout its 50 years of operation. In 1974, Karen, Zandy, Spike, and John moved the Skirack from its small shop on Center Street to where it is currently located on Main Street in downtown Burlington. Over time, they were able to double the size of their store by expanding to the building next door. Then, in May 2011, they began a special partnership with Patagonia and opened a second store, Patagonia Burlington. And today, the Skirack employs more than 80 Vermonters.  Vermont's economy depends on small businesses like the Skirack. Over the years, those small businesses have become the backbone of Vermont's economy. In 2018, the more than 77,000 small businesses made up 99 percent of Vermont businesses--99 percent. In Vermont, almost 60 percent of employees, over 158,000 Vermonters, are employed by a small business. I am proud that small businesses such as The Skirack, have not only been able to not only survive but thrive.  With the holiday season approaching, it is important for Americans across the country to visit their hometown Main Street stores as they shop for friends and family. Holiday sales represent 20 percent of average annual sales across most industries and 30 percent or more for some businesses.  Marcelle and I congratulate Karen, Zandy, Spike, and John on an incredible 50 years of operations at the Skirack. We wish them all the best of luck, and we hope for 50 more strong years.                          ____________________
