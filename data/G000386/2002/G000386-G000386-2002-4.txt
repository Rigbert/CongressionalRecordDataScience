 President, let me thank the good Senator from Montana and take a moment to echo his remarks. I strongly supported the Brownfield Revitalization Act and applaud the strides that it is making toward remediating brownfield sites across our Nation.  In Iowa, as in many other States, we are challenged with our share of brownfields in places like Des Moines, Cedar Rapids and Sioux City. The cleanup and redevelopment of brownfield sites can help reduce health risks, protect the environment, revitalize surrounding communities, preserve open space and create jobs by reintroducing properties into the stream of commerce that have languished for years.  Philosophically, I support efforts to encourage private markets to help solve problems such as those presented by our Nation's brownfield sites. Given the size and scope of the brownfield problem in this country, I believe it behooves us to look for additional, innovative and low-cost solutions to help encourage investment in the remediation and redevelopment of these sites.  I understand that current law may discourage tax-exempt investors from contributing capital to the remediation and revitalization of brownfield sites. Let me say to my good friend and colleague from Montana that I will gladly work with him to explore legislative options to help bring additional private capital to bear on solving our Nation's brownfield problem.
