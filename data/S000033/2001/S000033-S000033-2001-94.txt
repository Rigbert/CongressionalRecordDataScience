 Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Gutknecht) for yielding me the time.  Mr. Chairman, whether the idea comes from a Republican or an Independent or a Democrat, who is trying to lower the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs in this country, there goes the pharmaceutical industry again, which has spent $200 million in the last 3 years to make sure that women in this country who have breast cancer have to pay ten times more for Tamoxifen than they do in Canada. The gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Gutknecht) has a good idea. It will save substantial sums of money for millions of Americans.  I should point out, by the way, that the concept of reimportation that we are talking about today has been in existence for 25 years in Europe; and I do not know of one problem that has existed there. Let us stand up today to the pharmaceutical industry. Let us support this amendment. Let us support my amendment. Let us represent the people back home rather than the big money interests who would defeat both of these amendments.
