Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to call attention today to the great work and humanitarian achievements accomplished by Patricia Apy, who recently received the American Bar Association's 2015 Grassroots Advocacy Award.   A partner at Paras, Apy and Reiss, P.C. in Red Bank, New Jersey, Ms. Apy was selected for this extraordinary honor by the Board of Governors of the 400,000 member ABA--for her ``outstanding support of legal protection and assistance to members of the military.''   In announcing the award, the ABA noted that Ms. Apy is ``recognized as one of the nation's leading experts in family law'' who has``focused her career on the needs of military families, serving as a teacher, advocate, lecturer, consultant and commentator on the complexities of international family law.'' The ABA also cited the countless pro bono hours, Ms. Apy has dedicated on Capitol Hill and at the New Jersey state legislature. They highlighted her equally effective advocacy on behalf of victims of international parental child abduction.   I first met Patricia Apy ``Tricia'' when she was serving as the lead American attorney for David Goldman, a New Jersey resident who fought five years for the return of his son Sean who was abducted by David's ex-wife to Brazil. Tricia delivered expert advice and counsel in David's long, arduous, but ultimately successful case.   As the chairman of the subcommittee that oversees human rights, I authored legislation to help bring an end to David and Sean's nightmare and I held--and continue to hold--Congressional hearings to ensure that other Americans are spared this pain. Tricia Apy has provided comprehensive, world-class testimony and analysis on the myriad of problems left behind parents face. Her insights were key as we drafted, the Sean and David Goldman International Child Abduction and Prevention and Return Act (The Goldman Act--PL 113-150), my law to help prevent international parental child abduction and secure the return of those children who have been abducted and remain separated from their left behind parent.   At the ABA award ceremony in her honor--hosted at the U.S. Supreme Court--Patricia Apy paid special tribute to the inspiration she draws from her parents, Joseph and Gloria McHale. Having served our Nation valiantly, decorated WW II hero Joseph McHale died at a young age in a VA hospital leaving Gloria to raise three children including Tricia who was only nine at the time. She credits their love and hard work with her success and it is with great pleasure that I share with my colleagues her moving comments and acceptance speech.        Patricia Apy, American Bar Association's 2015 Grassroots      Advocacy Award Winner: ``Freedom, Justice, Liberty . . .      without Lawyers they're just words . . .'' Nearly 20 years      ago this was the theme of the American Bar Association annual      meeting. At the time, we were accused of hyperbole, I don't      believe that anyone would accuse us of hyperbole today. I am      a member of an association of 400,000 professional advocates,      to be distinguished in that number is a remarkable honor, and      I am humbled by this recognition. I wish to express my      appreciation to the Governmental Affairs Office and the Board      of Governors of the ABA.        I believe that real advocacy, is evidence of what inspires      you, the experiences you share and the opportunities you have      had. I am a person of faith, and my faith informs me that      nothing happens to us by accident. Which is why I should not      have been surprised to find myself the newest liaison to the      Standing Committee on Legal Assistance for Military Personnel      for exactly one month on September 11, 2001. On that day, I      went (as my brother Michael has coined it) from being a      ``mere lawyer'' to a ``protector of heroes''. I like that      moniker, understanding that it is one I can only aspire to.        I am so proud of the work that has been accomplished by      the LAMP committee during my tenure on it, and by my      colleagues, many of whom are in this room who have shared      that laboring oar. The LAMP committee is chaired by General      Officers, they are all spectacular lawyers and American      heroes. But the three men with whom I worked most closely,      the incomparable Gen Earl Anderson, Brig Gen David Hague and      my own ``true north'' Rear Adm. John Jenkins, former T-Jag of      the Navy, taught me so much more than how to be a great      advocate. They taught me about duty and honor, in doing so.        My opportunities for public advocacy, whether on behalf of      the United States at the Hague, or consulting with or for our      warfighters at the Pentagon, or on behalf of disenfranchised      and marginalized women at the UN and the White House, or with      my hand in the air testifying before the Congress have in      large measure been opportunities afforded me because of my      affiliation with the ABA. The people with whom I have worked,      whether in the military, diplomacy or governance have      typically devoted their personal and professional lives to      the service of their country, usually in anonymity. I don't      know why anyone would do so in this age of cynicism and      partisanship. But they do, and we should all be proud and      deeply grateful for the continued commitment to justice that      ABA has afforded.        On the wall of my home hangs the Silver Star, and two      Bronze Stars, the second with Oak leaf cluster in lieu of a      third Bronze Star. My father died in a VA hospital when I was      nine years old. I was raised and educated by the heroic      efforts my mother, Gloria McHale, in extraordinarily modest      means. It is not lost on me, how very improbable it is to be      standing here in the Supreme Court of the United States, as      the child of a deceased war veteran. I thank my husband David      Apy, my family, my law partners and longtime paralegal, and      many colleagues and friends in accepting this national      recognition. My experience, my inspiration and my faith serve      as the motivation for my advocacy.        I have closed each and every one of the over one thousand      hours of continuing legal education that I have conducted      with and for our military lawyers exactly the same way, never      wanting any of them to go into harm's way without knowing for      certain and for sure, that on behalf of my family we know      that we sleep in peace at night only, due to their service      and sacrifice. For that, and for this honor . . . I remain      profoundly grateful.                          ____________________
