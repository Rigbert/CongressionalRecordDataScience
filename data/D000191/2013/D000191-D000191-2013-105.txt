  Mr. DeFAZIO. Okay, 38th time repealing all or part of the Affordable Care Act. Now, the Republican mantra was ``Repeal and Replace,'' but somewhere along the way they forgot about the ``replace'' part. So tomorrow, total repeal.  Well, what does that mean? I've got a few concerns.  It means insurance companies can go back to rescinding, that is, taking away your policy when you get sick even if you've been paying premiums. They could do that until this law passed.  And 3.1 million young adults, 18 to 26, oops, you're off your parents' policy. Sorry. No insurance.  5.3 million seniors who got their doughnut hole reduced last year, sorry, you're back in the bill doughnut hole.  3.54 million people in private plans who got free preventative procedures last year, sorry, those aren't free anywhere.  Up to 17 million children with preexisting health conditions would again be denied coverage.  105 million people in health care plans that previously had lifetime limits, well, your lifetime limit is back.  So total repeal, no replace, doing incredible damage to seniors, children, and many other insured Americans.                          ____________________
