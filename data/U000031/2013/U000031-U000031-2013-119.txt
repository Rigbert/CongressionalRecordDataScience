Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 50th anniversary of the City of Portage, Michigan--A Natural Place to Move.  On February 18, 1963, residents of Portage Township voted 3,762 to 2,315 in favor of becoming a city. On December 31, 1963, the City of Portage was formally incorporated. From just over 20,000 residents in 1963, Portage is now home to over 46,000. Historically, Portage grew as a crossroads for traders in the 19th century and benefitted from fertile farmland and abundant natural resources.  Today, Portage is a vibrant community with affordable, safe housing in well-maintained neighborhoods; hundreds of successful commercial and industrial businesses; and is the retail crossroads of southwest Michigan. This strong, diverse community is family-focused and proudly boasts over 2,000 acres of park and recreational space, 56 miles of bikeways, three nature preserves and seven lakes that connect its citizens and visitors to each other and the natural world.  The City of Portage is a robust community that excels with an accredited public safety department, low tax rate, accredited senior citizen center, comprehensive and efficient city services, diverse employment opportunities, an excellent public school system, award-winning district library and world-class healthcare that together facilitate an economic climate that allows Portage residents to thrive. Quite simply, it is a great place to live, work, and play.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize the City of Portage and applaud the city on its 50th anniversary. A momentous milestone for a remarkable community.                          ____________________
