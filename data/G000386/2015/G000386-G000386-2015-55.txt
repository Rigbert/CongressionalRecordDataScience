 We are being accused of attacking immigrants. However, I just want to note that the Democrats take no shame in politicizing the recent gun violence and promoting legislation that would not have stopped some of the shootings, from Newtown, CT, to Roseburg, OR.  This is not a partisan issue. This bill protects law-abiding people and improves our public safety. Had it been enacted before July 1, individuals like Kate Steinle might still be with us.  I would think we should all be able to agree that people who are in the country illegally and committing crimes should not be released back into the community. There has to be accountability and a commitment to uphold the rule of law. For too long we sat by while sanctuary jurisdictions released dangerous criminals into the community to harm our citizens. It is finally time that we put an end to it, and tomorrow we will have that opportunity. It is time we work toward protecting our communities rather than continue to put them in danger.  I hope all of my colleagues will support this bill and vote to proceed to it tomorrow.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
