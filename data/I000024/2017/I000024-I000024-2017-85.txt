President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania, and the answer is, yes, I am prepared.                       Bilateral Trade Agreements  Mr. President, President Trump is meeting this weekend with Japanese Prime Minister Abe, and so I want to take this opportunity to talk about the need for bilateral trade deals.  We have heard during the campaign and since he has been elected President of the United States that Donald Trump has not been adverse to trade. He said he is for fair trade. I think that makes sense, that we should have it.  I would like to talk about some of the problems that are there that I think he can correct that had not been corrected by the previous administration.  Bilateral trade agreements with our key allies should be a priority for this Congress, and I look forward to working with the Trump administration to ensure that these agreements grow American exports, especially for our agriculture and our energy producers.  For full disclosure, I must admit that my State of Oklahoma is a major ag State and also a major energy State.  Of our many key allies, I want to highlight three opportunities for the United States to engage in bilateral trade agreements with three countries: Japan, Taiwan, and then many of the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.  Japan has the third largest economy in the world, but American farmers and ranchers are limited in their ability to access them, and this is why: They have very high tariffs on things we would want to export to Japan. At the same time, we are buying their automobiles. We are buying their products. And that is one of the typical examples of what I think our new President has been referring to. He wants to have the deals that benefit equally America and our partners. I think we can really do that.  We should engage with Japan to develop bilateral trade agreements with a focus on providing new and commercially meaningful market access for agricultural exports and smoothing the way for increased energy exports. In particular, Oklahoma beef producers are chomping at the bit to get more access to the Japanese market.  In addition to agriculture, my State is an energy State, as I mentioned, and Japan is a nation that is hungry for energy. In fact, Japan has accounted for 37 percent of global LNG purchases since 2012. LNG is liquefied natural gas. I am biased because we are a major producer in the State of Oklahoma. It is something they need, and they need to get it from someone. We ought to make this a bilateral arrangement. A trade agreement with Japan would streamline the current lengthy and pretty cumbersome process for LNG exports to Japan, ensuring that they have a reliable source of energy production and providing jobs to Oklahoma at home.  In addition to Japan, Taiwan is a close friend and ally to the United States and our ninth largest trading partner. As I happen to be the chairman of the Taiwan Caucus, I know firsthand how important it is to strengthen the U.S.-Taiwan relationship, which we can do by engaging in direct bilateral trade agreement negotiations with that country. There is no reason for us not to.  I believe that a key component of any trade agreement, including with Taiwan, is an effort to ensure that food safety and animal health regulations are aligned and based on science to ensure that any differences do not become non-tariff trade barriers. This would enable us to directly address the ban Taiwan has against U.S. pork because we use an ingredient called ractopamine in our feed to keep the hogs lean. It is perfectly safe, but Taiwan uses that as an excuse to block imports of our pork to their country. This is an issue I have already brought up with the Trump administration and with Wilbur Ross, who is waiting for confirmation as the next Secretary of Commerce. That is why we need bilateral trade agreements with Japan and Taiwan.  Our trade relations with counties in Africa are also important because, according to the Economist magazine, six of the world's fastest growing economies were in Sub-Saharan Africa from the year 2000 to 2010. For too long Sub-Saharan Africa has been ignored as a trading partner for the American Government. In fact, they pretty much have been ignored anyway.  I can remember when the continent of Africa was in three different commands. They had the Pacific Command, European Command, and Central Command. For this continent with its significance, I was somewhat instrumental in changing that, in establishing a new command, which is called the AFRICOM. The same thing has been true in terms of not using it as a trading partner.  For the last 20 years, I have been--I think I made my 144th African country visit--working with that continent, and I have seen firsthand the vast potential that is there. When they saytheir economies are growing--and a lot of times they say ``Well, we are not interested in doing that'' because they are not large enough yet.  Last year, Congress enacted my ``Africa Free Trade Initiative Act,'' which requires government agencies--the USTR, USAID, and other agencies--to collaborate on efforts to build trade-based capacity in African nations. This is a step in the right direction for America to partner with and secure deeper ties to the fastest growing economies in Sub-Saharan Africa.  While some in our government may not deem Sub-Saharan African countries ready for deeper collaborations on trade with the United States, let me tell you what is going to happen if we don't. We still have this country called China. Right now, China has become very active in Africa. What you hear in Africa is, America will tell you what you need, but China builds what you need. The problem with that is, that doesn't help Africa, and Africans know this, because China imports their own labor to build all these things.  So this is one of the things we are looking at where we can actually come out ahead if we will get in on the ground floor and get involved with these economically active countries. And we need to focus more on building trade in legal capacities so that they are ready to do trade agreements, and when that time comes, they will be doing it with us and helping their economies grow. That is what our economic assistance should be all about. They grow, and we are going to grow with them.  That is a go of what was enacted in last year's African Free Trade Initiative Act, and I will continue my work with the new administration to ensure that African nations are not left behind.  With China's rising economic might, we need to strengthen America's current relationships with some of our strongest Asian allies, such as Japan and Taiwan, with new bilateral trade agreements, and this will help counter China's growing influence if that region too.  Oklahoma farmers, ranchers, energy producers, and manufacturers need competitive access to international markets to sell Oklahoma-grown and Oklahoma-produced products. New agreements with our allies would generate more economic activity and create jobs not just in Oklahoma but throughout America.  I think this is the thing that the new administration is talking about when he says we need to have--there is no justification for arrangements where we are not able to have a comparable tariff arrangement where the countries can trade with each other, and that is what we anticipate doing.  Let me mention one other thing. I know that the Senators on the other side of the aisle are spending a lot of time blocking or trying to block the nominations by this President. Every once in a while, I have to get on the floor and remind them that it is not going to work. You know they are all going to be confirmed. The votes are there, and you can say anything you want about some of the fine people who have been nominated by this President.  I was privileged to visit with President Trump in Trump Tower before he was President. I can remember going up there to visit and seeing the people who would be advisers and the types of people he was going to be nominating, and it was very impressive. Now we have gone through a situation where the Democrats in the Senate have stalled these nominations. They stalled them longer than they have ever been stalled in the history of America, going all the way back to George Washington. All we are doing is wasting time that we could be acting productively in correcting some of the problems we have in this country.                             Overregulation  There is another issue. I was fortunate enough to spend several years as the chairman and ranking member of a committee in Congress called the Environment and Public Works Committee. It has a very large jurisdiction. It is a committee that deals with--as the title infers--environment and public works, environmental and some of the overregulation that we have had, and created real serious problems.  Also, we have been successful in passing a lot of the initiatives, such as the FAST Act. That was the largest transportation reauthorization bill since 1998. So we have done a lot of good things there.  One of the problems we have had--that we dealt with in that committee and will continue to under the chairmanship of Senator Barrasso--is doing something about the overregulation. This has been a problem, serious problem. In 2\1/2\ months between the Presidential election and Inauguration Day, the Obama administration produced over 200 rulemakings; 41 of which are considered economically significant rules, rules that would result in $100 million or more in annual costs. Over the course of his administration, President Obama added 481 economically significant regulations to the Federal registry, over 100 more than the Bush or the Clinton administration.  Regulations cost our citizens, at the current time, $1.89 trillion a year and more than 580 million hours of paperwork in order to comply with this staggering amount of rules. People don't realize the cost of rules. When they made such an effort, starting way back in 2002, to pass legislation that was aimed at trying to get into some type of an arrangement on global warming--and all of this to restrict emissions--they didn't realize at that time, until the bills got on the floor, that the cost to such cap and trade--a type of regulation--is between $300 and $400 billion a year to the American people.  Every time I see a large figure coming from Oklahoma--I get the latest figures from Oklahoma, in terms of what has happened economically in the previous year--those regulations would cost the average family who pays Federal income tax in my State of Oklahoma an addition of $3,000 a year, and by their own admission, it wouldn't accomplish anything.  I can remember as chairman of that committee, we had Lisa Jackson. Lisa Jackson was the Administrator of the EPA, the first one that President Obama had appointed. I asked her the question live on TV, in an open meeting, I said: If we were to pass, either by regulation or by legislation, the cap-and-trade legislation that they are talking about passing, and have been talking about, would this reduce CO2 emissions worldwide? Her answer: No, it wouldn't because this isn't where the problem is. If it is not going to accomplish something, even if you believe the world is coming to an end because of fossil fuels, doing something in the United States is not going to correct it. But that is the cost of rules. That is what we are looking at right now.  We went through 481 significant regulations during the Obama administration. At the last minute, after President Obama realized that Hillary Clinton was not going to win, he got involved in what we refer to as ``midnight regulations.'' He had several of these last-minute regulations he was trying to get in after the election took place--and he knew who was going to be the next President--before the next President took office. One such midnight regulation, finalized January 13, is the Environmental Protection Agency's rule entitled ``Accidental Release Prevention Requirements for Risk Management Programs Under the Clean Air Act.'' EPA states that the purpose of the updated rule ``is to improve safety in facilities that use and distribute hazardous chemicals.'' As you can imagine, environmentalists will not be happy if this rule is changed, but I argue this rule does not make facilities or surrounding communities safer. In fact, it could put them at greater risk.  There are several concerns with this rule, but the biggest one is the national security implications due to the rule's public disclosure requirements. Under this rule, facilities are required to share information on the types of chemicals stored there and the security vulnerabilities with emergency responders, and upon request, to the general public. The rule does not provide for the protection of this information from further disclosure once it is provided. It is well known that terrorists have considered attacks on chemical facilities as a way to kill citizens and cause mass destruction in our communities, and of course requiring the disclosure of this information to anyone whose asks is very reckless and impossible to understand. We can't figure out why they would do that. The terrorists would have access to the same information, which would make their job a lot easier.  Congress has passed several bills to protect just this kind of information. I was even the author of one of these bills. Under the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act of 1999, the distribution of sensitive information from chemical facilities is limited to publicly available Federal reading rooms and certain Federal, State and local officials and researchers who are then barred from further disseminating the information. This makes sense. We need local officials to know what they should do in the event there is a problem, but our enemies should not be able to get this information. It is fine, except you don't want to give it to our enemies, those who are in the terrorist community.  The new rule by the EPA does not provide any of these protections to the information now required to be shared upon request, to include audit reports, exercise schedules and summaries, emergency response details--all of which would provide those intent on criminal acts with a blueprint of facility and emergency response vulnerabilities. This is exactly what they want to perform their terrorist activities. The requirement does not make these facilities safer but actually increases the chance of harm to be done to them.  The sole reason this rule was updated by the Obama administration stems from the West, TX, chemical plant explosion of 2013. Yet this rule on accidental release prevention would do nothing to prevent another West, TX, because that explosion and fire was intentional. It was an act of arson. The Obama administration used this tragedy that took 15 lives as an excuse to make these facilities and surrounding communities less safe, and it doesn't make sense, unless you look at what else the rule does.  This rule is the first step in EPA expanding its authority under the Clean Air Act to mandate how chemicals are manufactured and used. We just passed a bill, on a bipartisan basis, that takes care of this problem. You don't have to worry about that anymore. The EPA is requiring paper, petroleum, coal, and chemical manufacturing industries to conduct safer technology and alternative analysis, STAA, as part of their process hazard analysis. In conducting this STAA, these industries must consider what they call inherently safer technologies, IST, or inherently safer designs, ISD. This sounds good, but it is something that is so ambiguous nobody knows what the real definition is.  While the rule stops short of requiring EPA's approval of these STAAs or requiring the implementation of IST and ISDs, it is only a matter of time before the environmental groups begin to litigate the issue and act as escorts to force EPA to mandate these majors. This is the proverbial camel's nose under the tent. Industry will tell you that the best time to assess inherently safer technologies and designs is during the initial design phase.  Furthermore, industries are constantly evaluating their processes and making changes at the margins based on what works best for the products and customers. Allowing the EPA to become a part of that conversation adds a third party to the question that does not care about the company, the product or the consumers. The inherent safety of a technology or design is a relative standard. What might be safer in one company or product, does not mean it is going to be safer within a process that is completely different and in a different company.  For example, it may be inherently safe to store or use less of a hazardous material, but that would likely increase the number of shutdowns and startups due to not having enough materials on hand. Research shows that the shutting down and restarting of a chemical process poses a greater risk than continuous operation would.  Additionally, you would increase deliveries and movement of hazardous material throughout the surrounding communities, shifting the risk elsewhere. How can we say definitely that is safer? As you can see, there is no definitive answer to what would be inherently safer. It is an ambiguous term. It means it is very difficult to define.  Allowing the EPA's foot in the door on this would only lead to a heavier hand mandate that would hurt industries, consumers, jobs, and ultimately the valued public. This rule is promulgated on the premise of preventing another West, TX, tragedy, but this rule does nothing to protect facilities from intentional actions of a criminal or a terrorist and in fact would actually be in a position to aid them in their quest to do us harm.  I only outlined a couple of the many concerns this rule creates. I believe we should take a look at what this actually does.  It is not just this rule. As I said, President Obama went in at the last minute and did these midnight rules. This is one of the things we can look forward to doing away with, some of the overregulation that has cost Americans so much over the last 8 years.  With that, I yield the floor.
