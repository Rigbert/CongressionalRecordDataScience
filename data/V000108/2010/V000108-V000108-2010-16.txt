Fred Halpern, Mrs. Nancy Adams, and Dr. David Gross for their many years of service and dedication to the Multiple Sclerosis Society. For their exceptional contributions to such a worthy cause, each of them were honored with the ``Different Faces of MS'' Award at the Dream for a Cure event held at Strongbow Inn in Valparaiso, Indiana, on Friday, August, 20, 2010.  Since 1960, Mr. Fred Halpern has been the owner of Albert's Jewelers, which originated in East Chicago and is now located in Schererville. It is due to Fred's warm and enthusiastic personality that Albert's Jewelers has become the success it is today. Family has always been the core of Fred's life and it is no surprise that he has shaped his business by turning customers into family friends. Multiple Sclerosis became a part of Fred's life when the love of his life, his wife Donna, was diagnosed soon after their two children, Holly and Joshua were born. Fred has an enormous sense of pride and respect for Donna's courageous struggle and has said, ``Donna has been battling this disease for forty years and has never once complained. My wife has an amazing inner-strength, she loves to laugh and everyone who meets her loves her. She inspires me to do my best everyday.'' The Multiple Sclerosis Society has become a channel for Fred and Donna to give back to others who are struggling with this disease and they have been involved with the foundation for many years. Albert's Jewelers holds an auction each year in which the proceeds go to the Multiple Sclerosis Society. Fred's business also participates in the MS walk each year. In addition, Albert's continues to concentrate on MS events throughout the area that contribute to the Multiple Sclerosis Society. For his continued passionate and enthusiastic devotion to the Multiple Sclerosis Society, Fred is to be commended.  Mrs. Nancy Adams and her husband, Russ of Valparaiso, Indiana are the proud owners of Strongbow Inn. In 1999, Nancy was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis, a prognosis that changed her life forever. After three years, Nancy was doing very well and decided that is was time to give back to the many people struggling with the disease. In 2003, Nancy rode in two bike-a-thons for Women Against Multiple Sclerosis (WAMS) and raised $20,000. She was also asked that year to host the first WAMS luncheon in Northwest Indiana. Nancy continues to donate her time and energy to the cause and has since hosted three WAMS luncheons and rode in three bike-a-thons. For Nancy, having MS is a blessing and has made her realize the importance of life. She and her beloved husband have three amazing children, Ashley, Courtney, and Matthew, with whom she has shared her journey. Nancy's lifelong commitment to the Multiple Sclerosis Society and its many members is an inspiring testament to her character.  Dr. David Gross of Schererville is an ophthalmologist and maintains three offices in Northwest Indiana. In 2002, Dr. Gross rode in his first MS bike tour at Eagle Creek and since has participated each year consecutively, making this year his 9th tour. With the help of many friends, colleagues, and family, David has been able to raise $175,000 for the Multiple Sclerosis Society.  Other than through his patients, Dr. Gross has no personal ties to MS, but he has discovered the outstanding benefits that the Multiple Sclerosis Society provides for its patients and selflessly continues to support the cause. His commitment to the Multiple Sclerosis Society can only be matched by the devotion he has to his family. David and his wife Nancy have been married for 19 years and have three beautiful daughters; Sami, Rachel, and Elly. Dr. Gross's compassion and generosity are to be admired and he is worthy of the highest praise.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating these outstanding individuals as they are honored with the ``Different Faces of MS'' Award. Through their selfless devotion and service to the Multiple Sclerosis Society, they have been able to touch the lives of countless individuals, and each recipient is truly an inspiration to us all.                          ____________________
