President, I rise to introduce the National Women's History Museum Commission Act of 2013, a bill that would create a commission to evaluate and plan the establishment of a museum dedicated to women's history in our Nation's capital city. I appreciate the co-sponsorship of Senators Milkulski, Murkowski, Klobuchar, Ayotte, Stabenow, Shaheen, Murray, Landrieu, Boxer, and Feinstein.   American women have made invaluable contributions to our country in such diverse fields as government, business, medicine, law, literature, sports, entertainment, the arts, and the military. The need for a museum recognizing the contributions of American women is long overdue.  In 1999, a Presidential commission on commemorating women in American history concluded that: ``Efforts to implement an appropriate celebration of women's history in the next millennium should include the designation of a focal point for women's history in our Nation's Capital.''  Although Congress has made commendable provisions for the National Museum for African American History and Culture, the National Law Enforcement Museum, and the National Museum of the American Indian, there is still no institution in the capital region dedicated to women's role in our country's history.  This National Women's History Museum Commission Act would be a good step toward rectifying this oversight. The legislation is very straightforward and would simply establish a commission, similar to what was done for the African American History and Culture Museum, to develop a feasible plan for the establishment of such a museum in here in Washington, D.C. However, unlike previous museum commissions, taxpayers will not shoulder the funding of this project. The proposed legislation calls for the commission to fund its own costs.  A museum dedicated to women's history would help ensure that future generations understand what we owe to the many generations of American women who have helped build, sustain, and advance our society. These key moments in history deserve a museum, which would present the stories of pioneering women like abolitionist Harriet Tubman, founder of the Girl Scouts Juliette Gordon Low, Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, astronaut Sally Ride, and Maine Senator Margaret Chase Smith.  Of special pride to the State of Maine is a legendary predecessor in the Senate seat I now hold: Margaret Chase Smith who was the first woman nominated for President of the United States by a major political party, and the first woman elected to both houses of Congress. Senator Smith began representing Maine in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1940, won election to the Senate in 1948, and enjoyed bipartisan respect over her long career for her independence, integrity, wisdom, and courage. She remains my role model and, through the example of her public service, an exemplar of the virtues that would be honored in the National Women's History Museum.  Again, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 398       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
