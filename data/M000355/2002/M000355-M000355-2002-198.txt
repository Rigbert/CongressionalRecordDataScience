 While I am pleased with the decision of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra to allow reporters from the Far Eastern Economic Review to remain in Thailand, damage to that country's reputation as a democratic enclave in a neighborhood of oppressive regimes has already been done.  The task now before the Prime Minister is to rebuild the confidence of the world's democracies--and in particular America--that he respects the rule of law and freedoms of speech and thought.  As former chairman and now ranking member of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, I have tried to encourage a variety of independent media programs throughout Southeast Asia and the former Soviet Union. In fact, I have been proud to dedicate funding to a program run by Western Kentucky University's award winning school of journalism which provides professional training to foreign journalists. I would suggest that there are some Thai government officials who would benefit from Western's tutelage on the import of a free and open press in a democracy.  I know not all Thai politicians and officials agree with Mr. Thaksin's heavy-handed approach to the media. And I know that the people of Thailand, while deeply concerned about the economy, do not want to lose the freedoms they enjoy. They are keenly aware of the plight of their more unfortunate neighbors in Burma, Cambodia, and Laos.  This brouhaha was completely unnecessary, and was pre-empted, as an editorial in the Wall Street Journal earlier this week pointed out, by Prime Minister Thaksin's ``thin skin.'' Mr. Thaksin needs to abandon his efforts to control the press and concentrate instead on leading his country. I find it hard to believe that the Prime Minister is only discovering that politics is a contact sport.  I encourage my colleagues to continue to follow events in Thailand, and I extend my appreciation to the Senator from North Carolina for speaking forcefully on this issue early this week. I add my voice to the growing chorus of concern.                          ____________________
