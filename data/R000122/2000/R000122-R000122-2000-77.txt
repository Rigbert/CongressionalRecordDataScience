President, I am delighted to welcome Father Philip Smith, the president of Providence College, our guest Chaplain.  Providence College is an extraordinary institution in my home State of Rhode Island. It is a place where many of my neighbors and friends have been educated. More than that, it has been a source of strength, purpose, and inspiration for the whole community. Father Smith is the 11th president of Providence College and has been a paramount leader both for his institution and for the State of Rhode Island.  Providence College is a Dominican college, a college committed to not only developing the minds but the character of its students. Its leader is a theologian, a scholar, and a leader in his own right. His leadership is not simply intellectual; he is a leader of integrity and of commitment.  Rhode Island is proud of Providence College, and particularly proud of the president of Providence College, Rev. Philip Smith. It was an honor to have him in the Chamber today to lead us in prayer. I thank him and I commend him. I wish him well.  I yield the floor.
