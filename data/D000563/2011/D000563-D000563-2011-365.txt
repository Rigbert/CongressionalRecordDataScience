President, I rise in strong support of the nomination of Sara Darrow to serve as a district court judge for the Central District of Illinois.  Sara Darrow is a superb nominee, and she will make an excellent addition to the Federal bench.  Her nomination is not controversial. She had her hearing before the Judiciary Committee in April and was reported out of the committee by unanimous voice vote on May 12.  Sara Darrow's name was recommended to me by a bipartisan merit selection committee that I established to consider applicants for judicial vacancies.  I was proud to recommend her name to the President last year, and I was pleased to see the President nominate her to fill the Central District judgeship that was vacated when Judge Joe Billy McDade took senior status last year.  I want to thank Chairman Pat Leahy of the Judiciary Committee for moving Ms. Darrow's nomination through the committee. I also want to thank Senator Mark Kirk for his support of this nomination.  Once the Senate confirms Sara Darrow, we will finally have a full complement of judges for the Central District of Illinois. Last year there was only one judge in this district--Chief Judge Mike McCuskey--and three judgeships were vacant.  These vacancies left the Central District in a dire situation. Cases were grinding to a halt, and Judge McCuskey had to drive all across the State to try to keep the dockets moving.  Fortunately, earlier this year the Senate confirmed Judge Jim Shadid and Judge Sue Myerscough to serve in the Central District. They are serving on the bench now.  And with Sara Darrow on the bench as well, the Central District will finally be operating at full strength. That is good news for the people who live in the 46 Illinois counties that make up the Central District.  Sara Darrow has a distinguished record, including her service as a prosecutor both at the State and Federal level.  She currently serves as an assistant U.S. attorney in the Illinois Central District, where she has worked since 2003. She works out of the Rock Island branch of the U.S. Attorney's Office.  She has investigated and prosecuted hundreds of defendants for various Federal crimes including gang offenses, drug conspiracies, gun crimes, bank robbery, money laundering, and fraud. She has also written and argued numerous appeals.  Since 2007, Ms. Darrow has served as the violent crimes chief for the U.S. Attorney's Office. She has also served as the office's project safe neighborhoods coordinator.  Before becoming a Federal prosecutor, Ms. Darrow worked in private practice in Rock Island, and she also worked as a prosecutor in the Henry County State's Attorney's Office.  She served as an assistant State's attorney in Henry County from 1999 to 2000, and then as first assistant State's attorney from 2000 to 2003.  While serving at the State's Attorney's Office she prosecuted a wide range of State felony cases. She also was responsible for supervising staff attorneys and managing the office's caseload.  Ms. Darrow enjoys an excellent reputation among the legal community in the Central District. She will serve the people of Illinois well in her new capacity as a Federal judge.  In addition to her impressive professional accomplishments, Sara Darrow is an impressive person with a wonderful family.  She is a graduate of Marquette University and Saint Louis University School of Law.  While a college student at Marquette, she interned in Washington, DC, for Senator Carl Levin. It was on Capitol Hill where Sara met and began dating her husband Clarence, who was then working for Congressman Lane Evans.  Sara and Clarence are now blessed to be the proud parents of six children: Connor, age 14; Lilia, 13; Augie, 12; Anna Grace, 10; Ella, 8; and Danny, 5.  And Sara Darrow also has an impressive record of service in the community of Rock Island, IL. She is truly a credit to this community.  In short, Ms. Darrow has the experience, qualifications and temperament to be an excellent Federal judge.  I enthusiastically support her nomination and urge my colleagues to do the same.                        nomination of gary locke
