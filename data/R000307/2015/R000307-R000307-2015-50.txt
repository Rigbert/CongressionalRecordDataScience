President. I would like to thank my distinguished colleague from South Dakota, Senator Thune, for his very comprehensive review of where we are with the economy and the need for the Keystone Pipeline to pass. As always, Senator Thune in a very articulate manner made the case for our country to become more energy independent and also touched on national security and the stagnant situation we face with our economy.  I thank the Senator for his remarks.                          ____________________
