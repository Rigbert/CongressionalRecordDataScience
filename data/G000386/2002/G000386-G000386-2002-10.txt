  In October of this year, Senator Baucus and I introduced the Reclaiming Expatriated Contracts and Profits, RECAP, Act to address the issue of inverting corporations that are awarded contracts by the Federal Government. Inverting corporations set up a folder in a foreign filing cabinet or a mail box overseas and call that their new foreign ``headquarters.'' This allows companies to escape millions of dollars of federal taxes every year. In April of this year, Senator Baucus and I introduced the Reversing the Expatriation of Profits Offshore, REPO, Act to shut down these phony corporate inversions. Today, our REPO bill has still not been enacted by the Senate.  You would think that the ``greed-grab'' of corporate inversions would satisfy most companies, but unfortunately it is not enough. After these corporations invert and save millions in taxes, they then come back into the United States to obtain juicy contracts with the Federal Government.
