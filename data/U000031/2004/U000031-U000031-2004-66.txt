Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Ms. Brittany Potts of Portage, Michigan, who won the 2004 National VFW Voice of Democracy broadcast scriptwriting contest. This great educational achievement also serves as a wonderful patriotic statement of Brittany's dedication and responsibility to our country. I am very proud to honor Brittany and her commitment to our nation's future.  Each year the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States and its Ladies Auxiliary conduct a Voice of Democracy audio/essay competition designed to give high school students the opportunity to voice their opinion on their responsibility to our country. Brittany, a sophomore at Portage Central High School, was one of 59 students, out of more than 80,000 participants, who received a national scholarship.  Brittany's insightful response of her commitment to the betterment of our great country serves as a reminder to all, of the immense power and responsibility we all have. I look forward to hearing of the great many achievements that Brittany has before her. It pleases me to honor the magnificent dedication of Brittany and to submit her script into the Record.                          ____________________
