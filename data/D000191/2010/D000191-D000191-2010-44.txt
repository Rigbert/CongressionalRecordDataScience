 The gentleman before me is extraordinary. This President has deficits totaled larger than every other President combined? No. Actually, yes, we do have a record deficit this last year. Most of it is inherited from George Bush. But it's true, now, that that's a very high year.  But George Bush is the one who doubled the national debt and did accumulate more debt than every other President before him, before the collapse of Wall Street because of the deregulatory agenda of the Bush administration and the Republican Party--every ounce of which I fought on the floor of this House--which brought America to its knees, which dissolved people's savings and 401(k)s and everything else for greedy bankers and investors and others. And the Republicans put that agenda in place when they controlled the House, the Senate, and the White House with their deregulatory approach.  So it's not even factually true. Yes, I'm very concerned about the astounding deficits, and we've got to deal with that, but George Bush doubled the debt. There is a record 1-year increase. It does not exceed even the amount of debt George Bush accumulated. He may be looking into the future, but it's not factually true.  To the gentleman before him who talked about bankrupting people because we're going to give them access to quality, affordable health care, I wish he would tell that to the woman from my district who I talked to who got cancer, had an individual policy, and guess what? She paid her premiums, and when it became time for renewal, the company said, Sorry. We don't renew policies of people who have cancer. Thank you very much for your premiums.
