Chairman, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina for yielding.  Let me say that this amendment has a direct impact on the war against terrorism. When he was testifying on the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act, Deputy Attorney General James Kolbe testified that the first material support for a terrorism case to be tried before a jury involved a group of Hezbollah operatives who had been operating a massive interstate cigarette smuggling scheme. He also testified that since that prosecution, material support charges have been used against other cigarette smuggling plots in Detroit.  From this information, it is obvious that the terrorists are using cigarette smuggling in order to help finance their activities, and that is why the amendment offered by the gentleman from North Carolina is a good amendment. It fits in with the antiterrorism tools that the PATRIOT Act reauthorizes, and I would urge its support.  I would also say that as a result of the modification that the gentleman from North Carolina has proposed, there is no longer a question of tribal sovereignty. That has been taken care of in the modification. So anybody who has read the ``Dear Colleague'' letter that was sent out earlier today, that is now out of date, and it is about as accurate as last year's calendar.
