  I have worked very closely with Secretary Donovan over the last 5 years, and I know he has the skills and experience to work with Congress on creating jobs and tackling our long-term budget challenges fairly and responsibly.  In his role as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Secretary Donovan has proven time and again that he is focused first and foremost on strengthening our middle class by expanding opportunities for families and communities.  From his work on stabilizing the housing market following the financial crisis, to reinforcing the agency's role in providing access to affordable housing and building strong, sustainable neighborhoods, to ensuring communities hit hard by natural disasters have the resources they need to get back on their feet, Secretary Donovan has been a highly effective and responsive leader and a great partner to us in Congress, Democrats and Republicans alike.  Secretary Donovan's nomination passed through the Budget Committee with bipartisan support. I am confident he will bring these strengths and many more to the OMB. His leadership will be critical, because while we have made progress on our budget challenges, there is a lot of work yet to be done.  I look forward to working with Secretary Donovan to strengthen our fiscal outlook over the long term and ensure we can make critical investments in jobs and opportunities to support our families, workers, and the economy. I know Secretary Donovan will be a great partner in addressing these challenges, and I urge my colleagues to support his nomination.  I yield the floor.
