 President, I appreciate the suggestions of my good friend from Nevada. We both share a desire to help the people of Florida who have certainly been lambasted by two horrendous hurricanes and are about to be hit by one that may be even bigger. We will work with the other side of the aisle to see the best way to accommodate the needs of our folks down in Florida.                          ____________________
