 President, this is a sad day in Chattanooga and a sad day across our country--another terrible tragedy--a mass shooting, apparently. A thorough investigation is underway.  The Senate's thoughts are with the families of the marines and our entire military community. Our thanks, as usual in these situations, goes out to the first responders and the community that mobilized so quickly.  We have two great Senators from Tennessee, who I know are mourning the events of today, and the American people will be interested in knowing as soon as possible as many facts about this horrible shooting as possible.                          ____________________
