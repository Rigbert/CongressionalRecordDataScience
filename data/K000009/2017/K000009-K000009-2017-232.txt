She told me, she said: You know, Marcy, I have to cut my pills in half. Can you help me try to find pills so that I can afford to pay for all the medicines that I need to take care of myself?  Rather than repealing, can't we find a majority of Republicans to help us, to help our citizens be able to get medicine at prices they can afford?  Why can't we have competitive bidding for pharmaceuticals? Why can't we have that? We have it for the VA. We have it for the Department of Defense. Why can't we have it for the rest of our citizenry so that we can get the best price?  But I thought: Cutting your pills in half? And so what happens to her is, if she doesn't take enough of the medicine, then she has a seizure. But she has got other things wrong with her, so she is trying to cut this pill and cut that pill. And I thought, this is crazy. This is crazy.  Can't we do better as a country than this for our people?  I have never understood why the price of pharmaceuticals has shot up so much. I can't tell you how many cases we get in our office where we have to call these companies and beg, you know, do you have some foundation where we can get a few more pills from Lilly or a few more pills from this company or that company in order to help people in our district.  It shouldn't be our job to turn into a medical dispensary because the system isn't working. There ought to be a way to take care of this.
