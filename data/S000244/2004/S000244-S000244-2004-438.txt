Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, this bill provides for a specific exemption for adulterated food, and anybody who eats meat which may have been infected with mad cow disease and comes down with the human variant of mad cow disease under this bill will have a cause of action against those who are responsible.  Secondly, if a person eats an adulterated hamburger and becomes seriously ill or perhaps dies of salmonella infection, this bill does not apply. The survivors will have a cause of action against those who provided the adulterated meat in the food chain.  What this bill does apply to is lawsuits that currently can be filed as a result of people eating too much, becoming obese and coming down with the diseases that are associated with obesity. That has nothing to do with downer cattle. It has nothing to do with mad cow disease. It merely means that people who have eaten too much cannot go back at those who have sold or provided a legal product in legal commerce.  Now, I wish that this debate would concentrate on the issues that are posed in this bill. The issue that the gentleman from New York (Mr. Ackerman) has brought up is a very serious issue, but that issue is not presented in this bill, and if the gentleman from New York would look at page 6, lines 9 through 12 inclusive of the bill as reported by the Committee on the Judiciary, he would see that exemption there plain as day.
