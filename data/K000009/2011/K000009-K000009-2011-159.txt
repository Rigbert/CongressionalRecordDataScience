Speaker, March is a month when Ukrainians worldwide pay tribute to Taras Shevchenko, whose monument here in Washington, D.C. bears testament to his prescient writings, prophetic visions for human dignity, and aspirations for the worth of each individual. It is with deepest respect for his life after purchase out of serfdom, and that of his friend Ira Aldridge, purchased out of slavery; that the very idea of liberty took flame out of the repressive conditions Of their forbears. Their lives deserve recognition and revelation, decade after decade, so the world remembers and honors those whose paths cleared the way for our own.        [From the U.S.-Ukraine Foundation Update, Mar. 8, 2011]   Honoring a Friendship Bonded in Defense of Human Rights From St.                   Petersburg, Russia to Washington, DC                        (By Robert A. McConnell)       While February is Black History Month, a month when      attention is given specifically to the contribution of Afro-     Americans to our country, our society, and culture, March is      the month that Ukrainians worldwide honor Taras Shevchenko.      For Ukrainian-Americans, both months are a time of reflection      on a very special and unique friendship between one of      Ukraine's greatest historical figures, Taras Shevchenko, and      a famously talented black American, Ira Aldridge.       Although both men died in the 1860s, one in Russia and the      other in Poland, and though both are little known to the      general public in America, both of their images are present      in the capital city of the United States. A mere two and a      half miles apart here in Washington DC stand monuments to      Taras Shevchenko and to Ira Aldridge. The first was born a      Ukrainian serf who was purchased out of bondage in order for      his immense talents to blossom; the second was born a Negro      in New York who, because of the color of his skin, had to      leave his country to find the full glory of his God-given      talent.       At the corner of 22nd and P streets in Northwest Washington      stands the figure of Taras Shevchenko, a monument to the man,      his writing, his profound commentaries on human dignity,      pleas of help for the plight of the downtrodden and his      aspirations for his country, struggling under tsarist      repression. Engraved in the granite is his hope for Ukraine:      ``When shall we get our Washington, to promulgate his new and      righteous law?'' On the other side of the city stands The Ira      Aldridge Theatre on the Howard University campus, constructed      in memory of a great thespian talent and as a symbol of      challenges overcome, paths revealed for other talents to      follow.       Portraits of both men hang in that theater, portraits      painted by Taras Shevchenko and donated to Howard University      in 1967 from the archives of the Ukrainian Academy of Arts      and Sciences in the United States.       Born a serf in Ukraine, Shevchenko was destined for a      lifetime of servitude. Yet when his owner left Ukraine for      St. Petersburg, Russia, he took the young Shevchenko along.      In St. Petersburg, Shevchenko's artistic talents were      revealed. In 1838, the city's artistic circles succeeded      in raising 2,500 rubles to purchase Shevchenko's freedom.      Once free, he became a student at the Imperial Academy of      Arts and his artwork and poetic writing flourished. His      poems glorified Ukraine and demanded freedom and justice      for all oppressed nations and classes of people.       Shevchenko returned to Ukraine in 1845 to find great      injustices. His poems criticized the tsarist regime and      chided the aristocracy's oppression of the peasants. For      these expressions, he was arrested and deported from Ukraine      to exile in a remote part of Asian Russia, incarcerated in a      military penal facility and, by the decree of the Tsar,      denied writing and drawing materials. Despite the Tsar's      orders and the incarcerations terrible cost to his health,      Shevchenko secretly composed some of his most powerful works      while imprisoned and in political exile. Moreover, at the      same time, Shevchenko's Ukrainian and Russian friends,      including Count and Countess Fyodor Tolstoy, worked to secure      his freedom again. Finally, ten years after his arrest,      Shevchenko was released. Forbidden to return to Ukraine, he      returned to St. Petersburg, where he soon met the American      Ira Aldridge.       Although Aldridge had been born in New York, as his immense      talents became apparent, he found his opportunities limited      due to the significant discrimination against blacks. He      chose to emigrate to England in 1824 and began acting in      small London theatres. Receiving notice and praise, he was      soon performing in England's finest theatres and began to      tour outside London. By 1852, Aldridge, the first black to      act in white roles in Shakespeare's plays, left for his first      European tour. Receiving acclaim everywhere he traveled, he      returned to London a theatric hero.       In 1858, Aldridge accepted an invitation from the Russian      Imperial Theatre to perform in St. Petersburg. Shevchenko      attended the opening performance and the two men were      introduced.       There are numerous letters and notes commenting upon their      meeting and friendship. One of Tolstoy's daughters,      Katherine, served as an early translator between Aldridge and      Shevchenko and wrote about the experience and their      friendship. Shevchenko attended Aldridge's performances.      Aldridge visited Shevchenko's studio and posed for the      artist. They visited one another often and spent time in the      same social circles, one that included many artists,      performers, intellectuals.       Their friendship was unique since they had in common not      only the creativity of their     personalities and their love of the arts, but their shared      experiences of social oppression and their dreams of a better      future for their people. Though free, famous, with powerful      friends, living in the world of Russian aristocracy, neither      seemed able to forget his past, the plight of his people.       Those who wrote about their friendship noted that they      often sang together. Aldridge greatly appreciated the      sorrowful and melodic Ukrainian songs that captured the      unfortunate plight of the people of Ukraine. Shevchenko, in      turn, loved the songs of the Negro South, no doubt to great      extent for the same reasons.       When Aldridge returned to England, he took with him a      portrait of Shevchenko by a Russian artist. Aldridge returned      to Russia several years later but by then Shevchenko had      passed away. Between 1861 and 1866, Aldridge made several      tours of the tsarist empire including three trips to Ukraine,      to Shevchenko's homeland, trips that had been denied to the      great poet, artist, and patriot. Ira Aldridge never returned      to the United States, however, he did live to know of      President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation and the end of      the Civil War.       Both of these men, historic giants in their artistic fields      and in their messages about the struggles of mankind for      dignity and the perseverance of individuals, died on foreign      soil far from their homelands. Aldridge's body remains in      Poland. Eventually, Shevchenko's body was returned to Ukraine      from Russia. Their unique friendship remains a story for the      ages; it is fitting that among the monuments to their lives      and contributions there are the two in Washington, DC, just      two and a half miles apart. A friendship that brought them      together thousands of miles from here, eventually finds them      in the capital of Aldridge's native land, respected and      honored, with Shevchenko's question still unanswered: when      will Ukraine get its ``new and righteous law?''                          ____________________
