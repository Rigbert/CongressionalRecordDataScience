Mr. Speaker, I want to bring the attention of my colleagues to a guest opinion that appeared in the June issue of Resource Review. It is by Jake Adams, an Inupiat Eskimo who is both a whaling captain and president of the Arctic Slope Regional Corp. He makes the important point that Alaskans are the best stewards of Alaska lands and resources, not the political leaders and activists who live here in Washington, DC. The text of his opinion follows my remarks.  Just as Eskimo self-regulation under the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission has succeeded in protecting both the Bowhead Whale and the communities that depend on the whale for subsistence, I believe that the resources of the Tongass National Forest will be best managed by the State of Alaska, as I propose in H.R. 2413. Time and time again Alaskans have proven their ability to manage their resources responsibly, an accomplishment, as Mr. Adams points out, that Washington, DC, cannot claim.  I hope that my colleagues will read the wise words of Mr. Adams.                 [From the Resource Review, June 1996]                       Alaska--A Place That Works                            (By Jacob Adams)       Compared to the rest of the nation, Alaskans enjoy a      relatively untouched, pristine environment. This fact has led      some people who have mismanaged their own environment and      communities to view Alaska as a public museum; a place they      want to control and preserve, untouched and suspended in      time.       This, of course, does not work well for those of us who      live in Alaska, have families to support, communities to      nurture and shareholders' economic interests to protect and      advance. Yet, many Alaskans often find that they are forced      to be major actors in contentious national debates over the      use of public lands and resources and, in some cases, even      their own private lands and resources.       It is a shame that many political leaders and activists who      live and work in the middle of the poverty, crime and      hopelessness of Washington, D.C.,--a city that does not      work--are determined to second-guess so much of what we      Alaskans do and aspire for.       Alaska, after all, is a place that works. We educate our      children. We meet our people's needs. We protect our fish and      wildlife. We believe in the work ethic. And we take care of      our poor and disadvantaged.       Profit is not a dirty word in Alaska. Free enterprise works      here. It is part of a proud American tradition that produces      income, jobs and tax revenue. It improves the quality of      people's lives. But, it can also be a hard task master.       Those of us who live on the North Slope have seen some      successes and a fair share of failures. One success story      that continues today is the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission      (AEWC). In the late 1970s, the International Whaling      Commission, elements of the federal government and animal      rights activists pushed hard to terminate my people's      traditional subsistence hunts for the Bowhead Whale. We      fought those efforts. We proposed a system of Eskimo ``self-     regulation'' through AEWC. Who better to protect the species      and regulate the hunt than the people whose subsistence and      culture is at stake?       We were successful. Today, the whales, our people and our      culture are thriving. And we did it by ourselves. Self-     regulation by the parties who stand to lose or gain is a      concept which should be used more by the state and federal      governments.       But, we have also seen some failures. ASRC and its      shareholders--working with the State, RDC, Arctic Power and      our Congressional Delegation, have tried very hard since 1987      to open the small, oil rich Coastal Plain area of ANWR to oil      and gas leasing. We own 92,160 acres of Coastal Plain land in      the huge 19 million acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. But      we are denied the benefits of our resources. We are      prohibited by federal law from producing and using oil or      natural gas on our privately-owned lands in ANWR at the      village of Kaktovik. Instead, the federal government's action      means that we must import fuel oil to heat village homes and      generate electricity. Yet, Kaktovik sits on the nation's best      prospect for major new oil and gas reserves.       We have been fighting this issue for nine years. We may      have to fight for nine or ten more. Lifting the Alaska oil      export ban took 22 years.       We will continue to push to open the Coastal Plain because      it is the right thing to do. Alaskans are the best stewards      of our land, our environment and our fish and wildlife      resources. We should be major participants in discussions      about our future. We do not need the failed landlords of      Washington to dictate their policies of failure to us and our      children.       My people have seen ups and we have seen downs. But we do      not dwell on short-term reverses or disappointments. In the      long run, rational thought and the laws of economics will      prevail. The fundamental changes taking place in Russia, our      neighbors to the west, were not conceivable ten years ago.       Alaskans need to have staying power. We are in this for the      long run. Jacob Adams is the President of the Arctic Slope      Regional Corporation, a member of the North Slope Borough      Assembly and a whaling captain in Barrow.
