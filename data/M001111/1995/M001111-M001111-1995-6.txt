 President, I am introducing legislation today to designate the 50-miles of the mid-Columbia River known as the Hanford Reach--the last free-flowing stretch of the river--a wild and scenic river and to improve fish and wildlife habitat downstream of the reach.  Although I have been working for less than a year with the community and members of my Hanford Reach Advisory Panel to develop a broadly-supported means of protecting the river corridor, the effort to save the reach has been underway for 30 years.  The Hanford Reach is an issue whose time has come.  While most of the Columbia River Basin was being developed during the middle of this century, the Hanford Reach and other buffer areas within the Hanford Nuclear Reservation were kept pristine, ironically, by the same veil of secrecy and security that lead to the notorious nuclear and chemical contamination of the central Hanford site. Today, these relatively undisturbed Hanford buffer areas are wild remnants of a great river and vast shrub-steppe ecosystem that have been tamed by dams, farms, and other economically important development.  As the last free-flowing stretch of the Columbia between the Canadian border and Bonneville Dam, the significance of the Hanford Reach has only recently become fully appreciated. Mile for mile, it contains some of the most productive and important fish spawning habitat in the lower 48 States. The cool, clear waters of the Columbia River that sweep through the reach have the volume and velocity to produce ideal conditions for spawning and migrating salmon. The reach produces 80 percent of the Columbia Basin's fall chinook salmon, as well as thriving runs of steelhead trout and sturgeon. It is the only truly healthy segment of the mainstem of the Columbia River.  At a time when the Pacific Northwest is struggling to restore declining salmon runs--and spending hundreds of millions annually on restoration and enhancement efforts--protecting the Hanford Reach is the most cost-effective step we can take. That is why the Northwest Power Planning Council, Trout Unlimited, conservation groups, tribes, and many other regional interests involved in the salmon controversy support designation of the reach under the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.  The reach is also rich in other natural and cultural resources. Bald eagles, wintering and migrating waterfowl, deer elk, and a diversity of other wildlife depend on the reach. It is home to dozens of rare, threatened, and endangered plants and animals, some found only in the reach.  This part of the Columbia Basin is also of great cultural importance. Native American culture thrived on the shores and islands of the reach for millennia, and there are over 150 archaeological sites in the proposed designation, some dating back more than 10,000 years. The reach's naturally-spawning salmon and cultural sites remain a vital part of the culture and religion of Native American groups in the area.  The southern shore of the reach chronicles a different kind of history: the story of the Manhattan project and defense nuclear production during the cold war. Nowhere else in the world is there a higher concentration of nuclear facilities, some of which are on the National Register of Historic Places, than along this stretch of the Columbia River.  In stark contrast to the old defense reactors is the section of the reach dominated by the White Bluffs, whose towering but fragile cliffs offer dramatic scenery and opportunities for solitude. Irrigation water flowing through unstable Ringold formation sediments has caused part of the White Bluffs to slide into the River, smothering spawning beds, reducing water quality, and even deflecting the course of the river. This constitutes one of the great threats to the reach.  The reach offers residents and visitors recreation of many types--from hunting, fishing, and hiking to kayaking, waterskiing, and birdwatching--and adds greatly to the quality of life and economy of the area.  My legislation builds on a foundation begun in the 100th Congress by Senators Dan Evans and Brock Adams, and Congressman Sid Morrison, who enacted legislation which called for a moratorium on development within the river corridor and a detailed study of policy options. Our bill implements the preferred alternative of the Hanford Reach EIS, which recommended Congress designate the reach a recreational river under the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.  With the guidance of my Hanford Reach Advisory Panel, the legislation also contains some refinements and protections. For example, the bill explicitly allows current activities, such as agriculture, power generation and transmission, and water withdrawals along the river corridor to continue. It excludes private property, which comprises only about three percent of the study area. The legislation also guarantees that local government and other local interests have a formal role in the management of the river corridor, which will come under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  The legislation also includes provisions which complement the Wild and Scenic River designation. The Secretary of Interior and relevant Federal agencies are directed to work with local and State sponsors in developing a program of education and interpretation related to the Hanford Reach. The city of Richland and area tribes, among others, have been working with the Department of Energy on a museum and regional visitor center proposal and are eager to make the natural and human history of the reach part of the project. Federal agencies should help coordinate with local sponsors on this initiative.  There is also great interest in the tri-cities, and among some government agencies, in improving the habitat value, access, and appearance of the Columbia River shoreline in the area, much of which is lined with high, steep levees that were put into place before the network of Columbia River dams controlled the flow of the River and reduced the need for such flood control structures. Migrating salmon and wildlife now face a sterile gauntlet, populated by predatory fish species, in this part of the River.  This bill directs the Army Corps of Engineers, which built, owns, and maintains the levees, to coordinate with local sponsors on demonstration projects to restore the rivershore. In the short-term, the bill directs the corps to undertake some small levee modification projects under their existing Section 1135 Project Restoration Program, assuming the local sponsors meet program requirements for planning and cost-sharing. The cities of Kennewick and Pasco, and the Port of Kennewick, have already indicated an interest and ability to pursue this course of action. In the long-term, the corps is directed to undertake a comprehensive study of the levees and determine if rivershore restoration in the area is feasible and an important Federal priority.  I am proud of the way this legislation was developed. It is the product of an open, consensus-building process that heard from virtually every interested group in the community and in the region. The bill was drafted with the assistance of a diverse panel of community leaders from local government, business, labor, and the conservation community.  I am deeply grateful to the members of my Hanford Reach Advisory Panel for their public spirited commitment of their valuable time, energy, and creativity. Sue Frost, manager of the Port of Kennewick; Chris Jensen, Pacso City Council; Joe King, Richland City Manager; Rick Leaumont with the Lower Columbia Basin Audubon Society; John Lindsay, president of TRIDEC; Kris Watkins with the Tri-Cities' Visitor and Convention Bureau; and Jim Watts with the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers did an outstanding job tackling the tough issues associated with this legislation and developing a consensus proposal.  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to enact this historic and balanced measure.                                 ______      By
