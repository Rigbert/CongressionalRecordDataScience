Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the Leader for his thoughtful response. We have a difference of view on the change that was made from the Livingston-Cardin and House-adopted ethics rules which provided for an investigation of any Member to go forward unless a majority of the committee disposed of it. That meant, as the gentleman knows, that it would have to be bipartisan, because the committee is equally divided, so we would have to have at least one other Member, assuming one party was united on either side, one other Member of the other party to join in the disposition of a case. And if that disposition did not occur, an investigation would go forward.  Unfortunately, it is our perception, I say to the gentleman, that what the Speaker, because the gentleman said the Speaker wanted to protect the Members, what the Speaker has done from our perspective and, we think, from the perspective of many is created a process where on the inaction of the committee, based upon a tie vote so that a partisan group can stop an investigation, that the investigation will thereby be dismissed. So it turned the process 180 degrees, from having a bipartisan vote to dismiss to now having a partisan vote or a bipartisan vote necessary to proceed.  We believe that undermines the protection of the institution. We believe that that was not necessary in order to protect individuals and Members, which we think is an appropriate due-process protection.                              {time}  1600  Mr. DeLAY. Will the gentleman yield?
