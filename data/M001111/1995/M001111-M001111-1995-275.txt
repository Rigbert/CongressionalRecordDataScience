 President, I have just returned from a trip through the agricultural region of my State and the farmers I represent are very worried about their own future and the future of their industry. By any measure, American farmers are one of this country's success stories. They have provided their fellow citizens with a stable food supply that is both safe and affordable. In fact, Americans pay less for food than any other industrialized nation in the world. They have also produced enough food to feed the world's hungry and are one the few sectors of our economy that has consistently registered a positive balance of trade. Their success, however, seems to get lost in the discussions here in Congress and the political rhetoric of the Nation.  I visited with farmers in Pullman, Colfax, Walla Walla, and Moses Lake and they do not feel that the rest of the country or the U.S. Congress appreciates their efforts. After reviewing the spate of proposals advanced this Congress, I am forced to agree with them. There seems to be a misconception around here that farmers are the only beneficiaries of the commodity programs. Nothing could be further from the truth. In exchange for income protection, the farmers that sign up for the program agree to accept production controls and numerous other guidelines and regulations on the operation of their farms. While these conditions were often put in place to achieve a specific public policy goal, it is important to remember that it is an additional cost to farmers and it is a cost they will not be able to recoup from the sale of their commodity.  Because wheat farmers face many difficulties in providing the rest of us with our food, it is easy to understand why almost 90 percent of them in Washington State sign up for the program. In addition to a regulatory environment that they often consider unfavorable, they face unfair trading practices by our competitors, nontariff trade barriers, escalation costs, and a price that is too low to cover their costs of production. On top of all this, weather conditions often wreak havoc on all the producers' hard work. Every economic analysis I have seen paints a very bleak picture of the future of rural America. I believe the conditions of American agriculture justify our continued support of the commodity programs, the export promotion programs, and the conservation programs.  The gloomy conditions in farm country are not the only reason to support these programs, however, and I am here talking on the floor of the Senate because I believe all Americans are well served by these programs, not just farmers. In my State, many of the jobs in urban areas depend on the exports provided by agriculture. If we, as a nation, wish to continue to guarantee that we have a stable food supply and continued economic growth in our cities, it is in our interest to continue to adequately fund this Nation's agricultural program. I know that I will have to continue to make that point in the urban areas of my State as well as here in Congress so that there will be a greater understanding of just how critical our agricultural industries are to all of us. We need to keep these things in mind as we consider the budget, the farm bill, and other legislation that impacts farmers.                          ____________________
