Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I think it is unfortunate that the gentleman from New York (Mr. Weiner) did not spend more time talking about his motion to recommit. And I can understand why he did not do it. Because it opens up two big loopholes in this bill to allow the minority of the bar that abused the class action laws to continue to be on the gravy train.  I will tell you how he proposes to do it. First of all, he changes the effective date of the bill. What the bill says is that any class action where the class has not been certified will go under the new rules.  The motion to recommit changes that. It says that the new rules become effective as of the date of enactment of the bill. And this will result in a rush to the courthouse in Madison County, Illinois and the other class action mills to get cases filed so that they will be exempt from the modest civil action court reforms that are contained in H.R. 1115.  Now, the other red herring that is in this motion to recommit is that it takes away the so-called interlocutory appeal. This has nothing to do with Enron or WorldCom or any other firm or individual that is in bankruptcy. They are already in the Federal bankruptcy court, and all civil litigation against them in State or Federal courts is stayed and the bankruptcy court decides those claims. But interlocutory appeals are not the bad things that we hear from the gentleman from New York (Mr. Weiner).  The average time to decide an appeal for all types of cases nationwide is 10.7 months. The average time for a merits ruling and class certification appeals in the Seventh Circuit, which includes Illinois, is only 3.2 months. So you are not talking about having justice be unduly delayed. These appeals are decided promptly, even in a very busy circuit. This motion is a red herring. It should be defeated.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
