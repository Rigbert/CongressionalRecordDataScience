Speaker, absolutely. I sent an offer over to the Senate 2 months ago to resolve all of the issues in the bankruptcy conference. They rejected it, but they never came back with a counterproposal of their own. So whatever we send over there, they appear not to like; but they do not have a counterproposal.  One of the things I think we are supposed to do in reconciling bills is to go back and forth until something is reached in the middle. I want to bring this matter to a head. I want to get the bankruptcy bill off the national table. I want to get Chapter 12 made better and made permanent, and I want to do it by getting H.R. 333 passed through both Houses and signed by the President of the United States. All I am doing is enlisting the gentleman's help and the help of the two other speakers to write a letter to those folks over there and tell them to be constructive, because they have not been that constructive to date.
