Mr. Speaker, on our very first day back in session, I joined with my colleague, Rep. Jim Saxton, in introducing legislation to block the implementation of the Health Care Finance Administration's (HCFA's) new Medicare reimbursement program for home health care.  This new Medicare reimbursement program, known as the ``Interim Payment System'' (IPS), is based on an incomplete and inequitable funding formula which directly jeopardizes home health care agencies and the elderly they serve in my state.  The value of home health care is obvious. All of us intuitively know that enabling our seniors to receive quality, skilled nursing care in their own homes is preferable to other, more costly, sometimes isolated, settings. Senior citizens receive the peace of mind from familiar settings and their loved ones close at hand. And the cost savings to Medicare from proper use of home health care are considerable.  The legislation we have introduced (HR 3108) corrects several flaws contained in the IPS formula and assures fair and reasonable Medicare reimbursement for quality home health care. If left unchanged, the IPS will cut Medicare reimbursement for home health care in New Jersey by $25 million in fiscal year 1998 alone. Several agencies in New Jersey could lose $2 million or more in anticipated reimbursement for homebound Medicare patients.  One of the most unfair aspects of the IPS is that it seeks to treat efficient and inefficient home health agencies alike, despite the fact that average utilization rates in New Jersey's agencies--43 visits per beneficiary served in 1996--are far lower than the national average of 74 visits that year.  Because the IPS reimbursement rates for each home health care agency are linked to earlier utilization rates and costs, agencies that were efficient and honest all along still find themselves struggling to squeeze another 12 to 15 percent reduction in aggregate reimbursement rates from already lean operations--a very tall order indeed. Meanwhile, agencies in other parts of the country with abnormally high home health costs and utilization rates are permitted to use base year utilization rates that were badly inflated in the first place. Thus, they will continue to receive high reimbursement rates because they had inflated costs in the past. The IPS, therefore, effectively punishes efficient operations and does not comprehensively address the problem in areas with inordinately high home health utilization statistics.  For example, home health agencies serving senior citizens in NJ will only receive enough funding to provide as few as 30 to 35 visits per patient. Meanwhile, agencies in other parts of the country--such as Tennessee and Louisiana--may continue providing their patients with almost triple that number of visits at twice the cost per visit. Disparities of this magnitude are inherently unreasonable and unfair, and must be corrected.  Mr. Speaker, it is a simple fact of life that the home health care industry is very time and labor intensive. There are ways to restructure an agency's operations to make care-giving more efficient, but at a certain point, one cannot go any further without impacting the quality of care the patient receives.  In Ocean County, New Jersey--which is home to the greatest concentration of senior citizens in New Jersey--home health care agencies may only receive enough resources to provide as few as 30 visits per patient. The situation in Mercer, Burlington, and Monmouth counties is much the same: all will see an arbitrary capping of reimbursement for home care visits no matter the patient's condition. If New Jersey patients require, on average, more visits per patient than Medicare will reimburse, the quality of the care they receive could be jeopardized and an agency that is forced to continue providing uncompensated care will eventually risk bankruptcy.  The IPS is troubling for another reason: as initially implemented, the IPS gives providers a perverse incentive to avoid treating critically ill, chronic, or more expensive patients. Unlike a fully implemented prospective payment system (PPS), the Interim Payment System (IPS) makes no attempt to distinguish between agencies that are simply inefficient and agencies that are treating a disproportionately sicker patient population.  Our bill mitigates the damage set in motion by the IPS and will restore at least 60% of the reimbursement cuts announced January 1, 1998. To preserve the quality of medically necessary care for our seniors, our legislation mandates two changes to the IPS.  First, our bill will allow home health care agencies to use calendar year 1994--rather than fiscal year 1994--cost data as the base year upon which visits and reimbursement rates are derived. This distinction may seem technical but it is extremely important for states like New Jersey which do not run on the same fiscal year as the federal government. The practical result of the IPS fiscal year requirement is that it forces NJ home health agencies to use earlier base year data (1993) when complying with the IPS. The older the data, the greater the gap between the IPS settings and the actual needs in 1998. Older data also glosses over the growing trend to move patients out of acute care settings and into home health care programs. The IPS program should be based on the most recent, practical, data.  The second provision contained in our bill will protect home health agencies from a hidden cut in the Medicare home health reimbursement. Under the guise of ``freezing'' certain costs and prohibiting adjustments for inflation, the IPS actually goes beyond merely capping or ``freezing'' home health cost limits--it reduces total per-patient payments, too. If left unchanged, this ``so-called'' freeze provision will not only cut the anticipated inflation costs, but go below current per-patient reimbursements as well. To address this, HR 3108 requires HCFA to factor in medical inflation in IPS calculations.  Mr. Speaker, when HCFA first announced its changes to the Medicare coverage of home health care I sent a letter signed by the entire NJ Congressional Delegation to Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, the Director of HFCA, outlining three major problems with the IPS and asking that the agency not implement its proposal until the formula was corrected. While one of our concerns has been addressed, the remaining inequities have not. I urge my colleagues to act swiftly on this legislation and move to protect homebound Medicare patients who are now at risk.                          ____________________
