Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Lorraine Clair, of Delta, OH. Lorraine passed from this life on October 12, 1999. Lorraine had been an elected official in Fulton County, Ohio since 1983, serving first on the village council, then as Vice Mayor, and was elected Mayor beginning in 1986 through her retirement in 1998.  Lorraine Clair graduated from Liberty Center High School in 1959, went on to study cosmetology at the Toledo Academy of Beauty Culture, and worked as a beautician for many years, eventually leaving her profession to be a wife and mother. Tapped to run for Delta Village Council in 1983, Lorraine entered the political area, a career she clearly enjoyed. As her daughter noted, ``After she was named Vice Mayor and then became the Mayor, she just ran from there.'' At many Fulton County events, Mayor Clair could be found trying to meet with everyone in the room, charming and gracious, chatting amiably or discussing farming, business, families, or issues of the day with ease.  Delta grew and prospered throughout Lorraine's tenure as Mayor. Under her administration a wastewater treatment plant was built, streets were resurfaced and rebuilt, three new housing subdivisions were built, and the village park was developed, including a new shelterhouse. She led the local effort to bring new industry to Delta, which now features two steel mills and the industries which contribute to the mills. Before she had to retire due to declining health, Mayor Clair had begun planning for a new 50,000 gallon water tower. Lorraine's drive as Mayor was summed up by her successor who stated, ``She cared quite a bit about the community and the overall quality of life. She was particularly concerned with youth activities and about things for our seniors to do.'' This summation is an honorable legacy for a woman who remained a lifelong resident of Fulton County, rising to lead one of its communities, and working with fellow elected officials to keep the county a viable community.  In addition to her public legacy, Lorraine Clair leaves an even greater personal one: her children Kirk, Michelle, and Melissa and six grandchildren. We express our heartfelt condolences to them, to her mother Rennetta, brothers Calvin and Tim, and sisters Lorrinda and Leann, and leave them with these words from poet Haydn Marshall, `` . . . for every joy that passes something beautiful remains.''                          ____________________
