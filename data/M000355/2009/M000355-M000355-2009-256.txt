 President, the Senate grieves the loss of one of its giants and one of our great friends. All of us were, of course, moved by the many tributes that have poured in since Senator Kennedy's passing. We will make time later in the week for Senators, including myself, to deliver tributes of our own on the Senate floor.                          ____________________
