Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the work of Pulitzer Prize winning columnist and author, George F. Will. In him, Mr. Speaker I believe we have a national treasure. Time and again by his labors at the keypad Mr. Will has shown himself to be a man of great insight and depth. I believe him to be a among that rarest of rare breeds--an original thinker. The concision and clarity with which he transforms those thoughts to the written word evidences a deep commitment on his part to understand and illuminate the human condition. His will to toil year after year so that others might not be lead astray by intellectual fads or fallacious reasoning is a model to all who would seek to shape the course of public life. Anyone willing to give his work a fair reading will find each week some troubling societal question logically explored, element by element and ultimately reduced to its essence without rancor or sentimentality.  I became a fan of George F. Will many years ago when the writer and father in him came together in a gloriously uncompartmentalized way to render an unambiguous rebuke to anyone who might doubt the quality of a life lived at less than physical perfection. With a few deft paragraphs Mr. Will wrote of his own son's enormous capacity to love and be loved. He explained that his ``Oriole fan'', despite whatever limitations Downs Syndrome had placed on him, could experience the joys and tragedies of life in the same way we all do--mostly through things as common as baseball. The boy was fully alive, fully human and perfectly formed in the image of God. It is my belief, Mr. Speaker that no writer in our land of literary greatness could deliver this urgent message with more force and grace than Mr. Will. It is clear that we are truly blessed as a nation to have him.  It is also obvious that despite the passing decades Mr. Will has not lost any of the, above-described commitment to his craft. His most recent Newsweek column is another fine example of all that is good and true about his work. And so Mr. Speaker, I enter that essay into the Record so that Mr. Will's own words can testify to the greatness of this decent, courageous and talented American.                        Fanatics for ``Choice''                          (By George F. Will)       Americans are beginning to recoil against the fanaticism      that has helped to produce this fact: more than a quarter of      all American pregnancies are ended by abortions. Abundant      media attention has been given to the extremism that has      tainted the right-to-life movement. Now events are exposing      the extraordinary moral evasions and callousness      characteristic of fanaticism, prevalent in the abortion-     rights lobby.       Begin with ``partial-birth abortions.'' Pro-abortion      extremists object to that name, preferring ``intact dilation      and evacuation,'' for the same reason the pro-abortion      movement prefers to be called ``pro-choice.'' What is      ``intact'' is a baby. During the debate that led to House      passage of a ban on partial-birth abortions, the right-to-     life movement was criticized for the sensationalism of its      print advertisements featuring a Dayton nurse's description      of such an abortion:       ``The mother was six months pregnant. The baby's heartbeat      was clearly visible on the ultrasound screen. The doctor went      in with forceps and grabbed the baby's legs and pulled them      down into the birth canal. Then he delivered the baby's body      and the arms--everything but the head. The doctor kept the      baby's head just inside the uterus. The baby's little fingers      were clasping and unclasping and his feet were kicking. Then      the doctor stuck the scissors through the back of his head,      and the baby's arms jerked out in a flinch, a startle      reaction, like a baby does when he thinks that he might fall.      The doctor opened up the scissors, stuck a high-powered      suction tube into the opening and sucked the baby's brains      out.''       To object to this as sensationalism is to say that      discomforting truths should be suppressed. But increasingly      the language of pro-abortion people betrays a flinching from      facts. In a woman's story about her chemical abortion,      published last year in Mother Jones magazine, she quotes her      doctor as saying, ``By Sunday you won't see on the monitor      what we call the heartbeat.'' ``What we call''? In partial-     birth abortions the birth is kept (just barely) partial to      preserve the legal fiction that a baby (what some pro-     abortion people call ``fetal material'') is not being killed.      An abortionist has told The New York Times that some mothers      find such abortions comforting because after the killing, the      small body can be ``dressed and held'' so the (if pro-     abortionists will pardon the expression) mother can ``say      goodbye.'' The New York Times reports, ``Most of the doctors      interviewed said they saw no moral difference between      dismembering the fetus within the uterus and partially      delivering it, intact, before killing it.'' Yes.       Opponents of a ban on partial-birth abortions say almost      all such abortions are medically necessary. However, an      abortionist at the Dayton clinic is quoted as saying 80      percent are elective. Opponents of a ban on such abortions      assert that the baby is killed before the procedure, by      the anesthesia given to the mother. (The baby ``undergoes      demise,'' in the mincing words of Kate Michelman of the      National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League.      Does Michelman says herbicides cause the crab grass in her      lawn to ``undergo demise''? Such Orwellian language is a      sure sign of squeamishness.) However, the president of the      American Society of Anesthesiologists says this      ``misinformation'' has ``absolutely no basis in scientific      fact'' and might endanger pregnant women's health by      deterring them from receiving treatment that is safe.       Opponents of a ban say there are only about 600 such      procedures a year. Let us suppose, as not everyone does, the      number 600 is accurate concerning the more than 13,000      abortions performed after 21 weeks of gestation. Still, 600      is a lot. Think of two crashes of jumbo airliners. Opponents      of the ban darkly warn that it would be the first step      toward repeal of all abortion rights. Columnist John Leo of U.S. News &      World Report says that is akin to the gun lobby's argument      that a ban on assault weapons must lead to repeal of the      Second Amendment.       In a prophecy born of hope, many pundits have been      predicting that the right-to-life ``extremists'' would      drastically divide the Republican Party. But 73 House      Democrats voted to bar partial-birth abortions; only 15      Republicans opposed the ban. If the ban survives the Senate,      President Clinton will probably veto it. The convention that      nominated him refused to allow the Democratic governor of      Pennsylvania, Bob Casey, who is pro-life, to speak. Pro-     choice speakers addressed the 1992 Republican Convention. The      two presidential candidates who hoped that a pro-choice      stance would resonate among Republicans--Gov. Pete Wilson,      Sen. Arlen Specter--have become the first two candidates to      fold their tents.       In October in The New Republic, Naomi Wolf, a feminist and      pro-choice writer, argued that by resorting to abortion      rhetoric that recognizes neither life nor death, pro-choice      people ``risk becoming precisely what our critics charge us      with being: callous, selfish and casually destructive men and      women who share a cheapened view of human life.'' Other      consequences of a ``lexicon of dehumanization'' about the      unborn are ``hardness of heart, lying and political      failure.'' Wolf said that the ``fetus means nothing'' stance      of the pro-choice movement is refuted by common current      practices of parents-to-be who have framed sonogram photos      and fetal heartbeat stethoscopes in their homes. Young      upscale adults of child-bearing age are a solidly pro-choice      demographic group. But they enjoy watching their unborn      babies on sonograms, responding to outside stimuli, and they      read ``The Well Baby Book,'' which says: ``Increasing      knowledge is increasing the awe and respect we have for the      unborn baby and is causing us to regard the unborn baby as a      real person long before birth . . .''       Wolf argued for keeping abortion legal but treating it as a      matter of moral gravity because ``grief and respect are the      proper tones for all discussions about choosing to endanger      or destroy a manifestation of life.'' This temperate judgment      drew from Jane Johnson, interim president of Planned      Parenthood, a denunciation of the ``view that there are good      and bad reasons for abortion.'' So, who now are the fanatics?                          ____________________
