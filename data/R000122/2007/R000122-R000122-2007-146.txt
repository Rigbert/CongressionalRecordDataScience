President, today I am introducing the No Child Left Inside Act of 2007, which will provide new support for environmental education in our Nation's classrooms. Given the major environmental challenges we face today, teaching our young people about their natural world should be a priority, and this legislation is an important first step.  For more than three decades, environmental education has been a growing part of effective instruction in America's schools. Responding to the need to improve student achievement and prepare students for the 21st century economy, many schools throughout the Nation now offer some form of environmental education. Mr. President, 30 million students and 1.2 million teachers annually are involved in these programs.  Yet, environmental education is facing a significant challenge. Many schools are being forced to scale back or eliminate environmental programs. Fewer and fewer students are able to take part in related classroom instruction and field investigations, however effective or popular. State and local administrators, teachers, and environmental educators point to two factors behind this recent and disturbing shift: the unintended consequences of the No Child Left Behind Act and a lack of funding for these critical programs.  The legislation that I am introducing today would address these two causes. It would provide funding to States to train their teachers in the field of environmental education, and it would provide support for outdoor environmental education programs for children and a model environmental education curriculum. The bill would also create incentives, through new funding, for states to develop environmental literacy plans to make sure students have a solid understanding of our planet and its precious natural resources. Finally, the legislation would reestablish the Office of Environmental Education within the U.S. Department of Education to oversee critical environmental education activities. This legislation has broad support among national and state environmental groups and educational groups.  The American public recognizes that the environment is already one of the dominant issues of the 21st century. In 2003, a National Science Foundation panel noted that ``in the coming decades, the public will more frequently be called upon to understand complex environmental issues, assess risk, evaluate proposed environmental plans and understand how individual decisions affect the environment at local and global scales. Creating a scientifically informed citizenry requires a concerted, systemic approach to environmental education ...'' In the private sector, business leaders also increasingly believe that an environmentally literate workforce is critical to their long-term success. They recognize that better, more efficient environmental practices improve the bottom line and help position their companies for the future.  Climate change, conservation of precious natural resources, maintaining clean air and water, and other environmental challenges are pressing and complex issues that influence human health, economic development and national security. Finding widespread agreement about the specific steps we need to take to solve these problems is difficult. Environmental education will help ensure that our Nation's children have the knowledge and skills necessary to address these critical issues. In short, the environment should be an important part of the curriculum in our schools.  I know my constituents in Rhode Island, as well as the residents of other States, want their children to be environmentally literate and have a connection with the natural world. I am proud to sponsor this important legislation. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact the No Child Left Inside Act of 2007. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a letter of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1981       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Office of Environmental Education.''.                                  ____                                         No Child Left Inside,                                                   August 1, 2007.     Hon. Jack Reed,     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, U.S.          Senate,     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC. 20510-3903       Dear Senator Reed: As members of the No Child Left Inside      Coalition, we are writing to commend you for introducing the      No Child Left Inside Act of 2007, and we offer our support      for environmental education in the reauthorization of the No      Child Left Behind Act. While we applaud the thrust of the No      Child Left Behind Act, we believe adjustments are needed to      improve environmental consciousness in schools across the      country.       Our coalition comprises over two dozen national and      regional education and environmental organizations. Together      we represent more than 7 million citizens who are passionate      about the inclusion of environmental education in students'      learning.       The country is facing a host of complicated environmental      challenges, but we are not providing an adequate      environmental education to our young people. Indeed, over the      past few years many schools have cut back on instruction      related to the environment, canceling field trips and      meaningful outdoor explorations. Three decades of growth in      environmental education has been hampered by No Child Left      Behind, even as the nation's environmental issues have grown      increasingly complex.       We believe it is critical to reverse this trend and provide      children with a solid understanding of the planet and the      problems it faces. As they will be called upon throughout      their lives to sort out various environmental claims and      issues impacting their jobs, health, security and      transportation, our children need to have the tools to be      able to make wise decisions and choices.       To that end, we support several changes to the No Child      Left Behind Act that would emphasize the importance of      environmental education:       New funding should be available to help states develop      rigorous environmental education standards and improve      teacher training.       To be eligible for new environmental education funding,      states would be required to develop plans to ensure that      their students are environmentally literate.       These changes will provide the incentives and support      school systems need to offer more and better environmental      instruction. The rewards are likely to be great. We know from      past research that students who take part in environmental      education programs become more engaged with school and do      better on standardized tests.       Our coalition urges that the reauthorization of the No      Child Left Behind Act not only improve educational offerings      but provide new support for environmental education.       Once again, we thank you for your leadership on this      important issue.
