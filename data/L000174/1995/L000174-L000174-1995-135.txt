President, I rise to pay tribute to a great American, Lt. Gen. William M. Keys, who recently retired from the U.S. Marine Corps. General Keys was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal in recognition of his exceptional service during the last few years of his long career. From the jungles of Vietnam to the sands of Kuwait, General Keys answered the call to duty, and today, on behalf of all Senators, I pause to thank him.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of his award citation be printed in the Record.  The text of the citation follows: Citation To Accompany the Award of the Defense Distinguished Service                         Medal to William M. Keys       Lieutenant General William M. Keys, United States Marine      Corps, distinguished himself by exceptionally distinguished      service as Commander, United States Marine Forces, Atlantic,      from June 1991 to July 1994. General Keys displayed dynamic      leadership, doctrinal and operational boldness, and dogged      determination in aggressively pursuing initiatives that      enhanced the Force's ability to successfully prevail on the      joint battlefield. He significantly improved the Commanders-     in-Chiefs ability to best utilize the operational      capabilities of all the forces available. With the      establishment of the United States Atlantic Command (USACOM)      as the joint force integrator for CONUS-based forces, General      Keys' leadership was crucial in shaping and defining many      joint warfare concepts, including the standardized      development of the Joint Air Force Component Commander      (JFACC) concept within USACOM and United States Pacific      Command. As Joint Task Force Commander for Ocean Venture 92,      he built upon improved communications capabilities and better      joint tactics, techniques, and procedures within the JFACC/     JTCB. He also played a key role in the development of joint      training concepts and exercise schedules currently emerging      from USACOM. The distinctive accomplishments of General Keys      culminate a distinguished career in the service of his      country and reflect great credit upon himself, the United      States Marine Corps, and the Department of Defense.                          ____________________
