Speaker, I would say to the gentleman, I would be delighted to appear before the gentleman's subcommittee. I thought it was very curious that when we were holding hearings on the WIC Program the gentleman did not appear before our committee, when 180,000 women were cut from the program by the gentleman's party.  Mr. McINNIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to note that yesterday the Committee on Rules heard testimony from three Democrats who are in support of the automatic continuing resolution, talking about an amendment. One of them spoke very eloquently, I thought, on its effectiveness at the State level, and we should keep that in mind.  Second of all, I think the key issue here is to get assistance to the women and children that need it, and not spend our very valuable time on this House floor arguing about the pride of authorship, which is exactly what I think has occurred on the other side of the aisle. I think it is best to step over that, and let us discuss the rule and let us pass the rule.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Foley].
