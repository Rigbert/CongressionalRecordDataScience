  As I understood what he said, he said there is a waiver in the amendment. Well, indeed there is a waiver in the amendment. It is on page 12 of the amendment. It begins on line 12. I would like to read it:       The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of      Agriculture and the Secretary of Energy, may waive the      requirements of paragraph (2) in whole or in part on petition      by 1 or more States by reducing the national quantity of      renewable fuel required under paragraph (2)--       based on a determination by the Administrator, after public      notice and opportunity for comment, that implementation of      the requirement would severely harm the economy or      environment of a State, a region, or the United States; or       [secondly,] based on a determination by the Administrator,      after public notice and opportunity for comment, that there      is an inadequate domestic supply or distribution capacity to      meet the requirement.  There is no waiver if you can meet the clean air standards without a renewable fuel such as ethanol. There is no waiver in this amendment for that. And if you are so sure of the ground you stand on, why, for Heaven's sake, wouldn't you allow a waiver if we can demonstrate--this is a rhetorical question--if we can demonstrate to the EPA Administrator that, yes, California, through its formula, can reformulate gasoline to meet the Clean Air Act without either a 2 percent oxygenate requirement or a renewable fuel to the extent that we have here?  Also, since you are on the floor, I just want you to see what you are pressing upon California. As shown on this chart, this is the amount of ethanol we would have to use, and this is the amount of ethanol your amendment forces us to use.
