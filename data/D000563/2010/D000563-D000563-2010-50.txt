President, I thank my colleague and friend, Senator Menendez, for that great speech. I know it was heartfelt. I thank him for waiting late this evening to come and those who have joined us because they understand that though the hour is late, our time is short before we cast this historic vote.  As I mentioned earlier, as I called my colleagues today, some of whom are on the fence, not sure, they said: I toss and turn thinking about this. I hope they toss and turn all night tonight and wake up tomorrow with a smile and determination on their face to do something right for America, to make sure they will have a good night's sleep Saturday night because they have been able to fulfill the dreams of so many young people who are counting on them tomorrow to rise above their political fears and to really join ranks with so many in this Chamber who, through its history, have shown uncommon political courage in moving this Nation forward in the name of freedom and justice.
