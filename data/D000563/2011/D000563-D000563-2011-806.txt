It couldn't come at a worse time, in light of our recession and unemployment. But it is important for us to put into perspective where we are and how we should resolve this issue.  When we look at the entire known reserves of oil and gas in the world--in the entire world--the United States has 3 percent--3 percent--and each year the United States consumes 25 percent of the energy that is used in the world. So when I hear my colleagues on the other side come to the floor and say we can drill our way out of this, I say to them: That is unrealistic and doesn't reflect the reality of what we face today.  Yes, we should have responsible drilling for oil and gas. We should be sensitive to the environment to avoid the kind of hazards and accidents we saw in the Gulf of Mexico, to protect that part of America and part of the world we believe should be preserved for future generations. But the notion if we could start drilling more our problems would go away is not only naive, it is wrong--flatout wrong.  We heard the chants of ``drill, baby, drill'' a year and a half ago in the course of a Presidential campaign. It is not the answer to America's energy policy, ever. We still import $1 billion worth of oil a day into the United States. It is an indication of our dependence on foreign oil that any interruption in the Middle East or from other sources is going to raise our prices.  What should we do about it? Several things. First, on the immediate agenda, we should look at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
