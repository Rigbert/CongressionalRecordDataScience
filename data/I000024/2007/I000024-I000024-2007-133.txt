Mr. President, I say to the Senator, I do not think adequate time has been given to the amendment you want to address, the Boxer amendment, and if you would want some of my time to do that, I would be willing to give it up. I am really prepared to yield back at the appropriate time on this amendment.  Let me make this comment. If people are concerned my amendment is going to be devastating, just keep in mind we have this limitation. There is a very sizable mandate that is out there. The very maximum that would be used would be to reduce that mandate--in a year when a disaster occurs--by only 15 percent. In other words, 85 percent of that mandate would still be in effect. I think that is a very reasonable approach to it.  With that, Mr. President, I will yield the floor.
