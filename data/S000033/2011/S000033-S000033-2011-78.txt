 Forty Vermont middle schools and 16 Vermont high schools sent teams to the day-long event, a cooking competition which promotes local agriculture and healthy choices in school nutrition. I was very impressed, when I attended the competition, to see the creativity and energy the students brought to this endeavor.  Vermont's Junior Iron Chef Competition brings aspiring chefs together for a timed ``cook-off.'' Middle schools face off in one division and high schools in another. Each team is composed of up to five students and is accompanied by an adult supervisor who is allowed to offer guidance but not take part in the actual cooking.  Contestants must use their culinary skills to create original school lunch dishes using at least five ingredients produced by local farmers. Prizes were awarded in three categories. I would like to recognize the winners from each category and commend the students from all competing schools for their excellent effort. Teams from Twin Valley swept the Best in Show prizes; Team Murdock winning at the middle school level and Hakuna Matata for high school. The Barre City Chefs of Barre City Elementary Middle School won the award for Most Creative Dish for middle schools and the Food Fighters from Centerpoint School won in the high school category. The awards for Greatest Number and Best Use of Local Ingredients went to the Barretown Bobcats of Barre Town Middle School and the Rebel Chefs from South Burlington High School.  In addition to extending education beyond the traditional classroom, I admire the competition for promoting local agriculture and healthy eating choices. Junior Iron Chef attempts to change the often stale homogeneity of school lunches by bolstering what is now a statewide effort, led by groups like Vermont Food Education Every Day, FEED, and the Burlington School Food Project. It attempts, successfully, to reconnect young Vermonters with our state's agricultural roots and to restore a bond between our schools and the food that Vermont produces.  Vermont is, I believe, among the leaders in promoting small scale agriculture. While Vermont has long been known for its dairy farms, smaller scale agriculture is growing rapidly in our State.  Scientific studies have shown that the health of Americans is threatened by an overdependence on fast food, on sugar-enhanced drinks, on snacks low in nutrition and high in fats. Too often we, adults and children alike, turn to processed fast foods instead of eating nutritionally balanced meals. Our national diet is, unfortunately, responsible for many unhealthy results, including a surge in both childhood obesity and childhood diabetes. Creative efforts like Vermont's Junior Iron Chef Competition are terribly important in the effort to effectively combat unhealthy diets and the rise of childhood obesity and childhood diabetes.  To the Junior Iron Chef Competition sponsors, Vermont's agriculture community and its forward thinking school systems, to those who organized the event, to the adult supervisors, and especially to the Vermont students who participated in the Junior Iron Chef Competition, let me offer my congratulations.                          ____________________
