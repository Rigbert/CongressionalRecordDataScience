Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I already thanked my colleagues, but I also want to thank some staff, particularly some of the staff on my side of the aisle. The staff on both sides worked hard: Alex Burkett; Rachel Carr; Kathy Dedrick; Janet Erickson; David Napoliello; Luke Strimer; Mike Tien; in Rick Larsen's office, Alexandra Menardy; and special thanks, because they don't get thanked enough around here, to the people who put together legislation that actually works and do yeoman's work behind the scenes, legislative counsel Karen Anderson, Rosemary Gallagher, and Stephen Hagenbuch.  Again, this is a good bill. It shows what we can do here when we drop our partisan cloaks and work together for the good of the American people, both the flying public and the businesses that are dependent upon the aviation industry, and, also, the work we did in here on disaster mitigation, things that should have been done earlier, couldn't get done earlier.  But in a must-pass bill like this, we were able to come to consensus. This is a good day for the House of Representatives--unfortunately, a somewhat rare day.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
