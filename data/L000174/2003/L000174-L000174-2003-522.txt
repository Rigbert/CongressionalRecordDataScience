We seem to have a number of clocks facing different places.  I tell the distinguished occupant of the chair that I have been around here long enough to recall a time when we were going to end at a certain time in a very late session, and the time stood still. We were very close to finishing. I think the time we had to finish was at midnight. I remember the clock getting all the way up there to 3 minutesto midnight. For the next hour, the clock was there at 3 minutes to midnight. Suddenly we worked out the last thing, the clock magically sprung forward--not totally magically, somebody pulled it forward. We were at midnight and, with a sigh of relief, we went out. Now I believe we are at the time.  I yield the floor.
