 President, I find myself in agreement with the Senator from Maine. I don't understand why we are getting into this issue at this place and time. I see no evidence of anything improper in this body. To a great extent what I see happening is legislation being developed in reaction to things that have happened in the other body, not in this body. I have been very proud of this body because we have been able to conduct our business in a very respectful manner. If there is evidence in this body of any improper and unreasonable payment to which the Senator seemed to allude, I ask him, please, bring it to the Rules Committee. I can assure him we will hold a hearing, if necessary. We will pass legislation. But at this time, what we are trying to do is coalesce around a 90-to-8 vote that took place early last year, that passed almost unanimously a bill out of this Senate dealing with earmarks, dealing with lobbying reform, dealing with ethics reform.  We are trying to keep extraneous matters, to the extent that we can, out of this bill.  With that in mind, I move to table Vitter amendment No. 5 and ask for the yeas and nays.
