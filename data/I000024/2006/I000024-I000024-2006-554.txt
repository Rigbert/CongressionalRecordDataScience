President, on February 2, 2006, I was absent for the rollcall vote on the motion to waive the Congressional Budget Act on Conrad amendment No. 2729 to Senate amendment 2702 to H.R. 4297, Tax Relief Extension Reconciliation Act of 2005. My absence was due to a previously scheduled speaking engagement at the Africa Dinner in conjunction with the National Prayer Breakfast. Had I been present, I would have voted nay on the motion to waive. Additionally, I would like to note that this absence did not affect the final outcome of the vote.                          ____________________
