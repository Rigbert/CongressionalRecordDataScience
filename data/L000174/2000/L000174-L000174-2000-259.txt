President, I am pleased to introduce the legislation to improve the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, NICS. The NICS Partnership Act authorizes the Department of Justice to reimburse states for serving as points of contact under the NICS. Our legislation also requires the Attorney General to issue a report to Congress on the appropriate formula to reimburse states for their reasonable costs to serve as points of contact for access to the NICS. I am pleased that Senators Hatch, Robb, Durbin, Kohl, Schumer, and Cleland are original cosponsors of this bipartisan bill.  The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1994 established the NICS and required federal firearm licensees to conduct a background check on thepurchaser of any firearm sale after November 30, 1998. In its first 18 months of operation, the NICS has been a highly effective system for keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and children. Having processed 10 million inquires during this time, the NICS has ensured the timely transfer of firearms to law-abiding citizens, while denying transfers to more than 179,000 felons, fugitives and other prohibited persons. That is a remarkable record in preventing crime and protecting public safety.  This success, however, has come at an unfair cost to many states. The NICS is mandated by Federal law, the Brady Act, but many states are picking up the tab for conducting effective Brady background checks. Congress should remedy this inequity. Effective Brady background checks are the responsibility of the Federal government under Federal law. As a result, it is only fair for Congress to reimburse states for their reasonable costs needed to conduct effective Brady background checks.  Because more comprehensive criminal history records are currently available at the state and local level in many states, instead of the Federal level, these states have elected to serve as points of contact (POCs) to access the NICS. A state POC is a state agency that agrees to conduct Brady background checks, including NICS checks, on prospective gun buyers. In states that have agreed to serve as POCs, federal firearm licensees contact the state POC for a Brady background check rather than contacting the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). These POC background checks review more records of people in prohibited categories, such as people who have been involuntarily committed to a mental institution or are under a domestic violence restraining order.  Indeed, in my home state of Vermont, for example, which serves as a POC, approximately 28 percent of all denials of prohibited persons seeking firearm purchases are based on state charges which would not have been available for review at the FBI's criminal record repository. These purchasers were denied because a relief from abuse order had been issued against them, they had been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of family violence, they were wanted in the State of Vermont, or they had been convicted of a felony in Vermont and not fingerprinted. These results demonstrate the value of having the states act as POCs for NICS.  Currently, the following 15 states serve as a full POC for NICS: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont and Virginia. Another 11 states serve as partial POCs for NICS by performing checks for handgun purchases while the FBI processes checks for long gun purchases: Iowa, Michigan, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Indiana, Maryland, New Hampshire, Oregon, Washington, and Wisconsin. Thus, more than half the states serve as full or partial POCs under the NICS.  In fact, of the 8,621,000 background checks conducted last year, 4,538,000 were handled by the FBI and 4,083,000--almost half--were handled by state POCs. So while some states relied on the FBI to conduct Brady background checks and paid nothing, the states that elected to conduct more effective background checks paid the full cost of them. That is unfair to states that are doing the right thing.  The State of Vermont, for instance, pays about $110,000 a year for its POC system to run effective Brady background checks on all firearms purchased through federal firearms licensees. In other POC states, the burden is higher on state legislatures to come up with funding sources to pay for effective Brady background checks.  Indeed, the Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, wrote to me last year in strong support of Federal funding to pay for the costs of Brady background checks performed by POC states. Governor Bush empathized that Florida's POC background checks were more efficient and effective than background checks performed at the Federal level. Governor Bush concluded in his letter that: ``Without this funding, it is unlikely that state legislatures will continue the state programs--the inequities of charging for the service in some states but getting free service in others are too obvious.'' I agree. I ask unanimous consent that Governor Bush's letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  The FBI, in its first operations report on the NICS, recommend that states should be compensated for their costs necessary to serve as POCs. Specifically, the FBI's report found: ``Based on its first year of operation, it is clear that the ability of the NICS to stop prohibited persons from acquiring firearms would be improved by . . . a means to help states with the cost of performing as a POC state. . . .''  A recent General Accounting Office report on the implementation of the NICS also praised the POC state background check system. The GAO report found: ``According to the FBI, the functioning of the NICS would be more effective and efficient if more states were full participants. For instance, FBI officials noted that state law enforcement agencies have access to more current criminal history records and more data sources, particularly regarding noncriminal disqualifiers, such as mental hospital commitments, from their own states than does the FBI, and have a better understanding of their own state laws and disqualifying factors.''  Similar legislation to reimburse POC states under the NICS was part of the Senate-passed Juvenile Justice bill, which has been languishing in conference for many months. I prefer that we address this issue as part of the juvenile justice legislation by convening the juvenile justice conference and finishing the work we started last May when the Senate passed the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill by a strong bipartisan vote. But since the congressional leadership appears unlikely to reconvene the juvenile justice conference, then we should consider these improvements to the NICS now to protect public safety.  Indeed, the Department of Justice, in comments on the Senate-passed juvenile justice bill, stated: ``Reimbursing the point-of-contact states for doing NICS checks could be critical to retaining their participation, because they have a strong disincentive to preform checks that the FBI is providing to gun dealers and buyers free of charge. We believe it is very important to retain point-of-contact states and increase their number, because states have access to state records that are not available to the FBI and states have the expertise to interpret their own records and local laws.''  Mr. President, states are doing the right thing by serving as points of contact under the NICS for more effective background checks, which are mandated by Federal law. These background checks prevent crime and promote the public safety. Congress should do the right thing by reimbursing these states for their reasonable costs for conducting these point of conduct background checks.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2769       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``NICS Partnership Act of      2000''.     SEC. 2. NATIONAL INSTANT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM                    IMPROVEMENTS.
