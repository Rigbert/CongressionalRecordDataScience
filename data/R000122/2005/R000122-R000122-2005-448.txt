President, may I say how proud I am of Bishop Wolf, not only for her prayer but for her extraordinary service to the people of the Rhode Island diocese. Bishop Wolf is a remarkable person, a remarkable pastor but also a remarkable individual. Unlike many people who would be content with the trappings of their ecclesiastical office, she actually has lived with the homeless in New York, Rhode Island, and Philadelphia. She endured what they endured, she saw their suffering. She bore witness to their suffering not only in her experiences but her work in Rhode Island. She is a remarkable woman who leads by example literally and constantly reminds us of our obligations not just to ourselves but to our neighbors. We are very proud to have her as our Episcopal bishop.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
