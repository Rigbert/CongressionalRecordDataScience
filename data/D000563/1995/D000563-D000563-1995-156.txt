Unfortunately, the Department of Agriculture, with reduced status, fewer functions, fewer employees, is spread all over the D.C. area. We are paying rent. Unfortunately, we are paying too much for that rent. We went through this battle last year and said there has got to be a better way.  It turns out if we build the building and occupy   it and depreciate it, it is cheaper for taxpayers. It is not just a matter of building a building. It is a matter of getting out of expensive leased space to do it.  The reason I asked the gentleman these questions is my first reaction when I heard about a new building was the same as his, for goodness sakes, at this time, this is the wrong place and time to do it.  Yet I went down there and took a look at the south building.
