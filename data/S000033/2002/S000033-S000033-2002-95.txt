 Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel) for yielding me the time.  The question we are debating today could not be simpler. In a time of a $6 trillion national debt and a growing deficit, a recession and a war, do we provide hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the wealthiest 1 percent of the population, people with a minimum income of $375,000 a year, and in the process raid the Social Security Trust Fund and endanger that system? Further, do we cut back on Medicare and other important needs in order tomake the richest people in this country even richer?  Mr. Speaker, the answer is pretty obvious. According to an L.A. Times poll published yesterday, 81 percent of the American people think that the President's tax breaks should not go through if it means taking money out of Social Security; 81 percent of the American people believe that. I believe that, and I hope the United States Congress has the guts to stand up to the wealthy campaign contributors and believe it also.
