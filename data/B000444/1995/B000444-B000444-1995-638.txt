 One of our senior Republican colleagues was very blunt about this issue. He said, along with former Senator Tsongas of the Concord Coalition, who came in to testify, the following:  That if you take Social Security out of the mix here and set it aside so it is not covered by a constitutional amendment, we are not likely to do anything to fix it.  What they mean by ``fix it'' is change Social Security; that is, either raise the retirement age, cut the benefits or increase the taxes, because everybody knows that by the time--I am 52--by the time it comes time for me to collect Social Security, there are not going to be enough of your children and my children to pay for my Social Security benefits. So something is going to have to be done.  Unrelated to the balanced budget amendment and the impact of the Reid amendment on the balanced budget amendment or the impact of the balanced budget amendment on Social Security, unrelated to the balanced budget amendment, just Social Security all by itself, does the Senator from South Carolina see any way in which Social Security can be protected from significant change if, in fact, it is included as part of the balanced budget amendment?
