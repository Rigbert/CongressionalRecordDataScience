Speaker, I am, as the gentleman knows, one of those Democrats that voted for a balanced budget amendment, voted for the Stenholm budget, voted for the coalition balanced budget amendment which gets us to the balanced budget by 2002 and, in fact, cuts more money, as my colleague knows, faster than the Republican alternative.  Having said that, I do not believe this is a responsible thing for us to do, to put at risk the credit of the United States when we clearly know we do not have agreement between the President and ourselves. However, we do have agreement on getting to a balanced budget by the President and ourselves. Once we pass the appropriation bills, we will do that.                              {time}  1300
