Speaker, the Republican leadership has turned what should have been a bipartisan achievement into a partisan travesty. When we passed this legislation by a vote of 418-8 on July 11, we explicitly barred the privatization of air traffic controllers. We did so because we were concerned about the safety of the American public. The Senate bill which passed 94-0 went even further. It extended the protection to airway system specialists. Why? On behalf of the safety of the American public.  Then the Republican leadership hijacked this legislation. It adopted a conference report that rejected the opinion of the House and rejected the opinion of the Senate and stripped out the language barring privatization, again, passed to protect the safety of the American flying public.  Instead, it allowed 69 air traffic control towers to be turned over to private companies which must always put the bottom line first, and it removed the protections for airway systems specialists, removed mandatory and terrorism training for flight attendants, and permitted foreign airlines to raid U.S. markets.  Even Republicans balked at these changes, and that is why this legislation has hung around for so long, but Mr. Speaker, without the explicit prohibition on privatization that was included in the bill we passed in June, the administration is free to move forward with privatization, notwithstanding the will of the House and the will of the Senate. That should not be acceptable in a democratic legislative body. The flying public deserves better. America deserves better. They need to know that the people on the ground responsible for air safety are not being forced to cut corners to save dollars.  I urge my colleagues to vote for a fair process and vote for the public safety by voting down this legislation and this conference report. I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.
