President, I think it is very obvious what is going on here. It has been 23 years since we have had a chance to vote on it. It probably will be the last time most Members--maybe all of the Members in this Chamber--will have a chance to vote to make English the national language.  Those who are offering this amendment today don't want English to be the national language.
