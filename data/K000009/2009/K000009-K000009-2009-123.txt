Herring, who served as the first female law director for the city of Toledo. Mayor Carleton Finkbeiner appointed Mrs. Herring law director in August 1999, after 4 months as acting law director. She retired as law director in December 2005, as the administration of Mayor Jack Ford was drawing to a close. As Mayor Finkbeiner said to the Blade, ``If you're going to be a first-rate city in this country, you have to have leaders that come from every sector of the community.'' Mr. Finkbeiner said at her appointment, ``Barb is going to be a very strong law director and a strong component to the leadership of the city.''  Most of her tenure was in the succeeding administration, and ``I was honored to serve with her,'' Mayor Ford said to the Blade. ``She was the best director I had. [She] helped draft the ethics statement we all lived under during the 4 years I was mayor. She helped set the tone.''  One issue in which she played a big part was the city's smoking ban, which preceded the statewide ban by several years. On other issues as well, ``in those days, Toledo was setting the tone for the State as far as home-rule rights,'' Mayor Ford said. ``She wrestled through a big case in the [Ohio] Court of Appeals with respect to [off-campus] student housing. I had full confidence in her. She was ethically driven. Early on, we had an understanding that we would do things by the book and do it right and not try to be politically cute.''  While she was honored to be chosen as the first woman to serve as law director, her husband, David, said, ``she was more concerned about being considered the best law director. She built that department up and was so aggressively fighting for them and trying to do things to get new talent in there,'' he said to the Blade. She had a calming effect, even in demanding circumstances, said Kelly Bejaige, who was her secretary. ``She was very dignified and caring, and that carried her through,'' Ms. Bejaige said. ``She had great respect from many people. She saw the best in everybody, and she tried to bring that out in people. She was no nonsense. She expected a lot, but nothing less than she was willing to give herself.''  Mrs. Herring was a partner in the law firm of Cooper, Straub, Walinski & Cramer in 1991 when then-law director for the city of Toledo Keith Wilkowski hired her as a staff attorney. She later became the city's general counsel. She joined the law firm after graduating cum laude in 1984 from the University of Toledo law school.  Mrs. Herring taught English and psychology about 8 years at Springfield High School near Toledo, Ohio. Before that, she taught about 6 years at Springfield Junior High. ``She wasreally the consummate teacher, and education lost what a real teacher should do,'' her husband said. ``She cared not just for the mental and scholastic side of the students, but she cared about their personal welfare.''  Born in Denver, Colorado, Mrs. Herring was a teenager when she moved with her family to Sylvania Township, near Toledo, Ohio. She was a 1963 graduate of Sylvania High School and received a bachelor's degree from Ohio State University. She was a trustee of the Toledo Legal Aid Society and was a former president of Ohio Municipal Attorneys. In retirement, she was on the board of St. Paul's Community Center. She took part in the Lucas County Juvenile Court's Court Appointed Special Advocate program. She was a lector at Blessed Sacrament Church. Surviving are her husband, David, whom she married May 21, 1966; sons, David and Nathan; brother, John White; sister, Carole Gildemeister, and five grandchildren.  It is with the deepest admiration that I pay tribute to the exemplary life of a pioneering woman. She dedicated her life in service to her family, friends, her students and the city of Toledo. May her family be comforted by the memories they hold and may Barbara Herring be blessed with a loving peace.                          ____________________
