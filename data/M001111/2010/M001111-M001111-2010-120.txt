 The managers do have a managers' package; they are going to clear it tonight.  Tomorrow morning after the Senate convenes at 9:30 a.m., we are slated to complete action on Job 1, so Senators should expect up to two rollcall votes at that time.  As a reminder to all Senators, at 2 p.m. tomorrow there is going to be a live quorum so that we can receive the House managers with respect to the impeachment proceedings. Therefore, all Members are urged to be in the Chamber at 2 p.m. so that proceedings can be expedited.  I yield the floor.                           Amendment No. 3456
