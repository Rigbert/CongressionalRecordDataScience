Speaker, while America was celebrating Martin Luther King Day yesterday and the long weekend, officials over at the White House and here in the Nation's Capitol buildings were running around frantically trying to figure out how to bail out Mexico with your taxpayer dollars, without calling it a bailout. They say ``It won't cost us a penny because Mexico will pay it all back.''  However, Mexico has never pad back its debts. That is why it is in the fix it is today. The powers that be here in Washington, therefore, have devised a multibillion dollar taxpayer bailout plan to prop up Mexico after the recent peso meltdown.  Listen to this. It will conveniently be placed off budget, through some fancy manipulations of lawyer's words that will make it sound like our taxpayer's don't end up holding the bag. First, there was an $18 billion loan package with a $9 billion line of credit from the U.S. Treasury and our Federal Reserve.  You know what the Federal Reserve is. When you put money in your local bank, it then goes up in the chain and the local banks end up owning the district banks which then own the Federal Reserve, so it is your money to begin with.  But that was not enough of our taxpayer's money last week, so now we are being asked to put up an additional, are you ready, $40 billion, that is with a B, dollars in loan guarantees in Mexico. But of course we are being told it is just a safety net and we will probably never really have to pay it, because surely Mexico will not have any problems paying off these new loans.  This is really getting interesting. How ironic that during the very month when Congress is about to consider a balanced budget amendment to put our taxpayers in a vice, we are being asked to close our eyes to this unprecedented back door version of foreign aid that holds the potential to bust any budget that we pass here. Off budget? Off budget means the bill will be on your budget, that taxpayers' budget. Don't you just love it?
