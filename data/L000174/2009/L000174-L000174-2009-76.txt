It is not the description I would have of Judge Andre Davis of Maryland. I will, in a moment, go to that.  But, first, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that upon confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 185, the Senate remain in executive session and vote immediately on confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 471, the nomination of Charlene Edwards Honeywell to be U.S. district judge for the Middle District of Florida; that upon confirmation, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; no further motions be in order, and any statements relating to the nomination be printed in the Record; the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session.
