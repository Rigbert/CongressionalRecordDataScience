Our staffs have been working for the past few months on this issue. The compromise we have reached would continue the FEMA program in the islands for the next 5 years, as recommended by the Energy Committee. In addition, the Secretary of State would be directed to immediately undertake negotiations, in consultation with FEMA, with the governments of the FSM and RMI regarding disaster assistance. Finally, if an agreement is not concluded and legislation is not enacted which reflects the new agreement within 5 years, then the administration's revised disaster assistance proposal would go into effect.
