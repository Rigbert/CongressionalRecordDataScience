Mr. Chairman, earlier today I was given the opportunity to speak in this debate about why I felt so strongly we need to lift the arms embargo. I think it is immoral. It continues to be unethical. People are being killed and slaughtered.  Under the right of one's country, a sovereign right, to defend themselves, it is my strongly held view, and thanks to the majority of this Chamber, both sides of the aisle, that we ought to lift the arms embargo. It was improperly imposed. It ought to be lifted immediately so the Bosnians can defend themselves.                              {time}  1500  But I would like to take just a moment or two to read a letter that was sent on July 31 to myself and the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Hoyer], who has been a real strong advocate and a leader on this lifting of the arms embargo. It is from Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, a man who has appeared before the Helsinki Commission, which I chair, and the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Hoyer] used to chair, is now ranking Democrat on that Commission, and time and time again he has made an impassioned plea over the years for lifting the arms embargo as a way of this country, this important country, to defend itself, but also so that the diplomacy would work. Absent a credible counterweight to the armed aggression by the Serbs, the Bosnian Serbs, the diplomacy will not work, and I would like to read the letter from Dr. Silajdzic, the Prime Minister, to Mr. Hoyer and me:                                    Republika Bosna I Hercegovina,                                 Office of the Prime Minister,                                                    July 31, 1995.     Hon. Christopher Smith,     Hon. Steny Hoyer,     U.S. House of Representatives.       Dear Congressmen: As you are aware, the people of my      country have been under the most brutal assault seen in      Europe since World War II. Throughout this conflict, we have      never asked for American or foreign ground troops to fight      for us. We do not need them. We have both the manpower and      the will to fight for ourselves. Nor have we asked for      training for our soldiers in weaponry or fighting. Our      officers are already well trained, and our rank-and-file      soldiers have had three years of on-the-job training in      addition to their service in the former Yugoslav army.      Instead, we have asked only that the arms embargo against our      country be ended.       In spite of the passage of the Hoyer amendment last month,      this embargo remains in place. In the eight weeks since that      vote, the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina has      deteriorated dramatically. The countries that created and      committed themselves to protect the six United Nations-     designated ``safe areas'' have betrayed two of them--     Srebrenica and Zepa--by allowing them to be overrun by      Serbian forces. During and after these attacks, hundreds of      civilians were raped and tortured. Thousands were massacred.      At least seven thousand are unaccounted for. Tens of      thousands more were displaced, and, in the absence of any      real response from the international community, hundreds of      thousands of our citizens throughout Bosnia are now more      gravely imperiled than before. Time is of the essence.       With their latest pledge to defend Gorazde and interminable      deliberations over whether to honor their existing      commitments to protect the three other remaining ``safe      areas,'' Contact Group and UN-troop contributing nations      claim to have drawn a line in the sand. The London Conference      countries made their pledge ten days ago, yet still there has      been no action. And it increasingly appears that the line was      drawn to protect only Gorazde--if that.       Why only Gorazde? Why not Zepa? Its 20,000 inhabitants,      even as they were still clinging to life and defending the      enclave against all odds, were written off in the London      conference communique in the name of consultations and      consensus. Why not Bihac, which Serbian forces are trying to      overrun even now? Why not Sarajevo, where Serbian forces have      escalated their criminal strangulation and shelling attacks,      and where, last week alone, 45 civilians--including 5      children--were killed, and 184 more wounded.       How do you explain to the Bosnian people that the very      governments that created and promised to protect these      enclaves are now sacrificing them? Serbian forces have      crossed every line that the international community has ever      drawn. After only a few more summits, commitments, pledges to      act, and consultations, there could be no more Bosnians left      in Bosnia.       Since before the very first attacks on our population more      than three years ago, we have been prepared to fight to      defend ourselves. Tragically, the arms embargo against our      country has ensured that this conflict be a slaughter rather      than a war.       The arms embargo must be terminated and a balance of power      be effected on the ground. Only then will this genocidal      spiral end. The recent offer of Croatian Serb forces to      retreat from Bihac back into Croatia rather than face      approaching Croatian Army units amply demonstrates the Serbs'      responsiveness to a credible threat of force rather than      empty diplomacy.       Our Army and even ordinary citizens are determined to      provide that threat and fight for their lives, homes,      villages, and country. This is our right. It is one that the      American people--and their leaders--would undoubtedly demand      for themselves if faced with brutal aggression of the type      that Bosnia is enduring.       On behalf of our people, I appeal to the American      government, the American people, and their elected      representatives to untie our hands and to prove, once again,      why American is the leader of the democratic world. In the      name of morality, lift the arms embargo.           Sincerely,                                                  Haris Silajdzic,                                                   Prime Minister.  I urge all Members to vote to endorse the amendment that has been offered to the bill by Mr. Dole, and please lift this arms embargo so people can defend themselves.  Ms. McKINNEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California [Mr. Berman].
