Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the Catholic War Veterans, Holy Cross Post 417 in Trenton, NJ on the 50th anniversary of their founding.  Mr. Speaker, in the fall of 1945, shortly after the surrender of Japan, the young men of Holy Cross Parish, like young men all across the country including my dad who was a combat veteran in the South Pacific began returning from the Armed Forces. At a young age they had stood up to aggression and prevailed. Now they were home, and anxious to get on with their lives that had been interrupted by tyranny. Monsignor Francis Kasprowicz, pastor of Holy Cross Parish took a great interest and concern for the young veterans. So he granted permission to have a Catholic War Veterans Post formed in the Parish. This interest in our returning servicemen led to the founding of Catholic War Veterans, Holy Cross Post 417.  Over the years, Post 417 has opened membership to all those who served in the Armed Forces during World War II, the Korean and Vietnam wars, and beyond. During those years they have been honored for having the largest membership of any post in New Jersey. Others have fallen by the roadside, but Post 417 continues to serve the veterans, not only in Holy Cross Parish, but in all of Mercer County, NJ.  That service is found in the Post Catholic Action and Americanism programs which are year round efforts. Post 417's Palm Sunday Breakfast, Wafer Supper, Fifth Sunday Corporate Communions, Memorial Day Mass, Veterans and Pearl Harbor Day Services are annual events. A Christmas party and an Easter egg hunt are also held yearly for the children of members of the Post as well as the children of auxiliary members.  The Welfare Program also plays an important role in Holy Cross Post 417. Members give of their time to visit disabled veterans at the VA home in Menlo Park, NJ. Often they will play bingo and provide refreshments during their visits with the veterans. The Post holds an annual Cross of Peace collection and they send cards to sick veterans.  The Post organized a Ladies Auxiliary in 1949. They have grown to become not only the largest auxiliary in the State, but also the largest auxiliary in the Nation. The members of Post 417 are well aware that their programs would not be possible without the assistance of their impressive auxiliary.  Mr. Speaker, many influential voices on the American scene today are of the opinion that the United States' greatest ailment is not a lack of wealth, or opportunity. Rather, they see a breakdown in the communal bonds that give people a sense of belonging in an otherwise uncertain and often hostile world. Few would argue with these voices that a sense of community is essential to a cohesive society. Obviously the family must provide the primary bulwark--grounding the individual with a sense that they are not alone in the world. But it is difficult for the family alone to enrich life with the kind of meaning and fraternity we all crave. Certainly careers and Government services can not fill the void either. It is precisely organizations such as Catholic War Veteran, Holy Cross Post 417 which best link us all with the larger community that exists beyond our homes and individual lives.  Post 417, by their long record of involvement in our community is a model of exactly the type of organization which brings us all together in a stable and free society. The service and fellowship they provide to each other, as well as numerous other veterans of our Nation's armed conflicts, certainly yield countless benefits to us all as members of the human family and residents of central New Jersey. We are all truly blessed for their 50 years of service to, as their motto proclaims, God, Country, and Home.  Catholic War Veterans, Holy Cross Post 417, I salute you and all your members both living and deceased on your first half-century of service and wish you the best of success for the many, many years your future surely holds.                          ____________________
