Section 1343 already encompasses frauds effected by the interstate or foreign transmission of wire communications involving, among other things, writings, signs, or signals and, consequently, would encompass frauds effected by means of computers in interstate or foreign commerce. I know the Justice Department already interprets 1343 in this way. I too would urge the Justice Department to ensure that Federal prosecutors in the field are familiar with the scope of criminal conduct, including fraud effected by means of computers, encompassed by the wire fraud statute.  Regarding the new requirement that the Sentencing Commission report on the criminal misuse of encryption technologies. I caution that the results of this report--whatever they may be--will be necessarily incomplete and should not be viewed out of context. Instances in which encryption technologies have been used to thwart the theft of valuable computerized data, which has been encrypted, and to prevent crimes, such as economic espionage, do not usually draw the attention of law enforcement and therefore will not be included in the report.
