Speaker, I doubt there is a single member of this House  or the Senate who has never set foot inside the Monocle on D Street. Just steps from the Capitol, the Monocle has been a political institution as much as it has been a warm and welcoming restaurant. Its tables have long been set with a spirit of friendship that transcends party; they have been host to meetings and discussions on nearly every issue of national importance. The Monocle has been a place of agreement, often at times when disagreement divided us in this House.  It was Constantine Valanos who brought that warm and inviting place to Capitol Hill and to all who serve here. Many of us knew Connie well. Connie made a point of knowing and remembering all of us who set foot in his restaurant, even if just once in a while. Sadly, Connie passed away last month at age 93.  Constantine George Valanos was born into a family of Greek immigrants in Albany, New York, as the First World War was drawing to a close. He grew up here in Washington, D.C., and served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. Following his discharge, Connie attended the George Washington University and pursued a career in accounting. In 1960, seeing an opportunity to buy and fix up an old restaurant on Capitol Hill, Connie and his wife, Helen--who passed away in 2005 after a fifty-three year marriage--opened the Monocle.  Among their first regular customers were then-Senators John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon. Over the next fifty years the Monocle would see a steady stream of Senators, Representatives, future Presidents and Vice Presidents, Supreme Court justices, foreign diplomats, and ordinary Americans visiting with their elected officials.  After three decades at the helm, Connie and Helen passed the management of the business to their son, John, and daughter-in-law, Vasiliki, who continue to run the Monocle today and provide the same friendly and welcoming environment to all who step through the door.  The ancient Greek statesman Pericles said: ``What you leave behind is not what is engraved in monuments of stone but what is woven into the lives of others.'' Connie Valanos leaves behind a legacy not only of a restaurant but also of the countless ways in which he made that restaurant a place where leaders come together to hash out the agreements that help make our Nation great and improve lives around the world. The Monocle, as former Vice President and regular patron Walter Mondale once noted, is ``where laws are debated, where policies are set, and where the course of world history is changed.'' That is Connie's lasting legacy.  I join in celebrating Connie's life and in offering my condolences to his wife Judith, his children, John and George, his three grandchildren, and the entire Valanos family.                          ____________________
