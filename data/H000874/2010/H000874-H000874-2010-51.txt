 Without getting into a long colloquy, and I appreciate the gentleman's trying to truncate this, let me simply say that I think the suggestions of how we can save money, how we can bring the deficit down from whatever source they come should be welcomed by all of us. Whether they come from your side of the aisle, my side of the aisle, from the public at large, Republicans, Democrats, independents, or totally nonpartisan sources whatsoever, we ought to consider them.  We have a very significant deficit problem confronting us. I won't go into the reasons of why I think we have those deficit problems, but we have them and we have been try to go dig out of a deep economic recession, as all of us know. So I simply wanted to say that, as you know, this week we did vote in a very substantial reduction, the Surface Transportation Savings Act, which passed 402-0. We cut $107 million.  Next week I expect that we are going to have at least one vote, maybe others, to cut substantial dollars. Betsy Markey has an idea that she has introduced that would save $703-plus million. We hope to consider that. But I want to reiterate, which is all I want to say, that we welcome ideas on how to bring the deficit down.  I mentioned, of course, earlier that Mr. Kyl indicated that paying for things were not necessary if they were in the tax field. But cutting other things, the problem is, that was $678 billion that he suggested in borrowed money. And so we are going to have to look, as I said in a speech not too long ago, at all items of expenditure, wherever they may be found, to make sure that we are returned to the fiscal posture, frankly, that we were in when we had a $5.6 trillion surplus in January of 2000.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.
