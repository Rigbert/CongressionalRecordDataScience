President, this morning, the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health, and Human Services and Related Agencies held a hearing on the opioid epidemic and how States are responding to the crisis. I was pleased Beth Tanzman, the executive director of Vermont's Blueprint for Health, agreed to be a witness at today's hearing to share the innovative approaches Vermont has taken to combat opioid use disorders. Ms. Tanzman has also served as Vermont's deputy commissioner for mental health and also directed adult mental health services for Vermont's Department of Mental Health.  While certainly not spared from the opioid epidemic, Vermont is ahead of much of the country in many ways: Our State openly identified the problem, and our former Governor, Peter Shumlin, dedicated his entire State of the State address in 2014 to constructively seek ways to not just help addicts get clean, but to halt this scourge in its tracks. Public health leaders, addiction specialists, doctors, and State leaders came together and implemented a system to integrate substance abuse treatment with primary healthcare.  Ms. Tanzman's testimony focused on the system developed through this collaboration, known as the Hub and Spoke Model. The plan helps support those in recovery with nine regionalhubs, offering daily medication assisted treatment for those with complex addictions, and spokes, where patients receive follow-up care, counseling, and general wellness services. This framework has allowed Vermont to virtually eliminate wait times for treatment, which can be enormous barriers for individuals needing help.  Every State in the Nation has seen the impacts of opioid abuse. Ms. Tanzman's testimony was informative and offers an important perspective for other States struggling with treating addiction. I ask unanimous consent to that her testimony from the Appropriations Committee hearing this morning be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         Department of Vermont Health Access, Vermont Blueprint            for Health  Testimony to the U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor,      Health and Human Services, and Education Regarding the Opioid                       Epidemic--February 28, 2019 Beth Tanzman, MSW, Executive Director, Vermont Blueprint for Health,                   Department of Vermont Health Access       Chairman Blunt, Ranking Member Murray, and Senator Leahy      and staff thank-you for the opportunity to outline what we      are learning in Vermont about addressing the opioid epidemic.       Vermont is here before you because we have successfully      scaled treatment availability for Opioid Use Disorder      statewide. Through our Hub and Spoke program we are currently      treating over 8,000 Vermonters (1.6% of the adult population)      with Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT). Vermont treats a      higher percentage of people with Opioid Use Disorder than any      other state in the nation.       We provide Medication Assisted Treatment in primary care      offices (Spokes) and in specialty addictions treatment      programs (Hubs). Through a Health Home Medicaid plan we've      built a programmatic framework that links primary care      (Spokes) and addictions treatment programs (Hubs). Patients      can move between Hubs and Spokes based on their needs.      Clinical expertise is shared across primary care and      substance abuse treatment providers.       There are strong signals that the Hub and Spoke program is      facilitating positive outcomes. Vermont has the lowest opioid      overdose death rate in New England. Vermonters receiving      Medication Assisted Treatment have lower rates of:      incarceration, hospitalizations, and emergency department use      than do Vermonters with Opioid Use Disorder who receive care      as usual. Our system of deploying teams of nurses and      counselors to primary care Spokes--2 FTE for every 100      Medicaid Members--combined with a strong back-up from Hub      programs has dramatically increased the number of primary      care providers offering Medication Assisted Treatment in      Vermont.       What we're learning may be helpful to others and a few      conclusions stand out.       Medication Assisted Treatment, the combination of      medications and counseling, is the most effective treatment      for opioid use disorder and as such, it should be      consistently available as the standard of care for this      condition.       Insurance should pay for Medication Assisted Treatment. In      Vermont we developed a Medicaid Health Home State Plan      Amendment under the authority of section 2703 of the      Affordable Care Act to create the Hub and Spoke Program.      There are other approaches to using Medicaid that states can      employ including: 1115 B Substance Use Waivers, State Plan      Amendments, including MAT in managed care organization      contracts, and increasing reimbursement rates for targeted      services. Commercial payers should also participate: in      Vermont two of our major commercial plans are piloting      payments for Hub and Spoke Services.       The health system--especially primary care--has a key role      in treating opioid addiction. The addictions treatment system      cannot do this alone; there is simply not enough treatment      capacity to meet the need brought on by this epidemic. The      participation of primary care can effect greater integration      of care, especially by coordinating pharmacological      treatments with counseling, rehabilitation, and recovery      supports.       The barriers to primary care participation in MAT (not      enough provider time, patient complexity, difficulty      integrating counseling supports) can be addressed by adding      nursing and counseling resources to the primary care      prescribing teams, as we did in Vermont.       Treatment is one element of a comprehensive response to the      opioid epidemic. Other elements include prevention--reducing      peoples' exposure to opioids in the first place, harm      reduction such as wide availability of the overdose reversal      medication Narcan to help prevent overdose deaths, and      recovery supports--including vocational services to help      people in recovery participate fully in our communities.       Leadership focus matters. I have had the honor of serving      under two consecutive Governors, Democratic and Republican,      who have both provided leadership and resources to address      the opioid epidemic in Vermont.       In closing, we have made much progress in Vermont, much of      it with the support of our federal partners. Yet while we      have some of the best access to treatment in the nation, we      have not solved this problem. Every week two Vermonters die      from a drug overdose. Tragically we've also experienced high      numbers of children under the age of five, who come into      state custody due to this crisis. We must learn how to do      better by our families and communities.       Thank you.
