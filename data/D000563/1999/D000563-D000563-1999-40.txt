President, in 1996, President Alexander Lukashenka imposed a new constitution on Belarus that effectively destroyed its nascent democracy and returned that country to a Soviet-style police state. Human rights violations are routine and living conditions are deplorable because of the stagnant economy. Opposition leader Simyon Sharetsky fled to Vilnius, Lithuania.  The situation in Belarus has worsened dramatically in recent months for remaining members of the opposition. Some have disappeared, including Viktor Gonchar, Yuri Krasovsky, Yuri Zakharenka, and Tamara Vinnikova. Some have been arrested for taking part in the October 17, 1999 ``Freedom march,'' including Anatoly Lebedko, Chairman of the Committee for International Affairs of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Belarus, Nikolay Statkevich, leader of the Social Democratic Party, and Valery Shchukin, Deputy of the Supreme Council.  Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia are very concerned about the direction Belarus has taken under the Lukashenka regime. Belarus' economy is apparently imploding, and neighboring countries are concerned about regional instability. Our recent experience with Slobodan Milosevic's Yugoslavia should make us all concerned about the implications of a ruthless dictator threatening stability in Europe.  Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia have successfully transformed themselves from Soviet-dominated Communist states to fully democratic market democracies integrated with the West and Western institutions. We must be sure that Belarus does not threaten the remarkable progress these stalwart countries have made in only 10 years since the fall of the Soviet empire.  Also troubling is a draft treaty that may be signed before the end of the year between Lukashenka and President Yeltsin to effect a political union between Russia and Belarus. All Western countries should be concerned that such a union would only hurt efforts to shore up Russia's economy and strengthen its fragile democracy.  That is why my colleague, Senator Campbell, and I join together today to a resolution condemning the actions of the Lukashenka regime. This resolution--a companion measure to one introduced by our colleague in the House of Representatives, Representative Sam Gejdenson--condemns the Lukashenka regime, the arrest of opposition figures and the disappearance of others; calls for a dialog between Lukashenka and the opposition, the restoration of a democratically-elected government and institutions; calls on the U.S. President to fund travel by Belarusian opposition figures and for non-governmental organizations in Belarus and to support information flows into Belarus. I call on my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this resolution.                          ____________________
