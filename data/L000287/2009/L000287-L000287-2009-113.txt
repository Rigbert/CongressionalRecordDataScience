Madam Speaker, I am proud to introduce the Look-Back Elimination Act of 2009.  I am proud to serve on the Ways and Means Committee Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support led by Chairman McDermott. I would like to thank Chairman McDermott, my good friend, the Gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Berkley), and all of my colleagues on the Subcommittee for their hard work in the areas of child welfare and foster care.  Today, American families are struggling in ways not seen since the Great Depression. Rising unemployment, health care costs, and a struggling economy are all taking their toll, and children in the foster care system must not be forgotten during these very difficult times.  When Congress passed welfare reform legislation in 1996, they eliminated the existing Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, which was a cornerstone of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, and replaced it with the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, or TANF. At the same time, Congress locked the income eligibility requirement for federal foster care and adoption assistance benefits at the various existing 1996 income thresholds established by States under the now nonexistent AFDC program. This is known as the look-back standard.  Since that time, the federal law has not been changed, and despite changing economic realities like inflation and wage growth, states cannot update their income eligibility requirements. As a result thousands of children in foster care and adoption assistance programs are ineligible to receive federal benefits.  Last year Congress passed and the President signed legislation to phase out the look-back standard for children in the adoption assistance program. The bill I am introducing today would assist the other children affected by the look-back standard--those in the foster care system. We need to help these children, and we need to help them now.  The look-back standard sets the income limit for eligibility at thirty-one percent of the federal poverty level--a level so low that even a parent's part-time job at minimum wage could render a family ineligible. As a result, states are prohibited from using federal funds to assist those most in need. In my home state of Georgia almost sixty percent of children in the child welfare system cannot receive federal IV-E assistance. Thousands more foster care children across the country are ineligible to receive benefits. This is wrong; it is just plain wrong.  Foster care children need this support, and states are struggling to juggle services to try and prevent children from falling through the cracks. You just cannot put a price on helping a child. We must have this oversight corrected. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this commonsense legislation.                          ____________________
