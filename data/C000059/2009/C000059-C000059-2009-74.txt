Madam Speaker, pursuant to the Republican Leadership standards on earmarks, I am submitting the following information regarding earmarks I received as part of H.R. 2996, the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010.  Requesting Member: Congressman Ken Calvert  Bill Number: H.R. 2996  Account: Environmental Protection Agency, STAG Water and Wastewater Infrastructure  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Western Municipal Water District  Address of Requesting Entity: 450 Alessandro Boulevard, Riverside, CA 92508  Description of Request: H.R. 2996 provides $500,000 for the Western Municipal Water District for Arlington Desalter Biodenitrification project. The funding will be used to build a biological denitrification facility for drinking water. The process, called ``Fixed-Bed Biological Treatment'' (FXB) uses an innovative bioreactor to remove multiple contaminants from groundwater. Western Municipal Water District has completed pilot testing of the FXB process at the Arlington Desalter and has already received conditional approval from the California Department of Public Health for a full scale facility. This new facility will consist of a series of large biofilter, polishing and backwash equalization tanks as well as supply pumps and a new groundwater well. It will be built at the site of the Arlington Desalter in Riverside, California. The project benefits the City of Norco, portions of the City of Riverside, unincorporated areas of Riverside County, and any entity within the Arlington Groundwater Basin by cleaning the area's water supply and creating up to 3.7 million-gallons-per-day of new water.  Requesting Member: Congressman Ken Calvert  Bill Number: H.R. 2996  Account: Environmental Protection Agency, STAG Water and Wastewater Infrastructure  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: City of San Juan Capistrano  Address of Requesting Entity: 32400 Paseo Adelanto, San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675  Description of Request: H.R. 2996 provides $500,000 to the City of San Juan Capistrano for ground water recovery plant expansion and regional distribution facility. The funding will allow the city to expand the current capacity of the existing treatment facility to 7.3 million-gallons-per-day from 5.6 million-gallons-per-day. During the ongoing drought, water that is produced locally can be conveyed to surrounding water agencies thereby reducing the demands placed on the Sacramento Bay Delta and the Colorado River. In the event of a natural disaster or other emergency, the treatment plant will have the ability to function as a regional distribution facility to neighboring water agencies and helping to provide a reliable source of safe drinking water.                          ____________________
