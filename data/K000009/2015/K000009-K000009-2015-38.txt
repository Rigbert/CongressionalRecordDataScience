Chair, I appreciate the gentlewoman from Minnesota, Ranking Member McCollum, as well as Chairman Ken Calvert of California for working with me to include important language relative to the National Park Service.  Specifically, the report addresses a threat to a significant part of the history of the region I represent, the Battle of Lake Erie that paved the way for America's expansion beyond 13 colonies, commemorated by Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial at Put-In-Bay, Ohio.  Perry's Memorial is at the heart of coastal tourism in Ohio, attracting 130,000 visitors just last year, and more than double as many people were reached through their educational activities.  Despite its popularity, this site has been unnecessarily targeted for consolidation. The idea that resources and, more importantly, management of this popular site would shift to a noncontiguous, smaller installation in a different State is both concerning and, frankly, quite puzzling.  Reporting requirements included with the bill are there to ensure that Perry's Memorial will continue operating as a stand-alone site.  I would also ask the chairman and ranking member to continue working with me to address this need moving forward to ensure that this misguided consolidation plan is stopped.
