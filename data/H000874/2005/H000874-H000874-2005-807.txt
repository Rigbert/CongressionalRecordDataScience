Speaker, I yield to the distinguished majority leader for the purpose of inquiring of him the schedule for the coming week.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, the House will convene on Tuesday at 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several measures under suspension of the rules. A final list of those bills will be sent to Members' offices by the end of the week. Any votes called on these measures will be rolled until 6:30 p.m.  On Wednesday, the House will convene at 10 a.m. This is a slow time of year, as most committees are not organizing until next week. We anticipate consideration of a resolution that will stress the House's views on the recent court decision regarding the Solomon amendment, but we do not expect to consider any significant legislation under a rule.  In addition, I would like to remind all Members that the President's State of the Union is scheduled for Wednesday night of next week.  Finally, to accommodate scheduling demands next week similar to those that we have this week, the House will not have votes next Thursday or Friday.  I thank the gentleman for yielding and will be happy to answer any questions he may have.
