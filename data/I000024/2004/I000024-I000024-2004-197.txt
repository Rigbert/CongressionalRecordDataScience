I know it was not deliberately misrepresented, but the information is not accurate that we have heard on this amendment. It is very important that everyone know that, but I would rather have everyone vent everything they want to vent.  I wish to make one comment, first, though. The Senator from Nevada pointed out what we could have done with the six fastest growing States, the largest States. We could have lost six votes and never even looked back. That is exactly what happened 6 years ago. They went into a minimum guarantee program where they were counting votes. It was totally political and that is what we are getting away from. We have a good formula. I will defend that momentarily after we hear from everyone who is speaking in support of this flawed amendment.
