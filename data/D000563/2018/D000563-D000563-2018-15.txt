I don't know her personally, but we can tell his words were heartfelt and could tell of his appreciation for her public service.  On behalf of the Senate, I want to thank her and all of the staff people who make our careers possible. As talented as we may think we are, we wouldn't be anywhere without staffers who are determined to serve the people and serve us.  His tribute to his chief of staff--chief of everything, as he described her--was certainly heartfelt from a man I know is a very sincere and positive individual. I just wanted to say those words.                        Tribute to Joe Donnelly
