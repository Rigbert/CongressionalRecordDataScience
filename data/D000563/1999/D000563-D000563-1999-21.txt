Frankly, I think that was really the critical debate, when it came to the future of that amendment and when the Republican majority rejected our attempts to protect the Social Security trust fund in the balanced budget amendment debate. That was the end of the debate. As I recall, that amendment lost by one or two votes at the most. I voted against it. I think the Senator from Nevada did as well. If it was not going to protect Social Security, then we should not go forward with it.  As I reflect on it, it is a little over 2\1/2\ years ago that the battle cry on Capitol Hill was: The deficits, the balanced budget amendment, let the courts step in and have Congress stop spending; that was our only hope. Now we are in the era of surpluses. We have changed so dramatically without that constitutional amendment.  The Senator from Nevada recalls accurately the Social Security trust fund was a viable issue at that point.
