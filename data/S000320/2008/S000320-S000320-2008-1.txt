 President, I have a few minutes, but first I wish to commend my colleague and fellow member of the Banking Committee, Senator Corker, for his work in this regard, trying to forge a compromise.  Of course, I think most of you know where I stand on bailouts. I do not think they work. I do not believe this one would ever work. But these companies could be saved. These companies could be saved. I have said I think they are bloated, the management is bloated. These companies either have already failed or are failing. That is a shame. These are not the General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler I knew. But all of us in America will benefit by competition.  I come from the South, where we have a growing automobile industry, but there are 300 million people in this country, the largest automobile market in the world. There is no reason for General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler not to be competitive, but they are not going to be competitive, folks, as long as they are operating under this business model. Whether they get money soon or next year or what, it is going to be probably a lot of money.  But I want to tell the American people tonight, bailouts generally do not work. And this is a huge proposed bailout. I fear it is just the downpayment on more to come next year. So I would vote no on this tonight.
