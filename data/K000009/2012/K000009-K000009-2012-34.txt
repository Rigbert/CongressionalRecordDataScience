Flake's proposal.  Now, if Mr. Flake came to the floor and cut money from well-larded Arizona projects, I might ponder that type of amendment--but I don't support cuts in HOME. With the devastation that's occurred across our housing market, we shouldn't harm housing for sure. But, if he would take the money to balance the budget from the subsidized Central Arizona Water Project, or if he would take the funds from the major Federal monuments that are stacked wall-to-wall in his State of Arizona, or if he would take the funds from all the defense facilities that help to employ and hold up the economy of his State--those might be worthy of debate.  It's very interesting where he cuts money from--from among the poorest areas in this country, some of the most devastated parts of America that are trying to rebuild themselves. It's very curious to me when he proposes amendments, whether it be this one or other ones in subcommittee, he always leaves his home turf sacrosanct.
