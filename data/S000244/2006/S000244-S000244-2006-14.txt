Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time.  Mr. Speaker, I deeply appreciate the words of my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers).  This is kind of a tough act to follow, but I would like to state for the record that the Judiciary Committee, because it has such a vast jurisdiction and an awful lot of controversial legislation, that by working with Mr. Conyers and the members of the minority, and having the majority and minority staff work together, we knew that there were some philosophical differences on many of the pieces of legislation that could not be bridged without a vigorous debate and votes both in committee and on the floor of the House of Representatives. But the cooperation and the respect and the trust that we had across the aisle were able to narrow those differences so that what we did debate were true differences in approach and true differences in policy.  I keep on telling the high school classes that I talk to about what really goes on here that 95 percent of the bills that we pass are worked out in committee, and the debate and votes on the floor merely ratify decisions that have been made earlier in committee. The problem is that compromise agreement, and I would even submit accomplishment, do not get any media attention. It is allegations of misconduct, actual knock out, drag down fights in those areas that we do have disagreements on that really monopolize the news media.                              {time}  1615  As a result, people get the wrong impression that all we do out here is fight and argue amongst ourselves. And while we do a lot of that, and I think the framers of the Constitution intended the Congress of the United States to do that, the tremendous work product of the committee over the last 6 years I think has been due in large part by the trust and respect and agreement that we have had in working across the aisle.  And while I was sitting here listening to the debate, I was going through the calendars of the House of Representatives looking at the number of committee reports we filed, and I think it is somewhere in the 90 to 100 number range during this Congress. And a lot of these reports were really on controversial and complicated legislation where we needed to have a committee report to explain what the intent of Congress was, and that type of cooperation allowed us to have that tremendous output of work product.  It has been my honor to chair this committee for the last 6 years, but I can say one of the things that I am most proud of is the fact that, where it has been possible, I have been able to reach across the aisle and work with my friend from Michigan, and I think that he and I have each directed our respective staffs to do the same thing, and we can be proud of what we have done not only in this Congress but in the previous two Congresses. And although our roles will be kind of reversed in the next Congress, I look forward to continuing to build on that cooperation so that the country knows that the Judiciary Committee not only is the place to be at, but it is the folks that get things done.  So I thank you very much for your very, very good comments. You have been instrumental in putting together that record of accomplishment, and I think we can be proud of what the committee has done.
