Chairman, I thank the gentleman and rise in opposition to this Republican plan under which the seniors in our community alone will lose over $377 million over the next 7 years.  I rise today in opposition to the bill before us and to raise serious concerns with the manner in which H.R. 2425, the Medicare Preservation Act, has been railroaded through the House of Representatives. Literally millions of citizens in our country depend on Medicare as their lifeline. These 36 million older and disabled people receive medical insurance through this program. Congress must proceed carefully before taking any action that will affect the lives and futures of millions of our families and their loved ones. Cutting $270 billion from Medicare and then transferring that money for tax cuts to the rich is absolutely wrong.                                 timing  On Friday, September 29, legislation was officially introduced to reform Medicare. What did the leadership of the House do next? Did it hold comprehensive hearings on the most sweeping changes to Medicare since its inception 30 years ago? No--they allowed only 1 day of hearings before their bill was distributed to Members and left town, only to return on October 9 and proceed with marking up the bill. No senior citizens were even invited to testify.  The committees marked up around the clock until Wednesday October 11. Mr. Chairman, the legislative process used to move this bill has been a disgrace. This Congress has spent 48 days holding hearings on Whitewater, Ruby Ridge--we even spent an afternoon debating snails--but they could not manage to hold more than 1 day of hearings on Medicare.  The very people who will be most affected by these cuts, our Nation's seniors, have been subject to arrest and silenced as the leadership rushed this bill through committees. Could we not have allowed just 1 day to hear their concerns? With $136 billion in the current Medicare part A trust fund there are funds to meet obligations for 7 years. We know we must act, but why the rush?  Members, especially those not on the committees of jurisdiction such as myself, have been given very little time to review these sweeping changes. This is not the way to legislate. We have disenfranchised the American public by not allowing their elected representatives to do their job--to analyze and make an informed vote on Medicare reform. And the American people have been barred from testifying, and senior citizens in the hearing room were even arrested.                      republican plan and tax cuts  Mr. Chairman, this past weekend I met with our community's health advisory group, a bipartisan group of citizens from my district representing health professions, businesses, labor, retirees, insurance, hospitals, and all health professions. The group was charged with analyzing the Medicare trustees report and the Medicare Preservation Act.  The consensus of the group was that these Medicare cuts are draconian. Any changes in Medicare should be used only for the preservation of Medicare and should not be used to provide a tax cut for the wealthy. Our health advisory group stated that they would not operate a business the way this bill has been considered and that the Congress is making too many changes too fast. The members of the group also stated emphatically that this is absolutely the wrong time to be discussing a tax cut whose beneficiaries are primarily the wealthier among us, with those in upper incomes emphasizing that it is right that they pay their fair share.  Our health advisory group suggests a short-term solution must address waste, fraud, and abuse, spiraling health costs of prescription drugs, labs, equipment, doctor and hospital fees, home health care, vision and dental care, and durable medical equipment. New ways to fix the long-term financing of Medicare must also be explored including the high cost of pharmaceuticals and private insurance. Research and development of drugs is a cost of doing business and should not be passed on the consumers in the form of higher prescription drug prices. A national commission must be set up for this purpose of developing a long-term solvency plan for the Medicare Program beyond 2010.  The trustees report has been cited as the reason reform is needed. I agree. Medicare is facing a short-term financing crisis in the part A hospital insurance [HI] trust fund which we must solve this year and a long-term crisis which needs much more careful consideration. However the plan before us cuts $270 billion from Medicare when the trustees only call for $90 billion in savings. In addition, the plan before us doubles part B premiums and we all know that not one dime of that money will go to the HI trust fund cited in the trustees report. Where is all this money going? To a balanced budget? No. It is being used to pay for a $245 billion tax cut for the privileged few in our society.  I cannot and will not vote for a bill which provides a tax cut to the wealthy on the backs of our senior citizens.                            fraud and abuse  As I visit the senior centers of my district one message resonates. It is time to cut fraud and abuse. Find your savings by hiring more investigators to crack down on the crooks in the system, do not make cuts at the expense of seniors. Isn't it ironic that the majority passed legislation earlier this year that would eliminate 72 fraud and abuse inspectors at HHS Office of the Inspector General. The plan before us actually weakens the ability of HHS to detect waste, fraud, and abuse. In fact, the HHS Inspector General June Gibbs Brown states that this bill would:  Make the existing civil monetary penalty and antikickback laws considerably more lenient and place an insurmountable burden of proof on the Government to punish illegal kickbacks;  Relieve providers of the legal duty to use reasonable diligence for insuring that the claims they submit to Medicare and Medicaid are true and accurate;  Create new exemptions to the law which could be exploited by those who wish to pay rewards or incentives to physicians for the referral of patients; and divert to private contractors scare resources currently devoted to law enforcement against fraud and abuse.  In conclusion, let us take our time and truly study the changes that are needed to provide both long-and short-term solutions to our system of Medicare financing. Let me quote from the book ``Intensive Care'', ``The health care system in the U.S. is far too complicated for anyone or any group to claim that a single reform plan is the solution to the crisis. Rather than taking a huge first step with a new untested system, wouldn't it make sense to pilot test a number of proposals? This is the only reasonable method to determine what works and what doesn't work. The danger with scrapping any old system of any kind is that a new system may not be any better.''  Mr. Chairman, let us heed this advice. Send this bill back to the committees of jurisdiction and let us do this reform in a reasoned, bipartisan manner.
