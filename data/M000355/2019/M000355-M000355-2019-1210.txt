 President, today I would like to remember the remarkable life and lasting impact of Robin Dale Holbrook, of Banner, KY, who passed away last month in a tragic accident. Robin, who was widely admired for his selfless compassion and unshakable integrity, dedicated his life to improving the health of his Floyd County community for nearly three decades.  Robin was the clinic director at the Eula Hall Healthcare Center in Mud Creek, where he made a difference in the lives of so many. I have had the privilege to visit this important center, in this rural Appalachian community, which provides comprehensive services to many Kentuckians who may not have access to other care. As both a physician's assistant and an administrator, Robin's coworkers remembered he didn't approach his work as a job, but rather a passion. Caring for the members of his community was a calling for Robin and a way to live out his Christian ministry.  The staff at the Eula Hall center intend to show respect for his memory by delivering the same level of care Robin gave to patients every single day.  On July 3, Robin's family, friends, and colleagues will celebrate his life at the clinic where he served his community. I would like to join them as they honor this impressive man and his decades of kindness and service to Floyd County. Elaine and I extend our condolences to Robin's wife, Angela, his family, and his many friends.                          ____________________
