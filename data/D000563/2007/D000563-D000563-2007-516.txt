I see Senator Leahy has come to the floor.  I can say for the record--he can back me up--not only was Judge Southwick given a hearing--which many nominees in the previous administration were not given a fair hearing, I believe; and I think all present would say--there has been no effort to stop Senator Specter or any Republican from calling this nomination for a vote.  I wish also to ask the Senator from South Carolina, is he aware of the fact that the only African-American Congressman from the State of Mississippi, the Magnolia Bar Association, which represents most African-American attorneys in Mississippi, and the major civil rights group have expressed their opposition to the nomination of Judge Southwick?
