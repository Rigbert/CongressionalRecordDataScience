Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the late Walter H. Maloney, known to his friends as Mike. Mike represented the First District on the Prince George's County Council at the time of his death and he was a leading figure in County politics for four decades. He was legendary for his political independence, perseverance and his remarkable commitment to public service.  Mike was born in Kansas City, Missouri in 1930 and came to Washington, DC in 1937 when his father was recruited to work in the Roosevelt Administration. Mike's mother taught music at the Sidwell Friends School in Washington, DC where Mike also attended school. Mike went on to graduate from Georgetown University and its law school. He also received a LLM degree from the University of Michigan Law School before joining the U.S. Army. Mike was commissioned as a first lieutenant and served in the Judge Advocate General's Corps in La Rochelle, France.  After serving in the Army, Mike embarked upon his impressive career as assistant counsel to the United States Senate Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights chaired by Senator Sam Ervin. He then moved on to the National Labor Relations Board as a trial attorney in the Baltimore regional office, and was appointed a Federal administrative law judge at the NLRB in 1973. Mike worked at the NLRB until his retirement in 1994. He also taught labor law on the adjunct faculty of the University of Maryland University College from 1956 to 1971.  Mike prided himself on fighting for the little guy and his work at NLRB is proof of that dedication. As an administrative law judge, he won national acclaim from the nation's editorial pages and from Congresswoman Bella Abzug on the Floor of this House for his decision in the landmark Farrah slacks case in which he detailed the mistreatment of factory workers in a Texas textile shop.  Mike and his wife, Cecelia, moved to Prince George's County in 1958. He quickly immersed himself in civic activism and was elected a delegate to the statewide Democratic convention in 1962. He also began forty years of involvement in County public affairs by joining efforts to adopt a home rule charter for the County and reform zoning practices.  In 1968, Mike was elected to the Charter Board, which was created by the voters to draft a proposed home rule charter for Prince George's County. Mike chaired the five member board and is widely regarded as the author of the County's modern form of government.  Mike's efforts helped bring about a sweeping reform of the County's government. The County Commissioner system was abolished and replaced by an elected County Executive and council with home rule powers. Prince George's County had previously been run by the Maryland General Assembly in Annapolis.  Mike's reform efforts did not stop with the adoption of the new Charter. He led the way in the election of a bipartisan slate in 1971 and was appointed as the first County Attorney under the new Charter.  Mike helped guide the new County government during his time as Attorney General until he resigned to become a Federal administrative law judge. The incisive and hard-hitting nature of his legal opinions as Attorney General earned him the nickname ``Iron Mike.``  Mike's demanding career at NLRB did not prevent him from being active in local affairs or from working extensively on local bond and zoning issues over the years. In 1994, following his retirement from the Federal Government, Mike ran a successful grassroots campaign for the Prince George's County Council. He was re-elected in 1998.  As a member of the Council, Mike continued to assert his political independence and to use his sharp mind to challenge land use and spending policies, and fight for the best interests of the community. At the time of his death, Mike was ineligible to run for the Council again thanks to term limits that he helped put in place.  Mike was a devout Catholic and had a deep interest in Catholic history. He authored a profile of 58 historic catholic churches east of the Mississippi titled ``Our Catholic Roots.`` He also received many accolades throughout his long career in public service for his dedication to his local community and the environment.  Mike is survived by his wife of 46 years, Cecelia Fitzpatrick, and six children, Timothy F. Maloney, Eileen Maloney Flynn, Kathy Maloney Gawne, Patrick J. Maloney, John M. Maloney, and Ann Marie Maloney, and twelve grandchildren. One of his greatest prides was his loving family and all of their many achievements. Mike was known to boast about them all and was happiest when surrounded by his many children and grandchildren.  Mike Maloney will be sorely missed not only by those who knew him but also by the residents of Prince George's County whom certainly benefited from his dedication to his community and to the ``little guy.'' I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring this dedicated public servant who leaves behind a loving family and many admirers who will miss him greatly.                          ____________________
