President, now that the elections are over, I renew my callfor all of us to come together to do what is right and to act in the interests of the American people. We should come together to avert the fiscal cliff and the automatic cuts that will otherwise occur in domestic and defense spending.  I am hopeful that, working together, Democrats and Republicans can come to an agreement so that we can avoid sequestration. The automatic cuts from sequestration would further damage our Federal courts. According to the sequestration report released by the Office of Management and Budget, the sequestration would lead to a $555 million reduction below fiscal year 2012 levels for our independent judiciary. The impending across-the-board cuts under sequestration would reduce Federal court allotments to fiscal year 2006 levels, despite considerably higher caseloads. The impact of sequestration on Federal court operations nationwide could be devastating. It could result in the Federal courts eliminating as many as 6,300 employees, about one-third of their staff, or implementing court employees furloughs for more than a month system-wide.  If we do not find a solution to both the vacancy crisis and the threat to judicial resources, it will be harder for Americans to obtain justice in our Federal courts. Our courts are already overburdened, and the sequester will result in cuts that will force courts to hear fewer cases, which means that court proceedings will be delayed even longer. This will be especially damaging in civil cases, where there are already over 40,000 cases that have been pending for more than 3 years. Sequestration cuts could even result in the suspension of civil jury trials. Even more alarming is what is at stake in the criminal context. If probation and pretrial services offices are downsized or closed, Federal courts and their staff will be unable to properly supervise thousands of persons under pretrial release and convicted felons released from Federal prisons. It is critical, then, that we work together.  And we should complete the task of considering the judicial nominees who have already had their hearings before the Senate recessed for the elections. There is no justification for holding up final Senate action on these judicial nominations. These are not judgeships that Republicans can claim they wish to keep open in order to be filled by nominees from President Obama's successor next year. The American people have decided that President Obama will continue to lead our Nation. In accordance with the will of the American people, it is time for the obstruction to end and for the Senate to complete action on these nominees so that they may serve the American people without further delay. Even Senate Republicans' contorted application of the Thurmond Rule can no longer serve as any sort of rationale for inaction. Delay for delay's sake is wrong and should end. The Senate should start by acting on the 19 judicial nominations that have been approved by the Judiciary Committee and have been awaiting final Senate action without further delay.  Two months ago, the Senate recessed without taking action on 19 judicial nominations. All were supported by their home State Senators, Republican and Democratic. Almost all had bipartisan support. I cannot remember a time when the Senate refused to act on nominees with such bipartisan support. There was no precedent for the filibuster of Robert Bacharach of Oklahoma to the Tenth Circuit and that filibuster should end. After Senator Coburn failed to vote for cloture to end the filibuster of the Bacharach nomination last July, he indicated that he expected Judge Bacharach to be confirmed before the end of the year if President Obama was reelected. The junior Senator from Texas also indicated that the circuit judges would be voted on if President Obama was reelected. Well, now that the people of this country have spoken, we should be working together to approve these judicial nominees so they can provide justice for the American people.  I urge Senate Republicans to come together and work with us to consider these judicial nominees without further delay. They should agree to debate and then to let the Senate vote on the nominations of Judge Patty Shwartz of New Jersey to the Third Circuit, Richard Taranto to the Federal Circuit, William Kayatta of Maine to the First Circuit, Robert Bacharach of Oklahoma to the Tenth Circuit, and the district court nominees from Connecticut, Maryland, Florida, Oklahoma, Michigan, California, New York, Pennsylvania, and Illinois. I am also working to have the Judiciary Committee complete its consideration of five more judicial nominees who had their hearing in September. With the confirmation of these nominees, we can eliminate the backlog here in the Senate and take a significant step toward filling a good portion of the judicial vacancies that have been plaguing our courts, including filling over a dozen judicial emergency vacancies.  The president of the Hispanic National Bar Association wrote a letter to the Senate Leaders in September saying: ``The fact that Congress is adjourning without confirming these candidates is of great concern, and is a disservice to the Federal Courts and the people they serve.'' He was right. Now that the election is over, let us come together as the Senate of the United States and make progress on behalf of the American people.  The New York Times noted in an editorial last month entitled ``Politics and the Courts'' that: ``During the Obama years, nominees presenting no ideological threat have been held up in the Republicans' campaign of partisan attack and obstruction--even against trial judges. * * * The holdups have cost Americans dearly--in justice delayed (it now generally takes two years to get a federal civil trial) and justice denied.'' Now that the election is over, let us do what we can to mitigate the damage and move forward.  The number of judicial vacancies has, again, risen above 80. I have heard from judges around the country whose courts have vacancies. They are working hard to keep their courts functioning, but they need help to ensure that all Americans have access to courts and to justice. Recently, Professor Carl Tobias summed up the vacancy crisis that has been plaguing us for the last four years. Professor Tobias is right, and we need to expeditiously confirm our judicial nominees so they can deliver justice for the American people. I ask consent that his full article in The Hill, entitled, ``Obstruction in Senate Taking Its Toll on the Courts,'' appear in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  We can begin to help address the vacancy crisis by confirming the 19 nominees who are currently waiting for final Senate action. The four circuit court nominees have each been waiting at least 5 months for a vote. One has been stalled for more than 8 months. The 15 district court nominees have all been waiting at least 3 months, with some stalled for as long as 7 months.  The Republican Senator from Pennsylvania wrote a letter to the Majority leader and Senator McConnell asking that the two nominees for the Middle District of Pennsylvania be considered. I want to see those nominees, as well as the dozen whose Senate votes have been delayed even longer, and all the judicial nominees who have had a hearing, acted upon by the Senate.  The Senate should not continue down the path of unprecedented obstruction and delay. President Obama had not sought to pick an ideological fight with the Senate on judicial nominees as his predecessor had done. By way of example, the Republican Senators from Oklahoma have said that they support Robert Bacharach, and the Republican Senators from Maine strongly support William Kayatta. It is unprecedented to have this many consensus judicial nominees not acted upon before the election recess in a presidential election year.  The American people deserve better, and I know the Senate can do better. After the midterm election in 2002, Senate Democrats worked with Senate Republicans to confirm 20 of President Bush's judicial nominees in 1 week, including 18 in just 1 day. Again, in 2010, the Senate proceeded to confirm 19 judicial nominees during the lameduck session after the election. Unfortunately, Republican delays in 2010 had backlogged 38 judicial nominees and the confirmations of 19 went only halfway to what we should have done.  When Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush were President, Senate Democrats cleared the calendar of all but the most controversial and extreme ideological judicialnominations. The Senate needs to be allowed to vote on President Obama's judicial nominees now so that our Federal courts are better able to function and fulfill the fundamental guarantee of providing access to justice. I hope that now that President Obama has been reelected, Senate Republicans will work with us to fill these longstanding judicial vacancies. The American people deserve no less.  When an injured plaintiff sues to help cover the cost of his or her medical expenses, or when two small business owners disagree over a contract, they should not have to wait years for a court to resolve their dispute. Americans are rightfully proud of our legal system and its promise of access to justice and speedy trials. This promise is embedded in our Constitution. When overburdened courts make it hard to keep this promise, the Senate should work in a bipartisan manner to help.  I ask unanimous consent that the letters to which I referred be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                            Hispanic National Bar Association,                               Washington, DC, September 25, 2012.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Senate Majority Leader,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Republican Leader,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Reid and McConnell: On behalf of the Hispanic      National Bar Association (HNBA), which represents the      interests of the 100,000 Hispanic attorneys, judges, and law      professors in the United States and Puerto Rico, we write      expressing our concern that Congress is adjourning without      confirming the remaining Latino nominees and HNBA endorsed      nominees pending on the Senate Executive Calendar. As a bar      association, one of our greatest priorities is to advocate      for a diverse judiciary and legal profession, and we believe      that having a judiciary that is reflective of the citizenry      should be one of Congress' priorities.       Fernando Olguin and Jesus Bernal, who have been nominated      for seats in the Central District of California, and William      Kayatta, who has been nominated to the First Circuit in      Maine, are all highly qualified, noncontroversial candidates      with bipartisan support who were voted out of the Senate      Judiciary Committee by voice. Despite their qualifications      and the lack of any substantive opposition to their      nominations, they have been pending on the Senate calendar      for months--Mr. Olguin and Mr. Bernal for over two months,      and Mr. Kayatta for over five months--waiting to be      confirmed. This is especially concerning considering both Mr.      Bernal and Mr. Olguin are nominated to seats that have been      deemed judicial emergencies, and Mr. Kayatta is nominated for      the First Circuit. The fact that Congress is adjourning      without confirming these candidates is of great concern, and      is a disservice to the Federal Courts and the people they      serve.       It is of utmost importance for the operational capacity and      overall integrity of our judicial system that we appoint and      confirm quality and experienced individuals to serve in the      Federal judiciary in a timely manner. Given the number of      judicial emergencies and growing caseloads across the      country, the need to fill vacancies efficiently and      expeditiously has become paramount. It is of vital importance      that qualified, noncontroversial nominees are confirmed as      quickly as possible. With that, we again urge your      consideration of the Latino nominees and HNBA endorsed      nominees currently pending on the Senate Calendar.           Sincerely,                                          Peter M. Reyes, Jr.,                             National President, Hispanic National     Bar Association.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, Oct. 16, 2012]                        Politics and the Courts       The winner of the presidential election will have scores of      federal judgeships to fill and the chance to shape the      courts--even aside from potential Supreme Court vacancies      should one or more of the current justices retire.       After a slow start, the Obama administration picked up the      pace in filling judgeships, but it will end up with more      vacancies on Election Day than the day the president took      office. Currently, 32 positions, considered ``judicial      emergencies'' by court administrators, are unfilled, creating      heavy workloads for judges on those courts.       On the federal appeals courts, the final arbiters on all      but the tiny percentage of cases decided by the Supreme      Court, there are now 14 judgeships open out of 179 total      seats. With about six judges a year taking senior status,      working only part time, the next president could have as many      as 40 appellate openings to fill by the end of 2016.       On the trial courts, which resolve around 325,000 cases a      year, six times the number of appeals court cases, there are      now 62 vacancies out of 677 positions.       Much of the problem, of course, has been the broken      confirmation process in the Senate, where Republicans have      used the filibuster to block judicial nominees for no reason      except to prevent President Obama from filling the seats. In      the next Congress, the Senate should ensure every nominee an      up-or-down vote within 90 days.       The United States Court of Appeals for the District of      Columbia, one of the nation's most important courts, has      suffered particularly in this process, with three unfilled      seats and no judge confirmed for the court since 2006.       Politicization has also crept into the process for      approving district court nominees. In the 101st Congress in      1989 and 1990, 96 percent of the district court nominees      picked by President George H. W. Bush were confirmed, and the      confirmation process took on average just 77 days. Twenty      years later, only 56 percent of President Obama's nominees      were confirmed and the process took on average 174 days.       During the Obama years, nominees presenting no ideological      threat have been held up in the Republicans' campaign of      partisan attack and obstruction--even against trial judges      whose decisions are rarely ideological and can be appealed.       The holdups have cost Americans dearly--in justice delayed      (it now generally takes two years to get a federal civil      trial) and justice denied. It is time to adopt a more      efficient, less political approach to district court      confirmations. The courts must be brought to full strength so      they can meet the demands for justice. The next president and      the new Senate should make reforming the confirmation process      a paramount priority.                                  ____               [The Hill's Congress Blog, Oct. 31, 2012]           Obstruction in the Senate Takes Its Toll on Courts                            (By Carl Tobias)       Halloween is the perfect occasion for analyzing scary      federal judicial selection with three judges assuming senior      status on October 31. The bench experiences 83 vacancies in      the 858 appellate and district judgeships. The openings first      spiked to 90 in August 2009 and have since remained near ten      percent. These empty seats are ghost-like apparitions that do      nothing to resolve huge caseloads. Thus, President Barack      Obama must promptly nominate, and the Senate expeditiously      confirm, lower court nominees, or the nation will confront      the nightmare of a judiciary that cannot deliver justice.       Since 1987, Republican and Democratic accusations,      countercharges and paybacks have haunted selection mainly      because of divided government. Democrats now control the      White House and the Senate. However, the party should      continue cooperating with Republicans to reduce these      counterproductive dynamics because the process has stopped      until the November lame duck session.       President Obama has vigorously consulted with Republican      and Democratic senators from states where vacancies      materialized before actual nominations. Obama has proffered      uncontroversial nominees, of even temperament, who are smart,      ethical, diligent and independent and diverse in terms of      ethnicity, gender and ideology.       Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the Judiciary Committee      chairman, has rapidly conducted hearings and votes,      condemning (sending) nominees to unending nights of the      living dead on the floor where many languished over months.      For example, in late September, the Senate confirmed two      nominees, although it could easily have voted on another 19      nominees with committee approval. Indeed, the Senate recessed      without considering any of those well qualified nominees,      most of whom the committee reported absent substantive      opposition, because the GOP refused to vote.       Republicans should stop their tricks and treat the process      more cooperatively. The primary bottleneck has been the      floor. Senator Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the minority leader,      has played the role of Dracula, sucking the lifeblood out of      qualified nominees' candidacies by rarely agreeing to final      votes. Even the dreaded Ninth Circuit nominee Goodwin Liu--     whom McConnell and his colleagues outrageously characterized      as the Second Coming of Earl Warren and refused any vote--has      proved to be a remarkably mainstream California Supreme Court      Justice. Most problematic has been Republican rejection of      votes on noncontroversial strong nominees, inaction that      violates Senate customs. When the chamber has ultimately      voted, it has approved many nominees unanimously or by      substantial majorities.       The 179 appellate judgeships, 15 of which are open, are      crucial because the dozen circuits are courts of last resort      in their regions for 99 percent of appeals. Obama has      proposed seven exceptional nominees, and he should keep      working with Leahy and Senator Harry Reid (D-Nev.), the      majority leader, who arranges floor votes, and their      Republican counterparts to facilitate smooth confirmation      while nominating strong candidates for the eight openings      that lack nominees. On June 13, the GOP leadership invoked      the ``Thurmond Rule,'' which masqueraded as a binding      mandate, saying it would oppose votes on all appellate      nominees until the election. Because this notion does not      apply to excellent, consensus nominees, like First, Tenth,      and Federal Circuit nominees William Kayatta, Robert      Bacharach and Richard Taranto, the Senate must vote on them      soon.       The 679 district judgeships, 68 of which are open, are      essential, as district judges conduct federal trials and      ascertain the facts, while appeals courts uphold 80 percent      of     lower court decisions. Obama has nominated 27 excellent      individuals and must quickly suggest candidates for the 41      vacancies without nominees. For its part, the Senate must      swiftly confirm nominees.       The vacancies in 83 judgeships resulting from GOP      obstruction have, like Dr. Frankenstein, created monstrous      dockets that jeopardize expeditious, inexpensive and fair      case resolution. Thus, President Obama must promptly      nominate, and senators rapidly confirm, numerous superb      judges, so the courts can deliver justice. Boo!                          ____________________
