 President, I know we are getting close to the end of the debate, and we will soon be voting on cloture. I wish to take a few moments to read a few excerpts from editorials that ran in, of all publications, the Wall Street Journal, dealing with Chairman Bernanke, his tenure in office, his misdeeds, and so forth. I also ask unanimous consent at this time that the full text of the editorials, dated January 25, 2010, December 3, 2009, and June 23, 2009, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Wall Street Journal--June 23, 2009]                        Bernanke at the Creation       What the Fed Chairman said at the onset of the credit      bubble, and the lesson for today.       The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets today,      amid a debate over how and when to remove the flood of      liquidity it has poured into the economy in the last 18      months. Fed officials say not to worry, they're as vigilant      about inflation as ever--which is itself a reason to worry.      We've all seen this movie before, when the Fed's failure to      act in time gave birth to the housing bubble and credit mania      that eventually led to panic and today's recession. Will it      make the same mistake now?       We remember that 2003 debate because it turns out we played      a part in it. The Fed recently released the transcripts of      its 2003 FOMC meetings, and what a surprise to find a Journal      editorial the subject of an insider rebuttal from none other      than Ben Bernanke, then a Fed Governor and now Chairman. We      had run an editorial on monetary policy on the same day as      the Dec. 9, 2003 FOMC meeting, and Mr. Bernanke clearly      didn't take well to our warning about ``Speed Demons at the      Fed.''       We reprint nearby both Mr. Bernanke's comments and our      editorial from that day. Readers can judge who got the better      of the argument, but far more important is what Mr.      Bernanke's reasoning tells us about the Fed today. Our guess      is that it won't reassure holders of dollar assets.       * * *       Recall that by the end of 2003 the economy was well into      recovery. Third quarter GDP growth had clocked in at 8.2%      (later restated to 7.5%), and growth in all of 2004 would be      3.6%. The Bush tax cuts had passed in late May, providing a      fiscal boost, and a month later the Fed had cut its fed funds      rate to 1% and would hold it there for a year. Yet by      December Mr. Bernanke was still giving speeches fretting      about ``deflation,'' even as commodity prices were rising and      growth was kicking into higher gear. Thus our Dec. 9 warning,      the first of many by us and others.        Mr. Bernanke's FOMC remarks that day are especially      revealing about how he thinks about monetary policy. In      particular, he dismisses any link between commodity price      increases and future inflation. He cites a study by a Fed      economist claiming to find little connection between      ``materials'' prices and overall inflation. Yet the price of      oil was already rising sharply at the time, and it would keep      rising as the Fed maintained negative real interest rates for      many more months. This was a bad mistake.       Rising gas and food prices didn't show up in the Fed's      ``core'' inflation measurements, but they sure did wallop      U.S. consumers this decade. It's one reason Americans never      felt great about the expansion. The soaring price of oil also      contributed to the housing bubble by transferring wealth from      U.S. consumers to oil exporters such as the Gulf States and      Russia, which in turn recycled those petrodollars into U.S.      Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. By ignoring      commodity prices, the Fed fueled the housing boom.       It's also striking how dismissive Mr. Bernanke is of the      declining dollar. We'd have thought the greenback's value      would be the Fed's paramount concern, given its mandate to      keep prices stable. Yet Mr. Bernanke declared that ``large      movements of the dollar against major currencies tend to      translate into smaller movements against the U.S. trade-     weighted basket of currencies and into still smaller effects      on import prices because of imperfect pass-throughs.''      Translation: Exchange-rate fluctuations aren't the Fed's      problem, no matter how disruptive their effect on trade and      capital flows.       Instead of following these actual prices, Mr. Bernanke's      main monetary policy guide is something called ``the output      gap.'' This is the difference between actual GDP growth and      the level of ``potential output,'' or how fast the economy      can grow when it's at full capacity. The problem with this      guide is that it relies heavily on labor costs and the      jobless rate. And because job creation tends to lag economic      recovery, these signals tend to flash yellow long after price      pressures or asset bubbles have begun to build.       All of this is relevant today because there is no evidence      that Mr. Bernanke and his Fed colleagues have changed their      thinking. They still ignore a falling dollar and rising      commodity prices, even as oil has climbed to $70 a barrel      from $40 six months ago. They also continue to be slaves to      the output gap, which means they are unlikely even to begin      to tighten as long as the jobless rate remains high. With      that rate now at 9.4% and likely to rise, the monetary      spigots will probably remain wide open for a long time to      come.       We think the Fed made the right call last fall when it      eased dramatically in the heat of the panic. The financial      shock had caused a decline in the velocity of money, and the      Fed needed to boost the supply of money to prevent a genuine      deflation. The recession this time is far deeper than in      2001-2002, so there is also a case to be made for erring on      the side of being slower to tighten.       But this time the Fed has also gone to greater easing      lengths than it ever has, taking short-rates nearly to zero      and making direct purchases of mortgage securities and even      Treasuries. These are extraordinary acts that push the Fed      deeply into fiscal policy, credit allocation and directly      monetizing Treasury debt. Combined with the 2003-2005      mistake, they have also raised grave doubts about the Fed's      credibility and independence.       * * *       Mr. Bernanke will need political courage that we haven't      seen since Paul Volcker was Chairman in order to exit from      all of these efforts in time to prevent another bubble or      broader inflation. It also wouldn't hurt if the Fed chief      looks back with some humility on his intellectual certainty,      circa 2003, and analyzes why he was so wrong.                                  ____              [From the Wall Street Journal--Dec. 3, 2009]                          The Bernanke Record       Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke faces his Senate      renomination hearing today, amid signs that the confirmation      skids are greased. We nonetheless think someone should say      that, as a matter of accountability for the financial crisis      and looking at the hard monetary choices to come, the country      needs a new Fed chief.       We say this not because of Mr. Bernanke's performance      during the financial panic of 2008, for which he has been      widely and often deservedly praised. Like others in the      regulatory cockpit at the time, he had to make difficult      choices with imperfect information and when the markets were      shooting with real bullets.       He supplied ample liquidity when it was most needed last      autumn, and he has certainly been willing to pull out every      last page of the central banker playbook. If some of those      decisions were mistakes, the conditions the Fed faced were      extraordinary. Anyone at the helm would have made calls that      in hindsight he'd regret.       The real problem is Mr. Bernanke's record before the panic,      with its troubling implications for a second four years. When      George W. Bush nominated the Princeton economist four years      ago, we offered the backhanded compliment that at least he'd      have to clean up the mess that the Alan Greenspan Fed had      made. That mess turned out to be bigger than even we thought,      but we also didn't know then how complicit Mr. Bernanke was      in Mr. Greenspan's monetary decisions.       Now we do, thanks to the release of the Federal Open Market      Committee transcripts from 2003. They show (see ``Bernanke at      the Creation,'' June 23, 2009) that Mr. Bernanke was the      intellectual architect of the decision to keep monetary      policy exceptionally easy for far too long as the economy      grew rapidly from 2003-2005. He imagined a ``deflation'' that      never occurred, ignored the asset bubbles in commodities and      housing, dismissed concerns about dollar weakness, and in the      process stoked the credit mania that led to the financial      panic.       This, too, might be forgivable if Mr. Bernanke had made any      attempt in recent months to acknowledge the Fed's role in the      mania. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, Dallas Fed President      Richard Fisher and others have conceded that monetary policy      was too loose. How central banks can minimize, if not      prevent, asset bubbles without inducing recessions would seem      to be a subject for candid Fed debate.       But Mr. Bernanke and Vice Chairman Don Kohn have formed an      intellectual moat around the Fed, blaming the credit bubble      on the ``global savings glut'' that they themselves helped to      create. They are the Edith Piafs of central banking,      regretting nothing.       All of this bears directly on how the Fed will operate over      the next four years. We are now in another period of      extraordinary monetary ease. Mr. Bernanke is assuring the      world that, this time, he knows how and when to start      removing this stimulus, even as he also promises that the Fed      will remain easy for months to come. The guideposts the Fed      claims to follow on policy--the jobless rate, ``resource      utilization''--also remain the same. Price signals,      especially the value of the dollar, count for much less in      this Fed's decision-making.       Earlier this decade, the Fed had 20 years of sound-money      history as a source of credibility. The world's investors      were willing to give the Greenspan Fed the benefit of the      doubt--too much doubt as it turned out. But now, after the      mania and panic, investors are unlikely to show such      forbearance. That's already clear in Asia, where the falling      dollar is creating monetary distortions, and investors are      bidding up assets and currencies on a bet that the dollar is      in for further declines. Sooner rather than later, Mr.      Bernanke will have to tighten money even if the U.S. jobless      rate remains higher than everyone would like.       The Fed chairman has shown he knows how to ease money, and      creatively so. But that is the easy part of his job. The hard      part, the time when central bankers earn their fame, is when      they have to take the money away. We see little in the      chairman's policy history or guideposts to suggest he will be      willing to endure the criticism that will come with      tightening money amid a lackluster recovery, if that is what      is required to protect the dollar or prevent an inflation      outbreak.       The political irony today is that even as Mr. Bernanke is      cruising toward confirmation, the Fed as an institution is      under its most sustained political attack in two generations.      The political class is especially riled about the Fed's      forays into fiscal policy. While that is understandable given      the last year, the response to this action should not be to      put the Fed under even greater political control from      Congress. That is the Argentinian solution.       The better response is to hold policy makers accountable      for their actions, including chairmen of the Federal Reserve.      At this monetary moment more than any since the late 1970s,      the Fed needs a hard-money chairman with the courage and      credibility to resist the temptation to escape from the      consequences of the last bubble by floating another one.                                  ____          [From Wall Street Journal Editorial, Jan. 25, 2010]                        The Bernanke Nomination       The politicians turn on a political central banker.       The White House said yesterday it has damped down a      political revolt against Ben Bernanke and now has the votes      to secure the Federal Reserve Chairman's second four-year      term. Whether or not Mr. Bernanke is confirmed, the lesson we      draw is that overly political central bankers will eventually      be undone by politics.       There's no doubt that some of this reconfirmation panic is      nothing but political opportunism. When we opposed Mr.      Bernanke's reconfirmation on December 3, the facile consensus      was that the Fed chief was a master of the universe who had      saved the world from depression. But after Scott Brown's      victory in Massachusetts last week, Senate Democrats are      suddenly looking for a financial political sacrifice.      President Obama doesn't look ready to throw over Treasury      Secretary Tim Geithner, so Mr. Bernanke is the designated      spear catcher.       The Democrats' loudest complaint, moreover, is that Mr.      Bernanke and the Fed haven't been easy enough in printing      money. Majority Leader Harry Reid declared his support for      Mr. Bernanke on Friday, but not before extracting what he      said were concessions about future Fed policy.       The Fed chief promised, said Mr. Reid, that he would      ``redouble his efforts'' to make credit available and that      Mr. Bernanke ``has assured me that he will soon outline plans      for making that happen, and I eagerly await them.''       Redouble? The Fed has already kept interest rates at near      zero for more than a year, and it is buying $1.25 trillion in      mortgage-backed securities to refloat the housing bubble,      among other interventions into fiscal policy and credit      allocation. Is the Fed going to buy another $1.25 trillion,      or promise to keep rates at zero for another 14 months?       Mr. Reid's declaration of a confirmation quid pro quo will      not reassure global investors who already fear that the Fed      lacks the political will to withdraw its historic post-      crisis liquidity binge soon enough to avoid new asset      bubbles.       Our own view is that Mr. Bernanke is already far too      susceptible to political pressure. As a Fed governor, he was      Alan Greenspan's intellectual co-pilot last decade when their      easy money policies created the housing mania. When Congress      later put political pressure on the Fed to direct credit      toward housing, and even to student loans, Mr. Bernanke (who      was then chairman) also quickly obliged.       More ominously for the next four years, Mr. Bernanke      continues to deny any Fed monetary culpability for creating      the mania. Shortly after the New Year, even with his      nomination pending, Mr. Bernanke issued an apologia that was      striking for its willingness to play to the Congressional      theory of the meltdown by blaming bankers and lax regulators.      We won't rehearse our decade-long monetary argument with Mr.      Bernanke today--see ``Bernanke at the Creation,'' June 23,      2009. But the chairman's refusal to acknowledge any mistakes      is one reason the dollar is so weak in global capital      markets. Investors are hedging their bets in commodities and      nondollar assets.       Yes, much of Wall Street wants to see Mr. Bernanke      confirmed. The Street is currently making a bundle off Fed      policy, as it borrows at near-zero rates and lends long, and      the banks don't want that to end. The banks also loved      negative real interest rates in the middle of the last      decade, and we know how that turned out. Wall Street always      loves easy money--until inflation returns, or the bubbles      pop.       Others argue that any alternative to Mr. Bernanke could be      worse, and that is certainly a risk. Mr. Geithner and White      House economic adviser Larry Summers couldn't be confirmed,      even in a Democratic Senate. In the short term if Mr.      Bernanke is defeated, Vice Chairman Donald Kohn might run the      Open Market Committee, and he shares Mr. Bernanke's contempt      for Fed critics. President Obama could also select San      Francisco Fed President Janet Yellen, but she thinks the Fed      should be even easier.       Still, we can think of current or former presidents of      regional Fed banks who have hard money credentials. They      would also not carry the baggage of whatever Harry Reid      extracted as a price of confirmation.       We agree that the Fed needed to ease money precipitously      when the financial markets suffered their heart attack in      late 2008, and we praised Mr. Bernanke for that at the time      and since. But the issue for the next four years is whether      the Fed can extricate itself from its historic interventions      before it creates a new round of boom and bust. We already      see signs that it has waited too long to move.       The Fed as an institution is also under political attack in      a way that it hasn't been since the early 1980s, and that was      when Paul Volcker was being excoriated for being too tight.      That criticism has rarely if ever been leveled at Mr.      Bernanke. The next Fed chairman is going to need the market      credibility, and the political support, to raise interest      rates when much of Congress and Wall Street will be telling      him to stay at zero. That is the real reason to oppose a      second term for Chairman Bernanke.
