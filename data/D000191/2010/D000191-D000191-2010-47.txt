They need better funding. We are on a path now to give them 2 years of certainty whereas before they were hanging on the cliff, and 1 year in the Bush Republican era they ran out of money in June when the fiscal year ends in October, and they were going to close their hospitals. So don't tell me that you guys here are the great defenders of our veterans.  And then this other gentleman raises this thing about this 3-page Republican motion to recommit where people changed their vote. I didn't have to change my vote; I read it. But he might also reveal that that 3-page amendment was only available 1 minute before it was discussed for 10 minutes on the floor. It was not published online. It was not made available to Members, and Members did not know the content of that.  This health care legislation that will be voted on has been online for 72 hours. The manager's amendment is now up online. That Republican amendment was available for a grand total of about 11 minutes before the vote began.  So let's be honest and consistent around here in our arguments, and let's spend a little more time honoring the Greatest Generation.
