President, the last thing I want to do in war is tie our hands, but that is not the issue. We are the most powerful nation history has ever known. This amendment allows us to use antitank mines. It allows us to use claymore mines, to use mines along borders and in demilitarized zones. It simply says let us take a step so we and other countries can get rid of these hidden killers.  The fact of the matter is, Mr. President, the people who are a danger are the agronomists from the University of Virginia or the doctors from the University of Vermont or the missionaries from Tennessee or any other State who try to go to these 60 countries that are infested with mines. They are the ones, they are the ones in danger.  It is usually the civilians who suffer. Face it, is somebody going to march across the Canadian border against the United States or across the Mexican border? It is the child walking down the jungle path who loses a leg. They are who clear landmines an arm and a leg at a time. It is the people in Chechnya who die from them. It is the Afghans, a million and a half of whom are on the border of Pakistan, because they cannot go back to their own country. It is the 100 million landmines that make it impossible for countries to develop. It is the landmines that the president of the International Red Cross speaks about.  It is the landmines that the Pope and the American bishops and so many others are opposed to. What I am asking is that we take a small step, a small step.  I reserve the balance of my time.
