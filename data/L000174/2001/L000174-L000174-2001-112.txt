President, I have a unanimous consent request to which I understand the Senator from Kentucky has agreed.  I ask unanimous consent that the Graham amendment No. 1950 be laid aside, to recur at 4:40 p.m.; that there then be 20 minutes remaining for debate prior to a vote on a motion to table the amendment, with the time to be equally divided and controlled between the Senator from Vermont and the senior Senator from Florida, or their designees; that no second-degree amendment be in order to the Graham amendment prior to a vote on a motion to table; that Senator Feingold now be recognized to offer two amendments, one with respect to Andean drug and one with respect to congressional COLA; that if debate has not concluded on the two Feingold amendments at 4:40 p.m., they be laid aside, to recur upon disposition of the Graham amendment in the order in which they are offered.
