 President, I would like to recognize the City of Chico as they celebrate the 100th Anniversary of Bidwell Park, which is a significant part of Chico's identity and its crown jewel.  Bidwell Park was established in July of 1905 when Annie Bidwell, wife of Chico's founding father, John Bidwell, gave the City 1,902 acres of their ranch, Rancho del Arroyo Chico. Since that time, the City has purchased additional land enlarging the park to its present day size of 3,670 acres, making it the largest municipal park per capita in the United States.  Bidwell Park has a long history with the people of Chico and surrounding areas in Northern California. Some of America's classic movies such as the Adventures of Robin Hood, starring Errol Flynn, Gone with the Wind and Red Badge of Courage were filmed in Bidwell Park using the Park's natural setting and wild landscape as a backdrop.  Today, the City of Chico estimates that there are between 150,000 and 200,000 visits to Bidwell Park every year. Citizens who visit the Park can take advantage of wide-ranging recreational opportunities such as cooling off in one of the countless swimming holes or making the most of approximately 72 miles of trails for hiking, horseback riding and mountain biking.  Bidwell Park also serves as an ideal venue for numerous community events such as Chico's 4th of July Community Celebration held at the One-Mile Recreation Area and the Annual Shakespeare in the Park Series as well as the hundreds of family gatherings, weddings and company picnics.  I would like to especially recognize the work done by the Bidwell Park Centennial Committee and their Co-Chairs Tom Barrett and Chico City Councilmember Ann Schwab for their tireless efforts organizing the scores of events commemorating Bidwell Park's 100th birthday.  I would be remiss if I did not mention the contributions of the Bidwell Park Centennial Supporters and volunteers, especially the Chico Creek Nature Center, for all of their time and resources that illustrate the possibilities that can be realized when public and private interests come together for the benefit of the community.  Again let me say congratulations to the City of Chico and all of the people participating in events celebrating Bidwell Park's centennial year. You should feel proud of all that you are doing and I wish you the very best in the future.                          ____________________[Page S8745]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS                                 ______                                           COMMEMORATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF BIDWELL PARK
