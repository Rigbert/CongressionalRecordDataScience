 President, I would like to begin by recognizing the brave fire and rescue personnel who are working around the clock to stop the spread of fires in California. I know all of our colleagues join me in remembering the more than 40 people who have lost their lives to the blaze, in sympathy for their families and in prayer for all of those whose homes, lives, and livelihoods have been thrown into chaos by this disaster.  As these communities begin the task of rebuilding, Americans everywhere will stand with them.                          ____________________
