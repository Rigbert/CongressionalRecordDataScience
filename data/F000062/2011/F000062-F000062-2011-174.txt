 President, I wish to honor Ramon C. Cortines, his distinguished career and his dedication to improving our Nation's schools. Cortines is retiring today after 55 years in public education.  I know Ramon, or ``Ray,'' as the superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District in Los Angeles, CA--the Nation's second largest school district. I applaud Ray for being a zealous advocate on behalf of the Los Angeles Unified School District and the State of California. His tireless efforts helped to bring Federal funding and reform to its schools, especially during this difficult time of budget cuts and teacher layoffs.  Ray has committed himself to educating young minds. His career started with humble beginnings as a teacher in elementary, middle and high schools. After his first teaching job in Aptos, Ray became a teacher and administrator in Covina, CA.  His career flourished, taking him to administrative positions of principal, assistant superintendent, administrative director and superintendent. Ray became an administrator for 4 years and superintendent of schools for 11 years in Pasadena, CA; superintendent in San Jose, CA, for 2 years; superintendent in San Francisco for 6 years; and New York City Schools chancellor for 2 years.  Ray also recognizes the importance of higher education. He has acted as a consultant to the University of California, the California State University and the California Community College systems.  Ray's leadership didn't stop at the local level. In December 1992, he chaired a U.S. Department of Education transition team for then-President-elect Clinton. Ray served as a senior adviser to former U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley. He was also nominated to serve as Assistant Secretary of Education for Intergovernmental Affairs by President Bill Clinton. He served on numerous task forces and committees with the California Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  Ray isn't afraid to fight for California schools. He has advocated on behalf of teachers and students in California by testifying on Capitol Hill about the importance of increasing funding for title I and special education programs, as well as saving teachers' jobs.  Ray dedicated himself to serving his country in other ways. He served in the U.S. Army from 1953 to 1955.  I admire Ray's hard work, dedication and commitment to raising academic achievement and turning around low-performing schools. As Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent, Ray concentrated on improving instruction and teacher quality. Under his leadership, the district experienced a 16-point increase on the 2010 California Academic Performance Index. The district's overall score topped the 700 threshold for the first time. Ray restructured the first school in the district--Fremont High School. Ray's leadership style is no-nonsense and I applaud him for what he has accomplished.  All of us who care about providing every student with a quality education will miss him.  I congratulate Ray on his years of remarkable service to our Nation and to our State's education system. We are grateful to him for his leadership and commitment to making the classroom a better place for our students. I am sure that his students and colleagues will always remember the impact he made on their lives and their communities.                          ____________________
