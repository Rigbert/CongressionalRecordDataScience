Chairman, I rise today to support H.R. 1275, the Civilian Space Authorization Act, which the Committee on Science recommends to the House by a wide bipartisan margin.  In fiscal year 1998, this bill provides a modest 1-percent increase for NASA over its fiscal 1997 appropriated level. For fiscal year 1999 we provide a 1\1/2\-percent increase over the 1997 level.  As most of the Members will recognize, these increases do not keep pace with inflation, so NASA's real budget continues to fall. Nevertheless, H.R. 1275 provides NASA with the stability it requires to achieve our national space goals during this period of declining budgets.  The bill fully funds NASA's programs and scientific research and includes modest increases in space science data analysis to correct NASA's failures to adequately fund its science investigations.  The bill also contains funding to take our reusable launch vehicle programs to the next level, a generation beyond the X-33 program. X-33 remains our first priority, but this new investment in another X plane concept ensures that the Nation has options for the future of its space transportation capabilities.  I would like to turn now to the bill's international space station provisions.As my colleagues are aware, the Clinton administration invited Russia to join the international space station in 1993.  At the time Congress was skeptical that Russia would make a good partner based upon the instability associated with its transition from communism to democracy and capitalism. But the administration made a lot of promises, arguing that the Russians would never let their space program fall into disrepair, and that we would not be dependent upon the Russians for the success of the international space station.  As most of us know, those promises have been broken. This does not mean that we should walk away from the space station. Its potential to radically improve our knowledge of human physiology, plant and animal biology, microgravity, and material science has been demonstrated time and time again on the space shuttle and in testimony before the Committee on Science. Congress has been right and proper in continuing its support for the international space station, and I hope it continues to do so today.  We have been consistent and passed funding for the space station in the last Congress by 140 vote margins. Our mistake, which we were obligated to make, was to place any faith in the administration's promises. H.R. 1275 fixes that problem.  In committee, the gentleman from California [Mr. Brown] and I offered an amendment that imposes a decision process on the administration relative to the Russian problem and the space station. That amendment was adopted by a unanimous division vote of 25 to nothing.  Briefly, we prohibit paying Russia for its commitments to the international space station. They have to pay for that themselves. United States taxpayers' money will not be used to pay for what the Russians promised to build.  Second, we put an end to the administration's practice of dissembling, denying, and ducking problems by forcing NASA to develop a contingency plan and time line for deciding whether or not to remove each Russian piece of hardware in the critical path.  Third, we require NASA to certify each month that the Russians are, or are not, living up to their obligations, so the administration cannot spring surprises on us and pretend it did not know what was going on.  Fourth, we require the President to certify by August 1 that he will or will not baseline the Russian elements in the Space Station's design.  Finally, long-term stays by our astronauts on the Russian Mir space station require an independent review of the Mir to determine whether it meets or exceeds U.S. safety standards. We cannot risk our astronauts on Mir just to save Russia's dignity or to allow the administration to remain in denial.  I would point out that there is currently a leak of antifreeze on Mir that has caused a partial evacuation of one of the modules of Mir. It does not place our astronauts in a life-threatening situation at the present time, but this is the latest in a long line of safety problems, because the Mir space station has outlived its useful and functional life, and is continuing to be used by the Russians.  The bill is a good package of policy initiatives that will put the space station back on the right track when it comes to dealing with Russia. We are not imposing a solution on the administration, at least not yet. We are not imposing a solution because the committee still hopes to work with the White House to come up with a national solution to this problem.  But we are imposing a decision-making process with deadlines that will force the administration to resolve this problem, and to prevent a hemorrhage of more U.S. taxpayer funds from being unnecessarily used because delaying the problem's resolution will simply increase costs.                              {time}  1245  This reason alone is enough to warrant continuing bipartisan support for H.R. 1275.  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to gentleman from California [Mr. Rohrabacher], chairman of the subcommittee.
