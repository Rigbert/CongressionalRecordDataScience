 I often describe to my constituents that Washington is an island surrounded by reality. Nowhere is this more apparent than with President Obama's February 14 budget. In presenting and defending his budget, President Obama and his staff have said his budget ``lives within our means'' and that ``it will not add to the debt,'' and that ``we are not going to spend any more money than we are taking in.''  Obviously all you have to do is study the budget and you come to the conclusion that these astonishing statements do not equal the facts.
