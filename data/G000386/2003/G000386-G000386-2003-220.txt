 President, we are about to take a historical vote.  Since 1965, Medicare hasn't covered prescription drugs. Now, 38 years later, we're changing that--on a strong bipartisan basis.  Because of this bill, on January 1, 2004, seniors across America will have immediate help with prescription drug costs. Moreover, on January 1, 2006, seniors will have access to affordable, comprehensive drug coverage as a permanent part of Medicare.  No longer will seniors have to make hard choices when it comes to paying for prescription drugs.  This bill also strengthens and improves Medicare, giving seniors more choices and better benefits than they have today.  At the same time, it brings long overdue Medicare equity to the people of Iowa and to other rural States.  We are on the verge of a major victory.  I urge my colleagues to support S. 1.
