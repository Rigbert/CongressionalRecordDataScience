 By doing this--and I see the Senator from Wisconsin in the Chamber--we will be able to move forward. Again, the Senator from Kentucky and I are open to do business. I will have other things to say and will speak on the Andean drug matter, but I remind everybody that we have a huge amount of money in the bill already, and we are cutting a lot of programs that should have higher priority.  I yield the floor.
