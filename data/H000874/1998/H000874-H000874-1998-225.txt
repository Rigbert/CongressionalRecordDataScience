Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the University of Kentucky's men's basketball coach Orlando ``Tubby'' Smith. Let me first point out my allegiance continues to be to the Terrapins of the University of Maryland, as I am sure our Speaker pro tempore's does to the University of Kansas, Roy Williams. But I wanted to take this opportunity to comment on how proud I am of the accomplishments of Tubby Smith in taking the Wildcats of Kentucky to victory and winning Monday's NCAA National Championship in San Antonio, Texas.  Mr. Speaker, I want all of my colleagues to know, particularly the good gentleman from Kentucky, that Tubby Smith comes from my district, Scotland, Maryland, a rural area near Point Lookout where the Chesapeake Bay meets the Potomac River. This community, as you could imagine, now bursts with pride for its native son Tubby Smith, and I am proud to join them in saluting the accomplishments of this distinguished resident.  Tubby Smith was born to Mr. and Mrs. Guffrie and Parthenia Smith 46 years ago, as the 6th eldest child of 17 on a tenant farm in St. Mary's County, Maryland. Guffrie Smith, Sr. held 3 jobs, driving school buses, cutting hair, and firing boilers at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station, to support his family. He and his wife still live today in the five-bedroom home he built on five acres in St. Mary's County.  As to Tubby Smith, after scoring over 3,000 points for the Great Mills High School basketball team, Tubby attended High Point College in North Carolina on a scholarship.                              {time}  2215  He began his coaching career at his alma mater, Great Mills High School, in 1973, and then worked stints as an assistant coach at Virginia Commonwealth and South Carolina. Smith then served under the leadership of Coach Rick Pitino from 1989 to 1991 as an assistant coach at Kentucky University.  His first collegiate head coaching job was with Tulsa University, combining a record of 79-43, while making two NCAA appearances in the Sweet 16. From there, Mr. Speaker, he became the first Georgia State coach to record back-to-back 20 victory seasons.  Then, in May 1997, he was named to replace the legendary Rick Pitino as the head coach of one of the most successful NCAA basketball programs in the country at the University of Kentucky.  Kentucky's Athletic Director Newton learned what Tubby's family and friends also knew, that Tubby would be respected for his outstanding coaching rather than simply as the program's first African-American coach.  In Saint Mary's County, those who know the Smith family are not at all surprised by Tubby's extraordinary accomplishments. They will tell you a heartwarming story of an incredible mother and father who have raised 17 great citizens, who were taught hard work, discipline and the value of good education.  Tubby's accomplishments remind me of the words spoken by Booker T. Washington, who said, ``I have learned that success is to be measured not so much by the position one reached in life as by the obstacles which he has overcome while trying to succeed.''  Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to share with you some of the pride that theSouthern Maryland community has for Tubby Smith and for his family. It is important to learn Tubby's outlook on life, and I quote: ``To never forget where you came from, never forget who you are, and never forget where you are heading.''  I ask all of my colleagues to join with me in congratulating Coach Smith and the Kentucky men's basketball national championship.                          ____________________
