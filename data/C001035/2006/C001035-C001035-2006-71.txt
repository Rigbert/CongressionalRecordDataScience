President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for his leadership on this issue and for his excellent comments. This issue was debated at length yesterday, so I am going to make my comments very brief.  I do oppose Senator Schumer's amendment. I do not think it is practical at this point to require 100 percent scanning of 11 million containers coming into this country. And it ignores the very real improvements that are included in the underlying bill.  I am disappointed to hear the Senator from New York describe our bill as yet another study or yet another pilot project. It is way more than that. It has a layered security system that greatly strengthens the Container Security Initiative, the C-TPAT Program, the automated targeting system. And it includes the provisions we added yesterday at the behest of the Senator from Minnesota that will help us move toward 100 percent scanning when it isfeasible and practical, when the technology is there and able to be in an integrated system.  It also ignores the fact that our bill includes a mandate--a mandate, I would say to the Senator from New York--that the Department of Homeland Security has to install radiological monitors in the 22 busiest ports by the end of next year, which will result in 98 percent of all cargo being screened for radiation, and addresses the issue the Senator has raised about a nuclear bomb or the makings of a dirty bomb.  So this bill does a great deal. I must say, it disappoints me to hear the Senator imply that it does not, even though we disagree on this one particular issue. This has been a bipartisan bill. Senator Murray has worked very hard on it, as well as many of the rest of us.  But let me sum up the problems by reading from a recent letter from the World Shipping Council because I think it really says it best. I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.
