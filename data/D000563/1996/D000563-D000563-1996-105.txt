Chairman, I yield myself my 1 remaining minute.  Mr. Chairman, I hope the Members and those watching this debate are paying close attention. I introduced an amendment which said that it is a Federal crime to possess illegal firearms in public housing projects, or to discharge firearms, except in cases of self-defense. Did Members notice the opposition that came to the floor? What family in America would argue against the proposition that you should keep illegal firearms out of their home and not fire them at will? Yet, when we raise the question of firearms on the floor of this House of Representatives, the gun lobby comes rolling through. You cannot mention those words.  That is mindless. This has nothing to do with the second amendment. This is a question of common sense. American taxpayers who own public housing with the residents and the families who live there need the peace of mind and security that this amendment will bring. I hope that my colleagues will push aside the gun lobby once and forever, and say when it comes to illegal firearms, we do not want them in public housing projects. We do not want them anywhere.
