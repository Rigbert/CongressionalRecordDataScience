 President, this is that time at the end of a Congress when inevitably some of our Members go on to something else and leave this body. I want to take this opportunity this morning to pay tribute to another distinguished Member of the Senate who is leaving us at the end of this year.  Senator Bob Corker is one of the most hard-working and, frankly, relentless Members of this body. He is a builder by trade and a fixer by nature. Senator Corker is always a man on a mission. Our distinguished colleague hails from a State with a long history of impressive Senators. Tennesseans such as Howard Baker, Al Gore, Bill Frist, and, of course, our colleague Lamar Alexander all developed national reputations as leaders. But after 12 years of working with Bob, I could not feel more comfortable saying that he himself will now become a part of that great Tennessee legacy. He has met that high bar, and he set it high himself.  No sooner could any Senator turn his or her attention to some important but stalled initiative--some dead-end negotiation, some thorny national problem--then you would see Bob Corker diving into the fray and attacking the problem with everything he had.
