Speaker, this year we remember the 65th Anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp by U.S. Armed Forces. After Auschwitz opened in 1940 the Nazi army wasted little time in rounding up Polish prisoners for imprisonment at this killing field.  Auschwitz-Birkenau, also known as Auschwitz II, was the largest killing center of all. SS authorities established it in the spring of 1942. It was not subordinated to the regional SS, but was part of the SS Economic-Administration Main Office.  ``Block 10'' was where the Nazis, including Mengele, the ``Angel of Death,'' conducted unspeakable medical experiments on prisoners and ``Block 11'' was where people were lined up against a wall and shot.  Before the death camp's liberation on January 27, 1945, almost a million Jews from Poland and adjoining nations died there along with 21,000 Roma (gypsies) and countless homosexuals, communists and Soviet and Ukrainian POWs. At least 75,000 Poles were summarily executed. When all acts of horror ceased, the Nazis had murdered 1.1 million people at this site.  Mr. Marian Wojciechowski, a constituent and lifelong friend of mine, is a survivor of Auschwitz and Block 11. He served as an officer in the Polish cavalry and bravely fought Nazi tanks as they rolled into his homeland of Poland near the Czech border as World War II began on September 1, 1939.  He and colleagues in his unit fought with such valor against the invaders they wereawarded Poland's highest military medal, the Virtuti Militari. On September 17, 1939, while in battle on the eastern front against the Soviet Army, he received a bullet wound to the head--but Marian survived.  For two years, Marian joined as a member of the Polish Underground Resistance (Armia Krajowa), which worked closely with British and Polish intelligence to defeat the Nazis. Their bravery and sacrifice made them a prime target for the German Gestapo. He was captured and taken to Auschwitz when a letter from a member of the Underground Resistance addressed to him was intercepted by the Germans.  While a prisoner at Radom and then Auschwitz, Marian was brutally beaten, tortured, and subjected to nightmarish conditions. He became very ill and survived serious illness, even typhus. At times, he was beaten so severely that he would lose consciousness. The Nazis would revive him by pouring buckets of water on his head, and once he regained his senses, the Nazis would beat him some more to gain information about the Underground--but miraculously Marian survived.  Marian, now 95 years of age and commissioned as Lieutenant in the Polish Cavalry this past August during WWII commemorative ceremonies at Mokra, Poland, has described some of the horrific acts that he witnessed in that horrible place.  Amazingly Mr. Wojciechowski did what 1.1 million innocents were unable to do--he survived Auschwitz. He has taken it upon himself to be a keeper of the flame of historical remembrance as contained in the book, ``Seven Roads to Freedom''. His is a story of exceptional resilience, strength and the triumph of the human spirit, and love of liberty. As we reflect on the horrors of World War II, the Holocaust, and the Auschwitz concentration camp we honor and remember stories like his, mourn the stories which were never told, and reflect on the price of freedom.                          ____________________
