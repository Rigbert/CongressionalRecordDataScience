Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. I think it is noteworthy that this is being sponsored and spoken for primarily by the freshman Republicans in this House of Representatives. Those who have followed their agenda over the last year and a half will not be surprised that they would come out for an amendment to end AmeriCorps.  This amendment is mean-spirited. This amendment is cynical. This amendment says to young men and women who are willing to give a year or two of their lives in public service for the lowest wages, with the chance at the end of it that they will get a $5,000 scholarship, they are saying that this is wasteful. Wasteful. Wasteful, that these young men and women would take the personal responsibility for their own lives and futures, and be willing to give back to this country?  Mr. Chairman, this is the same spirit that motivated the Peace Corps under President Kennedy, to say to young men and women, step forward, serve your country, do something, and we will be proud of you, and you will be proud of your experience. But these freshman Republicans will hear none of that. For them, it is a liberal boondoggle. They have forgotten, many of them, how many times they have had to turn to the Government for college student loans.  We should vote against this amendment and stand up for the idealism that this program represents.
