 Sally was awarded the John W. McCormack Annual Award of Excellence for Service to the House. Without Sally Crowe, life in this building would have ground to a halt in many respects. Now it won't grind to a halt, it won't grind to a halt because we are advantaged by so many who care for this institution. And we thank them all.  But today, we remember a wonderful, decent, good, loving human being, our friend, Sally Crowe. God rest her soul.                Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore
