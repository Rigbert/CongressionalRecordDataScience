Speaker, I recall Speaker Gingrich's initiative this evening called Correction Days. The idea was to do away with congressional business as usual and make government more responsive to our people.  Mr. Speaker, I fear today and tomorrow may be the opposite of Corrections Day. They could be renamed Special Interest Days. Maybe we will need another Corrections Day to undo the damage we think is being done as the House completes its regular business, passes its respective appropriations bills, and finally recesses.  I am speaking in particular of the continuing resolution about to emerge from behind closed doors and being worked on by the leaders of one side of this Chamber.  Mr. Speaker, the special interests know full well that Members of Congress are eager to wrap up and get back home and prepare for the upcoming election. So they have lined up, it appears, so they can speak their special provisions into law at the last minute in the continuing resolution, because they know we have to pass that in order to keep the Government running.  We used to have Howard Metzenbaum as the watchdog over on the other side, but we have heard rumors, in fact, that patent law protections might be undermined by some provisions being inserted by one of the Members in the other body.  This afternoon, and I am going to insert this in the Record for our colleagues, the Associated Press reported that certain companies are trying to skirt ``Made in the U.S.A.'' laws by sneaking special provisions into the continuing resolution. Let me read the first sentence, the lead sentence, in fact, to a story written by AP congressional writer Jim Drinkard.  He writes:       Lobbyists for one of America's largest toolmakers are      seeking a last-minute congressional deal that would allow      them to continue marketing wrenches and other tools forged in      foreign countries as made in the U.S.A.  Let me repeat. This is from the Associated Press. It says that this particular toolmaker is seeking to put language in this bill that would allow them to continue marketing wrenches and other tools made in other countries under the ``Made in the U.S.A.'' label.  That is not what is supposed to be in this bill. Not only is it nongermane to the continuing resolution, it is also false advertising. It is not only an abuse of the legislative process, sneaking through special interest provisions in the closing hours of the session, it is unfair to American workers, because skirting ``Made in America'' laws kills American jobs.  Mr. Speaker, we have many skilled workers in our country whose future depends on strong and competitive machine tool industries. We do not want to be undercutting them just to cut a special deal for a special interest. But according to the AP, Stanley Works, headquartered in New Britain, CT, sells tools that were cast or forged in foreign plants.  Federal courts have required that tools made in foreign countries had to bear markings showing where they came from, so someone from Toledo, or any other community who wants to buy some tools, will know whether those tools were made in our country by American workers or whether they were made in a foreign country.  That was not good enough for Stanley Works, it appears. They want to sell their tools to the consumer without revealing the true origin of those tools. That is misleading to the American consumer, it is unfair to American workers, and special interests appear to be lined up to do an end run around our ``Made in America'' laws right in the continuing resolution.  Mr. Speaker, ``Made in America'' laws help keep American workers employed. They help keep the orders coming in and jobs alive. They should not be eviscerated in a last-minute congressional deal to placate a special interest.  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record the article by Mr. Drinkard.  The article referred to is as follows:   Endgame of a Congress: Tightening the Screws on Federal Regulators                           (By Jim Drinkard)       Washington (AP) Lobbyists for one of America's largest      toolmakers are seeking a last-minute congressional deal that      would allow them to continue marketing wrenches and other      tools forged in foreign countries as ``Made in the U.S.A.''       It's an example of how in the frenzied endgame of a      congressional session, special-interest provisions that have      lain dormant for months suddenly take on new life as their      backers seek to attach them to any bill that moves.       In this case, there is ``only one train leaving the      station,'' in congressional parlance the omnibus money bill      needed to keep the government running once the new fiscal      year begins Tuesday. That bill has become a magnet for pet      amendments ranging from gun control to banking regulatory      changes.       The Stanley Works, based in New Britain, Conn., sells tools      that in many cases were cast or forged in overseas plants.      Customs rules for years have allowed them to be imported and      finished in the U.S., then sold without markings showing the      country where the parts originated.       But a Federal court ruling four years ago upset that      arrangement. It required that some foreign-origin tools had      to bear markings showing where they came from, because the      final product was substantially the same as the imported      items. That triggered the current lobbying scramble.       Lobbyists for Stanley began angling to attach their      provision to the money measure, and lobbyists for their      competitors laid trip wires around Capitol Hill to head them      off.       ``This reflects an intra-industry war,'' said Rep. Nancy      Johnson, R-Conn, who has gone to bat for Stanley, a large      home-state employer.       A lawyer for the company, Stave Weddle, said Customs is      ``particularly unwise to be making a change when the whole      area of country-of-origin labeling is being addressed by the      World Trade Association,'' which may reach a different      conclusion.       The saga began several years ago, when National Hand Tool      Corp., a Stanley division, sought to import socket wrenches      made in Taiwan without stamping them with the name of the      country. The company argued that the tools were heat-tempered      and further machined in the United States, so they were      primarily U.S. made.       But the Customs Service ruled otherwise, saying that the      tools had not been ``substantially transformed'' in the      United States. That meant they were required to be marked as      made in Taiwan. The tool company appealed, but lost in      federal court.       Against that backdrop, Customs announced last year that it      planned to update its rules to codify the court's ruling and      make clearer which imported tools had to be marked with the      country where they originated.       For Stanley, the announcement was like a hammer blow; it      had built a network of suppliers in several foreign      countries, relying in part on a series of Customs rulings      that permitted it to label the final tools as made in the      United States. Any change would threaten its marketing,      which emphasizes quality homegrown products.       In the first six months of the year, Stanley paid a      Washington law and lobbying firm about $120,000 to advocate      its position on Capitol Hill, and paid another lobbyist      $12,100, according to lobbying disclosure reports.       In May, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, introduced a bill that      would have let toolmakers market their goods as made in the      United States, even if the metal parts were made abroad. It      amounted to a blanket exemption from the foreign-marking      requirement.       Johnson inserted a similar provision into a catchall trade      ``technical corrections'' bill that passed the House. That      language would simply have barred Customs from issuing any      new regulations for at least a year while the entire spectrum      of regulations on labeling of imports is studied.       ``If you change it for one product, it has enormous      implications for other products,'' Johnson said. ``Customs is      overreaching.''       But Danaher Corp., a competing toolmaker with plants across      the United States, countered by hiring the law firm Hogan &      Hartson for $100,000, and the lobbying firm WinCapitol for      $220,000, both to help torpedo the provision.       To strengthen its hand Hogan & Hartson formed the American      Hand Tool Coalition,     which says it represents 10 companies with manufacturing      plants in 13 states.       Johnson said she had enlisted high-powered help from Senate      Majority Leader Trent Lott and from the two lawmakers with      the most say on trade policy: House Ways and Means Committee      Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, and Senate Finance Committee      Chairman William Roth, R-Del.       Using the threat of a legislative mandate as pressure, the      issue may well be resolved ``in a side discussion with      Customs,'' she said.                          ____________________
