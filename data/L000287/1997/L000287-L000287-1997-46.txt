Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of Atlanta and the Fifth District of Georgia, I rise to pay tribute to a beautiful and gracious woman, Princess Diana. With beauty, dignity, and grace, she saw suffering, she saw pain, and she did something about it.  Leading a crusade of love and compassion, Princess Diana put a face on people suffering from AIDS. She comforted the sick and the poor. As she helped war-ravaged children in Angola, she focused the world's attention on the devastation of landmines. As the public gazed on her, Princess Diana opened our eyes and our hearts.  Today, we mourn for her family, especially her two young sons, but we also mourn for all of humankind, because the world has very few Dianas.  We are more than lucky. As members of the human family, we are blessed to have known this beautiful person.  Mr. Speaker, our hearts are heavy from this tragic loss. The world is a darker and colder place without the radiance of Princess Diana.  We will miss you. Rest in peace, Sweet Princess.                          ____________________
