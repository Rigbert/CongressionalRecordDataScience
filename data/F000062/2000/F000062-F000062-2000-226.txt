 President. I am pleased to introduce this bill today to assist Katy Gill, the owner of KATY radio, a station broadcasting out of a one acre parcel of the San Bernardino Forest and acting as an important public service announcement source for the residents of Idylwood, California.  KATY radio has been caught up in some unfortunate circumstances involving an antennae site that the station had at one time, been leasing from GTE. When GTE decided to move out of the area, KATY was no longer able to legally operate. This bill will allow KATY to purchase at fair market value the title to 1.06 acres of land in San Bernardino National Forest so that the station could continue broadcasting.  This legislation is supported by the Forest Service and KATY radio station listeners throughout Idylwood, California. I know of no opposition to such legislation. Representatives Mary Bono, Jerry Lewis and Don Young have introduced similar legislation in the House. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and the relevant Senate committee members to ensure that we address this issue before the end of the 106th Congress.                                 ______                                       By
