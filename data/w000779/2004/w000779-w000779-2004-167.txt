President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator Smith in introducing a bill to waive all statutory time limitations so that Colonel Rex T. Barber, of Terrebonne, OR may be posthumously awarded a Medal of Honor.  Colonel Rex T. Barber was a World War II fighter pilot who risked his life to shoot down Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, the Commander in Chief of the Combined Japanese Fleet and architect of the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Our bill not only waives the statutory time limitations applying to the Medal of Honor, but also requests that the President posthumously award the medal to this deserving man.  On April 18, 1943, Barber, then a first lieutenant in the 399th Fighter Squadron of the South Pacific Air Forces, Army Air Corps, undertook a top secret mission to shoot down Yamamoto. Barber successfully attacked a bomber transporting Yamamoto despite heavy counterattacks by Japanese fighters escorting the admiral. Upon return to base, Barber found more than 100 holes in his aircraft. Admiral Yamamoto's plane crashed in flames, killing Yamamoto and his crew.  This brave exploit of Colonel Barber is well-documented, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Oregon delegation, the Congress, and ultimately the President, to see that his bravery is formally recognized.  I ask unanimous consent that the text to the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2039       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. AUTHORITY FOR AWARD OF THE MEDAL OF HONOR TO REX                    T. BARBER FOR VALOR DURING WORLD WAR II.       (a) Waiver of Time Limitations.--Notwithstanding the time      limitations in section 3744 of title 10, United States Code,      or any other time limitation applicable with respect to the      awarding of certain medals to     persons who served in the Air Force, the President is      authorized and requested to award the Medal of Honor      posthumously under section 3741 of that title to Colonel      (retired) Rex T. Barber, United States Air Force, of      Terrebonne, Oregon, for the acts of valor referred to in      subsection (b).       (b) Action Described.--The acts of valor referred to in      subsection (a) are the conspicuous acts of gallantry and      intrepidity of Rex T. Barber at the risk of his life and      beyond the call of duty on April 18, 1943, while serving as a      first lieutenant in the 339th Fighter Squadron of the South      Pacific Air Forces, Army Air Corps, in successfully attacking      and shooting down the enemy bomber aircraft transporting      Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, the Commander in Chief of the      Combined Japanese Fleet and architect of Japan's attack on      Pearl Harbor.                          ____________________
