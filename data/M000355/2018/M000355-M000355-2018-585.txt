 President, on another matter, later this afternoon, the Senate will vote to advance the nomination of Charles Rettig to serve as Commissioner of the IRS. Mr.Rettig's nomination comes at a crucial time, as the Federal Government continues to implement once-in-a-generation tax reform.  Recent memory reminds us just how important it is that all Americans get a fair shake from the agency that oversees the Tax Code. This historic new law makes it all the more important that the IRS continue to modernize and improve its technological infrastructure.  So I look forward to this nominee's getting to work on behalf of the American taxpayers.                          ____________________
