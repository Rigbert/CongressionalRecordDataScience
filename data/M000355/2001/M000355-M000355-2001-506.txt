 President, I would like to read into the Record the following article by Stanford law professor Kathleen Sullivan, entitled ``Paying Up Is Speaking Up.'' In it, she notes that politics and political campaigns are far cleaner today than they were in the days of Tammany Hall. She also notes that in Bucklay v. Valeo the Supreme Court made things worse by striking down expenditure limits while upholding contribution units, resulting in a situation where government may limit the supply of political money but not the demand.  Professor Sullivan says:       Those who claim that our political system is awash in      money, corruption and influence peddling were predictably      upset that the Senate again defeated the campaign finance      restriction proposed by Senators Russell Feingold and John      McCain. The Senate's failure to ban ``soft money''--large      contributions to political parties that are made to avoid      tight restrictions on donations to candidates--drew      laments from editorial pages to corporate boardrooms,      where some business executives now plead, ``Stop us before      we spend again.''       The advocates of new, improved campaign finance reform are      well-intentioned but misguided. Of course none of us wishes      to live in a plutocracy, where wealth alone determines      political clout. But as Senator Mitch McConnell noted in a      heated exchange with Senator McCain, American politics today      is far from ``corrupt'' in the traditional sense. And the      most troubling features of political fund-raising today are      the unintended consequences of earlier efforts at campaign      finance reform.       Begin with the allegations of ``corruption.'' Contributions      to candidates and parties today do not line anybody's      pockets, as they did in the heyday of machines like Tammany      Hall. Vigilant media and law enforcement now nip improper      personal enrichment in the bud, as politicians involved in      the savings and loan scandals found out to their detriment.       Political money today instead goes directly into political      advertising, a quintessential form of political speech. Our      large electoral districts and weak political parties force      candidates to communicate directly with large groups of      voters. This depends on the use of the privately owned mass      media. Thus getting the candidate's message out is expensive.       Reformers sometimes decry today's political advertising as      repetitious and reductive. But it is not clear what golden      age of high-minded debate they hark back to; the antecedents      of the spot ad are, after all, the bumper sticker and slogans      like ``Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too.''       Nor is there any doubt that restrictions on political money      amount to restrictions on political speech. Reformers      sometimes say they merely seek to limit money, not speech.      But a law, say, barring newspapers from accepting paid      political advertisements or limiting the prices of political      books would also limit only the exchange of money. Yet no one      would question that it would inhibit political speech--as do      restrictions on campaign finance.       Unfortunately, the Supreme Court only half recognized this      point when, in 1976, it struck down limits on political      expenditures while upholding limits on political gifts.      Expenditures, the Court reasoned, may not be limited in order      to level the playing field, but political contributions may      be limited to prevent the reality or appearance that big      contributors will have disproportionate influence. So we      still have in place the 1974 law limiting individual      contributions to a Federal candidate to $1,000 per election--     the equivalent of about $383 in 1999 dollars--and,      perversely, candidates must spend ever more time chasing an      ever larger number of donors.       The Court's noble but flawed attempt at compromise leaves      us in the worst of all possible worlds: government may limit      the supply of political money but not the demand. This is a      situation that in a commercial setting would produce a black      or gray market, and politics is no different. Instead of      money flowing directly to candidates, it flows to parties as      soft money, or to independent advocacy organizations for      issue ads that often     imply support for or opposition to specific candidates.       Political spending and speech thus have been shifted away      from the candidates, who are accountable to the voters, to      organizations that are much harder for the voters to monitor      and discipline--a result that turns democracy on its head.       Reform proposals such as McCain-Feingold proceed on the      assumption that the answer is to keep on shutting down      ``loopholes'' in the system. But in a system of private      ownership and free expression, we can never shut all the      loopholes down. If the wealthy cannot bankroll campaigns,      they can buy newspapers or set up lobbying organizations that      will draft legislation rather than campaign ads. When the      cure has been worse than the disease, the solution is not      more doses of the same medicine.       Does this mean we should eliminate all campaign finance      regulation? Certainly not. Even if we give up on contribution      limits, we should retain and enhance mandatory disclosure and      public subsidies--two kinds of government intervention that      are consistent with both democracy and the Constitution.       Mandatory disclosure of the amounts and sources of      political contributions enables the voters themselves, aided      by the press, to follow the money and hold their      representatives accountable if they smell the foul aroma of      undue influence. Such disclosure is an extraordinarily      powerful and accessible tool in the age of the Internet.       And more widespread public subsidies, like those now given      in presidential and some state races, could, if given early      in campaigns, help political challengers reach the critical      threshold amounts they need to get their messages out.       In ongoing debates about campaign finance reform, it is      worth remembering that free speech principles bar the      creation of ceilings on political money, but they do not bar      the raising of floors.  Mr. President, I would also like to read into the Record a recent article by Stuart Taylor Jr. of the National Journal entitled ``How McCain-Feingold Would Constrict Speech.'' It explains how McCain-Feingold would make our political system worse, not better. It notes that each new step down the road of restricting political speech and political spending actually creates new problems.  Mr. Taylor's article says:       It all sounds so clean, so wholesome, so righteous: close      the loopholes in our campaign finance laws. End what Sen.      John McCain, R-Ariz., calls the ``corrupting chase for      `soft money.' '' Curb the influence of corporations and      labor unions. Stop special interests from polluting our      politics with ``sham issue ads.'' Mandate greater public      disclosure of political spending.       But in reality, the McCain-Feingold-Cochran campaign      finance bill would make our politics worse, not better, by      further entrenching incumbents against challengers, by      weakening our political parties, by increasing the influence      of wealthy individuals and huge media corporations, by      stifling political debate, and by attacking the First      Amendment's premise that political speech should be free and      uninhibited, not hobbled by a maze of prohibitions and      regulations.       We might be able to make our politics cleaner and fairer by      supplementing private campaign funding with some form of      public financing to help give voice to candidates and causes      with scant financial resources. (More on that next week.) We      will not achieve this by piling onerous new restrictions on      privately funded speech.       Our experience with the current curbs on campaign      contributions, which were enacted in the early 1970s, should      be sobering. Spread through hundreds of pages of almost      indecipherable legalese understood only by specialists, these      curbs are filled with traps, technicalities, and      opportunities for selective enforcement by politically      appointed bureaucrats and judges. Their main impact has been      to force federally elected officials and their challengers to      spend a huge percentage of their waking hours soliciting      ever-smaller (after inflation) contributions from ever-larger      numbers of people. Meanwhile, incumbents have become harder      to defeat, the influence of special interests has grown,      voter turnout has declined, and public confidence in our      political system has plunged.       The solution, say McCain and other ``reformers,'' is to      plug loopholes in the current laws--first and foremost, by      ending the ability of wealthy individuals, corporations, and      unions to circumvent the limits on ``hard-money''      contributions to candidates by giving their political parties      unlimited sums of soft money to be spent promoting the      candidates. This would make it harder for politicians to      extort money from those who would prefer not to give. That is      good. But it would also weaken the parties' ability to      finance indisputably healthy grass-roots activities such as      voter education, registration, and turnout drives, while      spurring the many companies, unions, and individuals who want      to be active in politics to take their money elsewhere. That      is very bad.       The most obvious outlet for private money would be to fund      so-called issue advertisements praising their preferred      candidates and attacking their adversaries, either directly      or by giving to one or more of the interest groups that buy      such ads. These groups range from the Chamber of Commerce,      the National Right to Life Committee, and the National Rifle      Association on the right to labor unions, Planned Parenthood,      and the Sierra Club on the left. Such a governmentally      engineered shift of money and power from the parties--our      most broad-based vehicles for citizen participation in      politics--to single-issue groups and other ideologically      driven organizations would warp our political discourse.       Not to worry, McCain and his allies say, we also have a      plan to curb the financial clout of corporations, unions, and      independent interest groups. This proposal (Title II of the      bill) would severely restrict such organizations' spending on      issue ads and other activities designed to disparage or      promote federal candidates. Indeed, for some incumbents      facing re-election battles, these provisions are the main      attraction of the McCain-Feingold-Cochran bill. ``We're      totally defenseless against the juggernaut of huge,      unregulated, undisclosed expenditures'' by independent      groups, Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., who faces an election      next year, told the Wall Street Journal.       This part of the bill would, in the words of Brooklyn Law      School professor Joel M. Gora, who has long worked with the      American Civil Liberties Union on campaign finance issues,      ``effectively silence a great deal of issue speech and      advocacy by non-partisan citizen groups, organizations, labor      unions, corporations, and individuals.'' It would altogether      bar for-profit corporations and unions from buying television      or radio ads, or giving independent groups money to buy ads,      that so much as mention--let alone criticize or praise--a      federal candidate during the critical 60 days before an      election and the 30 days before any primary. These are      precisely the periods during which the public is most      attentive to debate about political issues and candidates.      The bill would also prohibit independent groups from buying      such pre-election issue ads unless they set up unwieldy      separate, segregated funds that shun corporate and union      money and publicly disclose all individual contributions      above $1,000.       An even more radical provision would expose such groups to      possible legal sanctions if they do anything, at any time,      that might help any candidate with whom they have      ``coordinated''--a term defined so broadly and vaguely as to      encompass almost any contacts with candidates or their      aides--in working on issues of mutual interest. So      restrictive are these ``coordination'' rules that some of      McCain-Feingold-Cochran's biggest champions might have run      afoul of them had they been in effect during the 1999-2000      election cycle. Common Cause, for example, worked closely      (``coordinated'') with McCain in late 1999 on strategies for      promoting his bill, while spending lots of its own soft money      touting the bill (and McCain) to the public, at a time when      McCain himself was putting campaign finance reform at the      center of his presidential candidacy. Under his own bill,      such routine political activities involving Common Cause and      McCain might be deemed illegal corporate campaign      contributions.       Nor is McCain-Feingold-Cochran's requirement that      independent groups disclose the names of all donors of more      than $1,000 for pre-election issue ads as innocuous as it may      seem. It is, some independent groups argue, mainly for the      benefit not of the public, but of powerful incumbents and      other politicians who might use pressure and intimidation to      deter people from funding issue ads the politicians don't      like. Thus could a bill that purports to curb the influence      of Big Money in politics have the effect of increasing the      power of politicians to silence critics both big and small.       Fortunately, McCain-Feingold-Cochran's proposed      restrictions on issue ads and independent groups will have      trouble getting through Congress now that the AFL-CIO is      opposing them--a major break with its usual Democratic      allies. And even if enacted, these restrictions have little      chance of surviving judicial review. They fly in the face of      rules laid down by the Supreme Court in a long line of First      Amendment decisions that guarantee that issue advocacy by      independent groups, corporations, and unions will enjoy broad      protection from all forms of official regulation, including      public disclosure requirements.       In any event, any portion of McCain-Feingold-Cochran that      manages to get through Congress and past the courts would not      take Big Money out of politics. The bill would, rather,      increase the relative power of those moneyed interests that      remain unregulated. These would include individuals rich      enough to finance their own campaigns, such as Ross Perot,      Steve Forbes, and the four Senate candidates (all Democrats)      who each spent more than $5 million of their own money to win      their races. This group was topped by Jon Corzine's $60      million purchase of a seat to represent New Jersey. Power      would also flow to the national news media, which are owned      by huge corporations such as AOL-Time Warner and General      Electric, are staffed by journalists with their own biases,      and are busily clamoring for restrictions on the campaign-     related spending and First Amendment rights of everybody      else.       Those reformers who are most serious about driving Big      Money out of politics see McCain-Feingold-Cochran as only a      first, tiny step. They would also cap campaign spending by      wealthy candidates--a step that would require overruling the      Supreme Court's landmark 1976 decision in Buckley vs. Valeo.      And a few reformers have asserted that, in the words of      associate professor     Richard L. Hazen of Loyola University Law School in Los      Angeles: ``The principle of political equality means that the      press, too, should be regulated when it editorializes for or      against candidates.''       Each new step down this road of restricting political      spending and speech creates new problems and new inequities,      fueling new demands to close ``loopholes'' by adding ever-     more-sweeping restrictions. How far might campaign finance      reformers go if they could have their way? Was McCain serious      when he said on Dec. 21, 1999. ``If I could think of a way      constitutionally, I would ban negative ads''? Shades of the      Alien and Sedition Acts.       Politics will always be a messy business. Money will always      talk. And the cure of legislating political purity and      purging private money will always be worse than the disease.  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to read into the Record an article by Judge James Buckley entitled ``Campaign Finance: Why I Sued in 1974.'' Judge Buckley was the lead plaintiff in the landmark campaign finance case of Buckley v. Valeo. This article provides an important historical context to the current debate over restricting Campaign finances further.  It says:       Twenty-five years ago, I was a member of the Senate      majority that voted against the legislation that gave us the      present limitations on campaign contributions. Having lost      the debate on the floor, I did what any red-blooded      American does these days: I took the fight to the courts      as lead plaintiff in Buckley v. Valeo. This is the case in      which the Supreme Court held that the 1974 act's      restrictions on campaign spending were unconstitutional      but that its limits on contributions were permissible in      light of Congress's concern over the appearance of      impropriety.       The issue of campaign finance is again before the Senate.      Unfortunately, today's reformers are apt to make a badly      flawed system even worse.       To understand why, it is instructive to take a look at the      Buckley plaintiffs. I had squeaked into office as the      candidate of New York's Conservative Party. My co-plaintiffs      included Sen. Eugene McCarthy, whose primary challenge caused      President Lyndon Johnson to withdraw his bid for re-election;      the very conservative American Conservative Union; the      equally liberal New York Civil Liberties Union; the      Libertarian Party; and Stewart Mott, a wealthy backer of      liberal causes who had contributed $200,000 to the McCarthy      presidential campaign. We were a group of political underdogs      and independents; and although we spanned the ideological      spectrum, we shared a deep concern that the 1974 act would      dramatically increase the difficulties already faced by those      challenging incumbents and the political status quo.       Incumbents enjoy formidable advantages, including name      recognition, access to the media, and the goodwill gained      from handling constituent problems. A challenger, on the      other hand, must persuade both the media and potential      contributors that his candidacy is credible. This can require      a substantial amount of seed money. As we testified, Sen.      McCarthy could not have launched a serious challenge to a      sitting president and I could not have won election as a      third-party candidate under the present law. Large      contributions from a few early supporters established us as      viable candidates. Once the media took us seriously, we were      able to reach out to our natural constituencies for financial      support and to attract the cadres of volunteers that      characterized our campaigns.       Although we won a number of the arguments we presented in      Buckley, we lost the critical one when the court held that      the limits on contributions were constitutional. Experience,      however, has vindicated our worries over the practical      consequences of these and other provisions of the 1974 act.       The legislation was supposed to de-emphasize the role of      money in federal elections and encourage broader      participation in the political process. Instead, by limiting      the size of individual contributions, it has made fund      raising the central preoccupation of incumbents and      challengers alike; and it created a bureaucracy, the Federal      Election Commission, that has issued regulations governing      independent spending that are so complex and have made the      costs of a misstep so great that grassroots action has      virtually disappeared from the political scene. Today, anyone      intrepid enough to engage in such activities is well advised      to hire a lawyer; and even then, he must be prepared to      engage in protracted litigation to prove his independence.       Legislation that was supposed to democratize the political      process has served instead to reinforce the influence of the      political establishment. By compounding the difficulties      faced by challengers, it has consolidated the advantages of      incumbency and increased the power of the two major parties.      By limiting individual contributions to $1,000, it has      enhanced the political clout of both business and union      political action committees--the notorious PACs.       Moreover, if today's reformers succeed in their efforts to      restrict ``issue advocacy,'' the net effect will be to      increase the already formidable power of the media. The New      York Times or The Wall Street Journal will be free to throw      their enormous influence behind a particular candidate or      cause through Election Day. But public interest groups would      be denied the right to advertise their disagreement with the      Times or the Journal during the final weeks of a campaign.       What is needed is not more restrictions on speech but a re-     examination of the premises underlying the existing ones.      Recent races have exploded the myth that money can ``buy'' an      election. Ask Michael Huffington, who lost his Senate bid in      California after spending $28 million. The voters always have      the final say. What money can buy is the exposure challengers      need to have a chance. And while large contributions can      corrupt, studies of voting patterns confirm that that concern      in vastly overstated. The overwhelming majority of wealthy      donors back candidates with whom they already agree, and they      are far more tolerant of differences on this point or that      than are the PACs to which a candidate will otherwise turn.       An alternative safeguard against corruption is readily      available--the daily posting of contributions on the      Internet. This would enable voters to judge whether a      particular contributions might corrupt its recipient. What      makes no sense is to retain a set of rules that make it      impossible for a Stewart Mott to provide a Eugene McCarthy      with the seed money for a challenge to a sitting president,      or that make elective politics the playground of the super      rich.       The problem today is not that too much money is spent on      elections. Proctor & Gamble spends more in advertising than      do all political campaigns and parties in an election cycle.      The problem is that the electoral process is saddled by a      tangle of laws and regulations that restrict the ability of      citizens to make themselves heard and that rig the political      game in favor of the most privileged players. And because      congressional incumbents are the beneficiaries of the titled      playing field, it is fanciful to believe that Congress will      re-write the rule book to give outsiders an even break.       We have nothing to fear from unfettered political debate      and everything to gain. American democracy can ill afford      government control of the political marketplace; but that is      where today's reformers would lead us.                               ____________________
