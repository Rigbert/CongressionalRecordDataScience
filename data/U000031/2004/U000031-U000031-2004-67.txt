Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Tri-County Head Start Director Orion Flowers, who is approaching the end of a long and distinguished career of public service. A dedicated and committed individual, Orion has served the communities and children of southwest Michigan for over 30 years. Through his leadership as Director, Orion helped the program grow from serving 100 to 1026 children.  Since becoming Head Start Director in 1970, Orion devotedly and selflessly committed himself to the betterment of countless families. Orion is widely known for his extensive charity and dedication to local individuals and the community as a whole. He spent a career devoted to improving the lives of the citizens of southwest Michigan, and the area is forever in his debt. There is no question that Orion's dedication and contributions to the Tri-County will be missed.  One example of Orion's diligent work occurred in the early 1970's, when he initiated a program whereby children would come to a Mobile Unit for classes. In conjunction with that, a Home Based program began where a Home Visitor would go into a family's home to assist parents in teaching their children an array of subjects and concerns. Remarkably the Mobile Unit and Home Based concepts are still in use today.  Many words come to mind as one reflects upon Orion Flower's public service to our community. He is selfless, generous, giving, caring, humble . . . the list goes on. Our community is in debt to Orion Flowers for his continued public service since 1970. I wish him and his family all the best in retirement. Orion's contributions to our community have been many, and we are all better off because of his service. He will be truly missed by the folks in southwest Michigan.                          ____________________
