 I rise in support of the Waters TIGER grant amendment. I agree with the gentlelady that there's no stronger job creator than investment in transportation: Bridges, transit systems, overpasses, passenger rail, port development. It makes America more efficient, and it makes us more competitive. And there's never been a more critical moment than now to do it.  As kids, we used to sing this song:  London bridge is falling down, falling down. London bridge is falling down. One, two, three, we all fall down.  Well, we saw what happened in Minnesota when that bridge fell down.  In Cleveland, the Inner Belt Bridge project did not receive the $125 million needed to continue to replace the aging I-90 bridge. The current bridge is being used well beyond its intended lifespan, and is the same design as the bridge that collapsed in Minneapolis in 2007.  In NW Ohio, there is a smaller project in need of funding. McCord Road in Holland, Ohio is the site of Nortfolk Southern's main line and Amtrak. Two high school students from Springfield High School were involved in a tragic accident there in 2009--one lost their life and one was permanently injured, having lost a leg.  The McCord Road project requested just $10 million. However, it did not receive funding with this round of TIGER grants.  There are thousands more projects like this across the Nation, both large and small, but all in great need of investment from the federal government.  I urge my colleagues to support this funding for National Infrastructure Investments. Let's build America's homeland forward and put America to work in the process.
