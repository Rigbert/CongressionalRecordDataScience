President, it is a delight to call the Senate's attention to an outstanding Vermonter who was recently recognized for his work to help Vermonters who have struggled with social and economic injustice.  Since 1997, the Burlington Free Press has invited readers to nominate a Vermont resident to be recognized as Vermonter of the Year. Those nominated are among the best doers and visionaries the Green Mountain State has to offer, and each nominee has made a difference in his or her community. Previous winners have included philanthropists, college presidents, a former Governor and a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. On the eve of the New Year, the Burlington Free Press named Hal Colston the 2014 Vermonter of the Year.  Hal is a resident of Winooski and certainly deserves this honor. Since relocating to Vermont 25 years ago, Hal's dedication to social, economic, and racial justice has served his community well. He has maintained a steadfast voice for those unable to be heard on their own.  Hal is well known for his entrepreneurial spirit, and he has successfully created and led numerous nonprofit initiatives. In announcing Hal's selection, the Free Press aptly calls him a ``serial do-gooder.'' He received national recognition after founding Good News Garage, which enables individuals and families to move away from poverty by providing reliable transportation. Similarly, he recognized that those in poverty are often without the support networks necessary to move beyond such vulnerable circumstances. As a result, he established NeighborKeepers, an organization that focuses on building supportive community networks that direct families toward the resources they need to succeed. Today he leads the Partnership for Change, a diverse group of community stakeholders seeking to remodel the Burlington and Winooski School Districts by establishing a student-centered learning system.  As communities work to overcome the challenges of poverty and individuals pursue more prosperous lives for themselves and their families, it is the passionate dedication to serve by leaders such as Hal Colston that makes the greatest difference.  In recognition of Hal Colston's service, I ask unanimous consent that Aki Soga's article from the December 31, 2014, edition of the Burlington Free Press be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, Dec. 31, 2014]                   Vermonter of the Year: Hal Colston       You might call Hal Colston a serial do-gooder.       The Winooski resident has laid down a track record of work      to improve the lives of people in the community during his      25-year tenure in Vermont.       Colston is best known as the founder of Good News Garage,      the nonprofit that fixes donated vehicles for low-income      people.       He also is known for launching NeighborKeepers, an      initiative to help families in need build relationships with      those who can provide the support they need.       He was instrumental in forcing Vermont to confront the      issue of racial profiling by the police.       Colston says he sees every day as an opportunity to make a      difference.       ``We get them one at a time with no guarantee for      tomorrow,'' he said. ``May all of us spend our days wisely to      improve the common good.''       Colston's understated demeanor often belies his passion. He      works to give voice to those who are unable to be heard on      their own. He has shown the courage to tackle difficult      issues.       Colston's quiet devotion to bringing the people together      and looking out for those who find themselves in unfortunate      circumstances especially stand out in a year that saw the      streets of this country fill with protest--both peaceful and      violent--against injustice.       For his years of service to the community in the name of      social and economic justice, the Burlington Free Press      editorial board names Hal Colston 2014 Vermonter of the Year.       In nominating Colston for Vermonter of the Year, Laban Hill      of Winooski writes, ``Hal has spent his life devoted to our      community and making a difference in both small and large      ways.''       Colston's work with Good News Garage has earned him      national recognition, including an appearance on the Oprah      show. The idea is simple. For many, one of the bigger      barriers to economic independence is the lack of reliable      transportation. Good News Garage tackles that problem in the      most direct way possible by awarding reliable cars to those      in need.       Colston founded the organization in 1996 after meeting a      Lutheran minister he had heard in Philadelphia shortly before      moving to Vermont. That chance encounter led to developing an      idea and seed funding from what he calls a pan-Lutheran      organization. He launched the nonprofit under the wing of the      Lutheran Social Services New England.       Nearly two decades later, Good News Garage has awarded more      than 4,000 vehicles.                             second career       His career in community service also includes a stint as      associate director of Community Action in Burlington, now      Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity, as executive      director of the Vermont Commission on National and Community      Service and as diversity coordinator for the social services      nonprofit HowardCenter.       Colston also spoke out clearly and firmly when African-     Americans in the community charged that local police were      using racial profiling in stops.       In an April 2007 My Turn piece in the Free Press, Colston      wrote, ``I believe that racial profiling in Vermont is an      epidemic,'' going on to recount his own experience with      ``driving while black.''       Colston did more than complain. He worked to open a      dialogue within the community, including the police, that      allowed people to talk openly about issues surrounding race.       ``We're building trust,'' he said. ``I don't believe we      will ever eradicate racism, but how do we heal from the      wounds?''       All this was a major shift for a man who had made a career      as a chef and restauranteur in Philadelphia, and arrived in      Vermont in 1989 to become the director of catering at the New      England Culinary Institute in Essex.       Colston called his career change a midlife crisis, but said      the work put him in touch with his core values, ``truth and      justice.''       Today, Colston is engaged in what is perhaps his biggest      challenge to date. He serves as director of Partnership for      Change, a collaboration between the Burlington and Winooski      school districts. The mission is to re-imagine public      education to better prepare students from diverse social,      economic and cultural backgrounds to succeed in school, in      their careers and as members of their communities.       ``The reason I love Vermont is it's got its challenges. But      it's really on a human scale. You can have a conversation,''      he said.       For his steady faith in the ability of each person to make      a difference, and putting that faith to work in the service      of his community, Hal Colston is the 2014 Vermonter of the      Year.                          a nominating letter       I would like to nominate Hal Colston for Vermonter of the      Year.       Hal is director of Partnership for Change, which is      remodeling Burlington and Winooski school districts by      establishing a student-centered learning system that enables      all learners to develop skills, knowledge, and relationships      necessary to become confident, motivated, and self-sufficient      learners who are successful in college and careers and are      engaged in their communities.       Hal and his team are changing the way education is      delivered in our communities so that it is more rigorous and      more equitable.       Over the years Hal has been an integral and essential part      of our community. He founded Good News Garage, which is one      of the first nonprofit social enterprise car donation      programs in the U.S. He also founded NeighborKeepers, which      was a community nonprofit that helped the generational poor      become financially secure.       Hal has spent his life devoted to our community and making      a difference in both small and large ways. He seems like the      ideal candidate for the Burlington Free Press's Vermonter of      the Year. In addition, there has never been a person of color      who has been recognized as Vermonter of the Year. It's about      time.       There are so many people of color in Vermont who are making      important contributions to our community. Now is the time to      begin recognizing them.
