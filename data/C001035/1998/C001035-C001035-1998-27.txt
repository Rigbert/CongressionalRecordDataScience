President, diabetes is a serious and potentially life-threatening disease affecting more than 16 million Americans at a cost of more than $137 billion annually. That is more than the cost of treating any other disease. Moreover, since 3 million elderly Medicare beneficiaries have been diagnosed with diabetes, and another 3 million are likely to have it but not realize it at this point, nowhere is the economic impact of diabetes felt more strongly than in our Medicare Program.  Treating seniors for the often devastating complications associated with diabetes accounts for more than one-quarter of all Medicare expenses. Therefore, helping diabetic seniors avoid the complications of their disease will not only greatly improve the quality of their lives, but also help reduce the economic burden that diabetes places on the Medicare Program. This, Mr. President, is essential to the long-term economic viability of Medicare.  While there is no known cure, diabetes is largely a treatable disease. Many people who have diabetes can lead completely normal, active lives as long as they stick to a proper diet, carefully monitor the amount of their blood sugar or glucose, and take their medicine, which may or may not include insulin.  However, Mr. President, unfortunately, if a person with diabetes does not follow this rather strict regimen, they put themselves at risk of blindness, loss of limbs and an increased chance of heart disease, kidney failure, and stroke. Therefore, appropriate preventive services for diabetes have the potential to save a great deal of money that otherwise would go for hospitalization or other acute care costs--not to mention a great deal of unnecessary pain and suffering.  Mr. President, Congress recently took a number of important steps to improve Medicare coverage of preventive care for individuals with diabetes. Prior to enactment of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Medicare covered diabetes self-maintenance education services in inpatient or hospital-based settings and in limited outpatient settings, specifically hospital outpatient departments or rural health clinics.  Medicare did not, however, cover education services if they were given in any other outpatient setting, such as a physician's office. Moreover, while Medicare did cover the cost of blood-testing strips used to monitor the sugar in the blood, it did so only for type I diabetics who required insulin to control their disease. Last year's Balanced Budget Act rightly expanded Medicare to cover all outpatient self-management training services as well as providing uniform coverage of blood-testing strips for all people with diabetes.  With the enactment of the Balanced Budget Act, we made significant progress toward improving care for Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes. However, Mr. President, there is more that we can do.  External insulin infusion pumps have proven to be more effective at controlling blood glucose levels than conventional injection therapy for many insulin-dependent diabetics. This helps them to avoid the expensive complications and the suffering resulting from uncontrolled diabetes. However, Mr. President, Medicare currently does not cover these pumps, even in cases where they have been prescribed as medically necessary by the Medicare beneficiary's physician. I am, therefore, today pleased to introduce legislation, the Medicare Insulin Pump Coverage Act of 1998, that would expand Medicare coverage to cover insulin infusion pumps for certain type I diabetics.  External insulin pumps are neither investigational nor experimental. They are widely accepted by health care professionals involved in treating patients with diabetes. Moreover, studies such as the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial sponsored by NIH have established that maintaining blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible is the key to preventing the devastating complications of diabetes.  For many patients, Mr. President, the use of an infusion pump is the only way that optimal blood glucose control can be achieved safely and effectively. That is why virtually all other third-party payers--including most State Medicaid programs and CHAMPUS--cover the device. Moreover, there is precedent under the Medicare Program itself for covering the pump. Medicare currently covers infusion pumps for numerous cancer drugs as well as for pain control medications.  Mr. President, I first became interested in this problem because of the experience of one of my constituents, Nona Frederich of Raymond, ME. She is an example of the kind of Medicare patient who would benefit from the pump. She is currently, unfortunately, being denied what is for her the most effective form of glucose control.  Nona has been an insulin-dependent diabetic since 1962. Because of her extremely volatile insulin sensitivity, her diabetic specialist placed her on an insulin infusion pump in January of 1982. Until she reached age 65, the cost of the pump and operating supplies was underwritten in large part by her insurer, Colorado Blue-Cross-Blue Shield, and later by Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Maine.  In March of 1995, it became necessary for Nona to purchase a new infusion pump. By now, however, she was older and on Medicare. Much to her surprise, Medicare refused to cover the pump, even though her doctor had prescribed it as clearly being medically necessary to help control her diabetes. Since then, with the help of my Portland office staff, the Frederichs have worked their way through the Health Care Financing Administration's system of appeals. Unfortunately, in January of this year, they received final notification of a negative decision by the Department of Health and Human Services. Their only option now is to file a civil suit, which they are simply not in a position to pursue.  The Frederichs literally have notebooks filled with documentation of the procedures they have followed and the evidence they have submitted. Moreover, they have personally paid close to $5,000 in original pump costs and supplies for which they have received no reimbursement under the Medicare Program. For a Medicare beneficiary with limited income, these kinds of costs can be devastating. They can place the pump completely out of reach, even though the pump is medically necessary. In such a case, such patients would be forced to return to or continue with conventional insulin therapy which simply may not be as effective in controlling their blood sugar. As a consequence, these patients are admitted to the hospital with complications over and over again. The irony is that then Medicare will pick up the bill, and a far higher bill it will be than if Medicare had paid for the pump in the first place.  While potentially devastating for an individual, the financial cost to Medicare of expanding coverage to include the insulin-infusion pump would be relatively minor. Under my bill, the pump would have to be prescribed by a physician and the beneficiary would have to be a Type-I diabetic, ``experiencing severe swings of high and low blood glucose levels.'' Of the estimated 3 million Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes, only about 5 percent are Type-I, or insulin-dependent. Of these, it is estimated the pump would be appropriate for only about 4 percent. But what a difference it would make in the lives of those 4 percent.  The American Diabetes Association, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Association of Diabetes Educators, as well as officials at the Centers for Disease Control, have all advocated expanding Medicare to cover insulin pumps for Type-I diabetics who would otherwise have great difficulty in controlling their blood sugar.  I am very pleased to be introducing this legislation today to do just that. I urge my colleagues to join me as cosponsors.  I ask that the text of the bill be entered into the record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2292         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives      of the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Older Americans Act of 1965 to extend the authorizations of appropriations for that Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.              older americans act reauthorization of 1998 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I introduce the Older Americans Act Reauthorization Bill of 1998. I have 22 co-sponsors: Senator Barbara Mikulski, Senator James Inhofe, Senator Gordon Smith, Senator Lauch Faircloth, Senator Daniel Inouye, Senator Rick Santorum, Senator John Breaux, Senator Richard Durbin, Senator Max Cleland, Senator Edward Kennedy, Senator Paul Sarbanes, Senator Barbara Boxer, Senator Patty Murray, Senator Wendell Ford, Senator Ron Wyden, Senator Pat Roberts, Senator Daniel Akaka, Senator Harry Reid, Senator Richard Bryan, Senator Carl Levin, Senator Bob Graham, and Senator Charles Grassley.  The OAA expired in 1995, and we are entering the fourth year without an OAA reauthorization. The bill would reauthorize the OAA thru the year 2001 using the language of the 1992 Act. This time frame would give needed stability to OAA programs while allowing a full evaluation of the OAA to ensure it is relevant to our current and future seniors.  Reauthorization of the OAA is absolutely essential. It is the major vehicle for the delivery of such programs as: meals on wheels; congregate meals; home care (personal care, homemaker, and chore service); adult day care; senior centers; transportation; a job program with skills training for low income seniors; a long term care ombudsman; research and demonstration projects; and abuse prevention and elder rights.  In addition, this is the cornerstone of programs for elderly Native Americans because it is the only federal program that allows tribes to directly plan for the needs of their elderly based on their own culture and traditions.  The OAA is a coordinated system of care that can work alone or hand in hand with Medicare and Medicaid services for those seniors in greatest social and economic need. It also encourages public/private partnerships; promotes seniors volunteering to help one another; and spells out a planning and oversight mechanism that includes the seniors themselves.  We all recognize and appreciate the hard work of the Sub-Committee on Aging to get an updated, reauthorized bill to us during this Congress, and I will continue to work in support of their effort. However, with our condensed legislative calendar, the likelihood of completing the full committeeprocess is diminished. This legislation would provide a short term reauthorization in order to allow The Committee to continue its work to rewrite the 1992 law.  This bill is endorsed by 32 of the major national aging organizations and associations, a list is attached.  Mr. President, our nation's seniors and their families are very concerned that these vital services will stop. It is time to reassure them.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of groups supporting the bill be printed in the Record.
