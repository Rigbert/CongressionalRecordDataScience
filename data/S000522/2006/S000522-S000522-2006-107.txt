Mr. Chairman, let me just say, I appreciate the gentlewoman's willingness to withdraw this amendment.  I, like many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, have worked for years going back to the creation of the International Fund for Ireland in the 1980s on providing funding and direction for the IFI. I have visited its projects and witnessed the cross community cooperation. As a direct result of the IFI and U.S. support for the fund, we have seen tremendous job creation. I would agree, in the Republic of Ireland there has been a significant growth, economic recovery, particularly in the Dublin area, not necessarily in western Ireland, but certainly in the Dublin area.  But in Northern Ireland, in Belfast, and in the counties in the north, there remains serious problems, problems that fuel social unrest. One of the things that I find so encouraging is that, we have worked well with the leaders of the IFI. They are on a glide path to ending foreign support for this program. But they are doing so in a way that encourages police corporation and sustains good programs. They did it frankly directly at our request.                              {time}  0930  The remaining problem is that the Catholics and the Protestants still haven't collaborated enough where prejudices have broken down. There are 5,700 projects that have been funded under the IFI, and I am glad the gentlewoman is withdrawing her amendment.
