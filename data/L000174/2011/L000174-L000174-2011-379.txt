I will yield, of course, to her. She has been indefatigable in her support of Judge Chen in the committee, in the Halls of the Senate, and in her steadfast work with the leadership to get this nominee before us. I can brag about all the work she has done easier than she might, but I hope Judge Chen and his family know they had as strong and as stalwart a supporter on the Senate Judiciary Committee as they could possibly have with Senator Feinstein.  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
