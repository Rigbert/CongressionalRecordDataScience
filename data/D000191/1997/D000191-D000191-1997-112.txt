Speaker, I rise today to join millions of American parents, teachers, doctors, and children's advocates in endorsing a content-based rating system for television viewing among children. For too long Congress and the American people have left programming content decisions to motion picture and broadcasting industry executives. Parents have expressed frustration with the constant barrage of violence, sex, and adult language on television. I am pleased to join Representatives Markey, Burton, Spratt, Moran, and others to introduce a bill that gives parents the ability to determine what type of programming content is appropriate for their children to watch.  Parents are tired of having Hollywood tell them what is best for their children. Congress gave the broadcasting industry a golden opportunity to meet this challenge in the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Instead of addressing these longstanding concerns, the industry proposed an age-based rating system that is still inadequate because it does not inform parents of objectionable programming content. Furthermore, the age-based proposal will continue to prevent parents from making informed choices about their children's viewing behavior. The rapid growth of network and cable programming has been a mixed blessing for parents. They are left with the daunting task of learning the content of numerous shows and channels. The age-based rating system will not help make this task any easier.  I have heard from parents and child advocates all across Oregon who say that they want to know what to expect from a particular television show. They also want to know if the show contains explicit sex, adult language, and excessive violence. Most importantly, they want to make their own decisions about what their own children watch, not leaving the decisions up to television executives. A parent does not want to be told that their child is old enough to watch a ``TV-PG'' rated show. The majority of parents are smart enough to know that this category is quite broad, covering a wide range of shows.  According to a nationwide survey conducted by the National Parent Teachers Association [PTA], over 80 percent of parents stated that they want separate ratings for sex, violence, and language content to help parents decide what shows their children can and cannot watch. In fact, a large number of organizations have criticized the age-based rating system including the National PTA, the American Medical Association [AMA], the American Academyof Pediatrics, the Children's Defense Fund [CDF], Family Research Council, and many others. I am confident that this bill will aid parents with these decisions and encourage the broadcasting industry to adopt a content-specific rating system.  In an attempt to require broadcasters and manufacturers to help parents block shows they considered too objectionable, Congress passed the V-chip law to the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Until this law takes effect in 1998, this bill is the necessary next step in addressing the concerns of parents in the information age.                          ____________________
