Speaker, it is with a great sense of honor that I rise to celebrate Black History Month and its 2005 theme--the Niagara Movement. Fitting with this theme which honors the first African American meeting held to end racial discrimination, I would like to recognize the struggles and achievements of African Americans in the steelworker union movement who faced daunting challenges, but whose lives were forces for change.  Over the last century, African American industrial history has broken through significant barriers. However, the struggle for equal rights and protections faced numerous challenges during this time. The modern struggle for access to equal rights, protections, and work began in 1892 with the Homestead Strike, when African American workers were brought in on trains, unaware of their destination, to break the strike. This marked the advent of the northward migration of African American fieldworkers to the mills of the North.  Though African Americans would increasingly join the steel mills, they faced discrimination and limited opportunities once they arrived. This, despite the increased strength and numbers the African American community provided the labor movement, particularly during World War I when African American representation in the steel mills swelled. However, it is important to note the perseverance of these brave workers who accepted some of the most dangerous jobs and the legacy they provided for the generations after them who continued the fight for equal rights and equal opportunity.  Unfortunately, the successful CIO organizing drives of the 1930s and success of the broader labor movement began to leave African Americans behind. Though African Americans had increasingly joined the mills and unions, by World War II they still faced de facto limits on the types of opportunities they could expect at the mills. Generally limited to the lower skilled positions, regardless of their actual ability, this generation began to challenge the working order and demand equal treatment, both by their own unions and by management.  These struggles culminated in the 1970s, when the mills and unions began setting hiring and promotion goals for women and minorities. Though this represented a watershed event for African American steelworkers, they have continued to forcefully advocate for their rights while working tirelessly for labor rights and the future of the steel industry.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in recognizing the contributions these American heroes have made to the labor movement and to their communities. I am proud to honor the ideals represented by Black History Month and its 2005 theme of the Niagara Movement, by recognizing the African American steelworkers who struggled and continue to fight for equality, opportunity, and an end to racial discrimination.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E201]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]    CELEBRATING BLACK HISTORY MONTH AND ITS 2005 THEME--THE NIAGARA                                 MOVEMENT                                 ______                                                         HON.
