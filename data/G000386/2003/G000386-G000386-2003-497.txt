 President, I appreciate very much what Senator Kerry has stated to us. I want everybody to know that I share their concerns. I think I expressed and shared that in legislation on which I joined with Senator Baucus last fall, not reintroduced this year. But Senator Baucus and I reflected on this and accommodated this as one of many factors in a Medicare bill that we put together. The disproportionate share program, of course, is a primary source of support for safety net hospitals which serve vulnerable patients. I agree that the safety net hospitals are also under considerable financial strain and that the disproportionate share hospital cuts now in effect make it even harder. That has been compounded by a weaker economy. The number of uninsured has gone up.  Nationally, the 2003 disproportionate share hospital cliff represents an estimated reduction of $1.1 billion to total State allotments for fiscal year 2002 to 2003. I supported fixing this in the past, as I have stated.  In June, we will in fact be considering Medicare prescription drug legislation. I think it is very appropriate to deal with that at that particular time. I am committed to working with my colleagues on this important issue in the context of our work on the Medicare prescription drug bill.
