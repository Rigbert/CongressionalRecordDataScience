Speaker, if the gentleman from Ohio would continue to yield, I think what the gentleman from New Jersey said is absolutely accurate, and they expect that through the institutions that are set up, these NAFTA tribunals or CAFTA tribunals or TWO or they meet in places that most people had never heard of. Right? Davos, who can get there? Do people want to go to a meeting somewhere on the west coast of Mexico around Cancun or whatever that was? The roads are blocked off.  They tried to pass something here on GATT. When did they do it? In a lame duck session after midnight. In these countries, by special session, early in the morning, late at night, and the people in those societies even have less opportunity to try to impact the legislative process, as I have spoken about this evening. So we have surrendered, we have surrendered to the largest, most powerful private corporations on the face of the Earth: oil companies, automotive companies, electrical companies, and agricultural companies, people that need cheap labor whether it is to make clothing or whether it is to pick sugar beets, whatever it is. What we have done is we have let that big bulldozer ride over all of us.  And here we stand in the citadel of freedom this evening and we say to ourselves, is this the best we can do? Is this the best we can do, a Nation that rebuilt Europe after the Second World War, a Nation that worked for 50 years to see the collapse of the Soviet regime? Is this the best we can do in the modern age in the 21st century?
