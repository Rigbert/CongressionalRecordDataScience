Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  I would like to engage the author of the primary amendment in a few questions here, if I could.  As I understand it, the Tauzin amendment does not change the portion of the gentleman's substitute, which would require when a specified regulatory law diminishes the fair market value of that portion or any portion of a property by 10 percent or more; is that correct?
