 President, I want to commend the President for renewing import sanctions against the repressive military junta in Burma. The quick action of both Congress and the President on this matter underscores America's commitment to freedom and justice in that country.  Unfortunately, there have been no significant developments inside Burma since I last spoke on this issue several weeks ago. In 2006, Burma is expected to assume chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN; there could be no greater loss of face to ASEAN or the region.  I am pleased that some of our allies in the European Union, E.U. have taken a principled stand over Burma's participation in the upcoming Asia-Europe Meeting, ADEM. However, the United Nations must do more to restore democracy to the Burmese people.  We need a full court press on the junta, which must entail the downgrading of diplomatic relations with the illegitimate State Peace and Development Council, SPDC, by placing its senior representative in Washington on the next flight to Southeast Asia. We do not have a U.S. Ambassador in Rangoon; the junta should not have one here.  I ran into the SPDC's ``ambassador'' in Washington at a July 4th celebration at the State Department, and told Mr. Linn Myaing to free Burmese democracy leader DAW Aung San Suu Kyi.  I find it incredible that someone from such an odious regime would be invited to celebrate the independence of the freest country in the world. Someone is clearly asleep at the wheel over in Foggy Bottom.                          ____________________
