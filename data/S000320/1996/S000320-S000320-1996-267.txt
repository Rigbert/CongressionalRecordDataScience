 President, this is the same amendment which was adopted by the Senate on a vote of 93 to 5 on the welfare reform bill last year. It provides a $5,000 tax break for adoption expenses, and it will allow thousands of children to find a home in America.  The amendment is offset with savings in the underlying bill. There is no guarantee that the adoption legislation reported by the Finance Committee will be considered at all this year. This may be our last chance to pass this legislation which has overwhelming bipartisan support.  Again, Mr. President, 93 Senators in this Chamber voted for this exact amendment last fall under almost identical circumstances. If we do not adopt this adoption tax credit now, we might lose our chance this year. I ask we waive the Budget Act and adopt this amendment.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator D'Amato be added as a cosponsor.
