I want to say this much. If there has been any criticism of Attorney General Janet Reno in the last 6 months, it is that she is too independent. There was a question as to whether this President would even reappoint her because of her independence, the fact she had named four independent counsel. That has been the criticism of Attorney General Reno. She calls them as she sees them. She is a professional.  She has made a decision today which the Republicans are unhappy with; they wanted an independent counsel named in this case. But when she named four previous independent counsel, they cheered--good judgment, good work. Now, when she has decided not to call for one, they want to bring her up to Capitol Hill, put her before the committee, start asking questions: Why won't you bend to this pressure? I hope she does not. I hope she calls it based on the evidence.  On a show that I was on last night, one of my colleagues on the Republican side said, ``Hasn't there been enough time here? Shouldn't she call for an independent counsel?''  This is not about time. This is about evidence, credible witnesses. If they do not come forward with the evidence and with the testimony to justify an independent counsel, I hope Attorney General Reno will not bow to pressure here. I hope she will stand up for what she believes in. And as a Democrat, I am prepared to accept her decision. I believe she is professional enough that we can stand behind her. But we jeopardize the future of this statute, and I think we ought to think twice about it, by putting this kind of public pressure on the Attorney General trying to push her in one political direction or the other.
