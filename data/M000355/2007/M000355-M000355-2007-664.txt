 President, let me say to my friend the majority leader, I still hope we can finish this bill. We are not that far away from completion, if we can work out an orderly way in which to deal with the amendments that need to be offered by this side. I hope we can reach agreement tomorrow and move toward completing the bill.                          ____________________
