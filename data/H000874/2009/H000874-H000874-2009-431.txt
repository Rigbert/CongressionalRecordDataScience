As you know, that's Mr. Frank's practice. We believe, I believe, it's a good practice.  Whether or not he will have a markup will depend upon the timeframe. The problem is, as the gentleman probably knows, the American public and the Congress on both sides of the aisle are very concerned that if we have to consider within a constricted timeframe the request, either of the Bush administration during the latter days of its term, or the beginning of the Obama administration, we get to have a second request for the second phase of the TARP funding. We want to have in place conditions for the expenditure of that money similar to what we have imposed or the administration imposed, but we also legislatively imposed, it didn't pass, on the automobile companies for the receipt of money.  So the answer to your question is we may not have the time to do the markup, because we are not sure when that second request is coming down. I don't expect it to come down before we consider this legislation, but it may come down shortly thereafter.
