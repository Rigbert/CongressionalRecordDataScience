Speaker, last month the Gingrich Republicans shut down the Federal Government for the longest period of time in the history of the United States. While 800,000 Federal workers were sent home with uncertainty as to whether they would be paid, the American taxpayers picked up the bill. In fact, we paid $700 million when the Gingrich Republicans, because of their failure to pass spending bills, shut down the Federal Government. Now they are about to set another record. They are going to shut down the Federal Government for the second time in 1 year. This time they want to do it a few days before Christmas.  Just a few minutes ago, the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Gingrich] and his Republican friends passed a motion here so we could recess and leave for 3 days. Members of Congress can go home and shop for Christmas gifts while 350,000 Federal employees are uncertain as to whether or not they are going to be on the payroll on Monday. If Members of Congress on the Republican side believe this is a matter of principle, join me and support the bill: No budget, no pay. Shut down the Government, you shut down congressional paychecks. That will end this foolishness in a hurry.                          ____________________
