Speaker, I am proud to rise today and introduce the Environmental Justice Act of 2016.  Twenty-four years ago, I first introduced the Environmental Justice Act of 1992, with my good friend and former colleague Senator Al Gore. After introducing our bill, we worked tirelessly to advance many of the policies proposed in our legislation. On February 11, 1994, President Clinton signed Executive Order 12898, ``Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations''. This historic Executive Order established the federal infrastructure to identify and address environmental risks--especially in minority and low-income communities that were often overlooked and underserved.  At that time, Senator Gore and I believed that every person has the right to safe water and clean air. We believed children and parents in every community deserve access to green public spaces. Since then many of the ideas that we proposed in our 1992 bill have been adopted by the EPA. For example, resources like EJSCREEN, help anyone in the country find a report on the quality of their neighborhood's water and air.  Mr. Speaker, there is still much work to be done. The threats and needs are changing, but the urgency of and my commitment to this important and evolving challenge remain the same. In Georgia's 5th Congressional District and across the country, many people find that even when a serious environmental problem is discovered, it is difficult for them to take action. This bill responds to this grave reality and makes progress in the fight for every person to have equal access to a healthy environment.  The Environmental Justice Act of 2016 will create a tax incentive for 501(c)(3) organizations, like colleges and universities, to devote staff and resources to the hard work of environmental justice. This bill is intended to encourage scientists, activists, and organizers to invest their talents into ensuring that existing environmental protections are improved and enforced in every community. People must know their rights and the tools that are available to them. This bill will not only advance the conversation but also invest in the effort.  Mr. Speaker, I know that we can come together to address this important national issue. We cannot ignore the public health and safety of our communities. We cannot cut corners at the expense of our friends and neighbors. We must fully respect the life and dignity of each and every person, and uphold their right to live, learn, and work in a clean and safe environment.  We must cherish this Earth; for it is the only home we will likely ever know. I hope that all of my colleagues will join me in supporting this common-sense legislation.                          ____________________
