 As I understand it, there have been no hearings by the Budget Committee, no hearings by the Appropriations Committee, no hearings by the Ways and Means Committee, or by any other committee involved in fiscal matters as to what the ramifications of that cap will be to individual programs or individual Americans.  I share the gentleman's view and have voted consistently, as I voted for the balanced budget amendment, as the gentleman knows, last we considered it, to bring our fiscal house into order. I think neither party can necessarily take sole responsibility for doing so or not doing so when it comes to fiscal balance.  But I do tell my friend that, with respect to transparency and openness and to the inclusion of all the Members of the body, it is, I think, not consistent with that objective to give to one person, however brilliant that person is--and I happen to have great respect, as the gentleman knows and as I have said so publicly in the press, for Mr. Ryan, who I think is a very positive, effective, important Member of this body; but I am not for giving any one person in this body the authority to unilaterally set the number at which we will fund America's government for the next 7 months.  I yield to my friend to see if he might have a response to that because, in his responses to me--and I understand the cap--but at any number below that, at 2007, 2006, 2005 levels, it seems to me this resolution authorizes Mr. Ryan to set such figures as he unilaterally determines is an appropriate figure. In his mind, that may be an appropriate figure; but it is not necessarily the same figure that this body voting in a transparent, open way might select.
