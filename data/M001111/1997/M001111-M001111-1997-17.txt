 President, I rise today to submit a resolution proclaiming November 6, 1997, as National Concern about Young People and Gun Violence Day. Last year, Senators Wellstone, Specter, and Bradley introduced this resolution. I am joined by Senator Kempthorne and many other colleagues today in supporting an identical resolution. We have all seen the good that can come from focusing attention on young people and helping organizations across the country mobilize children to stay away from gun violence.  The Day of Concern was initiated by Mary Lewis Grow, a Minnesota homemaker, in 1996. Other groups, such as Mothers Against Violence in America, have joined her effort to establish a Day of Concern. The proclamation of a special day of recognition also provided support to a national effort to encourage students to sign a pledge against gun violence. In 1996, 32,000 students in Washington State signed the pledge card, as did more than 200,000 children in New York City, and tens of thousands more across the nation.  The Student Pledge Against Gun Violence calls for a national observance onNovember 6 to give students throughout America the chance to make a promise, in writing, that they will do their part to prevent gun violence. The students' pledge promises three things: first, they will never carry a gun to school; second, they will never resolve a dispute with a gun; and third, they will use their influence with friends to discourage them from resolving disputes with guns.  Mr. President, just last week I joined several colleagues on the floor of the Senate as we decried the murder of Ann Harris, a 17-year-old Virginian, by a 19-year-old man in Washington State. This random act of violence was apparently precipitated because the car in which Ann was a passenger was going too slowly for the driver of the car in which the murderer was riding. The young man was angry enough and morally numbed enough to fire his gun into Ann's car, killing Ann. What a tragedy. What a waste.  In another example, a 14-year-old boy opened fire in a Moses Lake, WA classroom, killing a teacher and student and wounding others. He has been convicted, but that does little to ease the pain of the loss suffered by that small community. Maybe if he had signed a pledge, maybe if he had heard the message over and over from parents and friends that gun violence was the wrong way to solve problems, maybe if * * * maybe if * * *. We don't know how we might have stopped this act of violence, but we know we all have to try education, try outreach, try everything.  We all have been heartened by statistics showing crime in America on the decline. A number of factors are involved, including community-based policing, stiffer sentences for those convicted, youth crime prevention programs, and population demographics. I don't think any of us intend to rest on our successes. Rather, we must review programs that work, and focus our limited resources on those. Legislation passed earlier this year, the Safe and Drug Free Communities Act, will help us do that.  Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to join in this simple effort to focus attention on gun violence among youth by proclaiming November 6, a ``Day of Concern about Young People and Gun Violence.'' This is an easy step for us to help facilitate the work that must go on in each community across America, as parents, teachers, friends, and students try to prevent gun violence before it continues to ruin countless lives.                          ____________________
