Speaker, last month, the jobs and fair trade caucus presented its monthly Golden Eagle Award to the employee owners of United Airlines, our Nation's leading airline, and our Corporate Vulture Award to Hershey foods, a company that continues to outsource its Hershey Kiss production to Mexico and downsize its American work force. The two companies, United Airlines and Hershey foods, exemplify the best and worst of corporate practices in America today.  As you will recall, the Golden Eagle Award rewards fine U.S. companies that represent the best that is in us as a nation, companies which treat their workers with dignity while making decent profits, strengthen their communities, charge a reasonable price for products, and remain and prosper in the United States. When all of these practices are undertaken by one company, that company deserves our praise and to be recognized as a Golden Eagle Co.  The Corporate Vulture Award, like the scavenger it represents, is given to a company in need of vast improvement, a company which exploits our marketplace yet downsizes its work force in America. These firms outsource most production to foreign countries, and use sweatshop labor abroad but then import these transhipped products back to the United States while keeping prices high here at home and maintaining all of the benefits of being called an American company. Corporate vultures deserve our disdain.  Today, the jobs and fair trade caucus is proud to present this month's GoldenEagle Award to Natural Cotton Colors, a small manufacturer of naturally colored cottons located in Wickenburg, AZ. Sally Fox, the founder of Natural Cotton Colors and inventor of environmentally safe colored cotton suitable for organic farming, is quite an American.  As Sally herself has stated, the success of her company is a real Jack and the Beanstalk Story. In 1982, Sally came across brown cotton seeds in a bag and thought that she could grow and sell the brown cotton to hobbyists who hand spin yarn. A small American business was thus born. Since those humble beginnings, Natural Cotton Colors now sells environmentally safe colored cotton around the world. The company's sales over the past few years have averaged around $5 million.  What makes Natural Cotton Colors unique is its commitment to the environment. Sally developed her own trademark, Fox Fibre, for the purpose of promoting environmentally sustainable production of cotton--while remaining profitable. In order for a textile manufacturer to be licensed to use the Fox Fibre trademark, the manufacturer must agree to abide by numerous environmental standards. Manufacturers using Fox Fibre are not allowed to use dye, bleach, or formaldehyde finish in their production. With so many multinational corporations and countries engaged in a race to lower environmental standards around the world, Natural Cotton Colors is to be strongly commended for one small company's efforts to promote a safer and cleaner environment for our children.  The story of Sally Fox and Natural Cotton Colors is truly an American story. By resisting the temptation to outsource production, Sally Fox and her company provide good jobs for American workers and farmers. When Sally receives an order for her product, Natural Cotton Colors consistently contracts out to American farmers scattered around the Midwest. Although she is able to cut costs dramatically by contracting out the company's work to cheap labor in Mexico and China, Sally Fox has remained strong in her commitment to America.  Natural Cotton Colors is only one of thousands of small businesses in America that do so much to strengthen our communities and our lives. American small businesses provided virtually all of the net new jobs created over the past 10 years. Small businesses account for 50 percent of total sales in the United States.  Many small businesses never are recognized for their achievements and their commitment to America. Today, we present the Golden Eagle Award, which includes this certificate and an American flag flown over the U.S. Capitol, to Natural Cotton Colors and Sally Fox for their commitment to the environment, and their commitment to America. Natural Cotton Colors is a small company with a big vision which we as a nation can benefit from.  In marked contrast to Natural Cotton color's efforts and commitment to remain in the United States, this month's Corporate Vulture Award is presented to the Green Giant division of Pillsbury and its parent company, Grand Metropolitan PLC. Green Giant/Pillsbury is one of many U.S. corporations that have packed their bags and set up shop in the sweatshops and killing fields of the developing world, leaving a wake of wrecked families and communities here at home in America.  In Green Giant's case, the company has shipped their contracts for fresh produce and their frozen food facilities south of the border to Mexico. A close look at virtually any supermarket's frozen food shelves will reveal packages with tiny, obscured, and ambiguous Green Giant labels indicating the food was grown or processed in Mexico or other foreign countries. Green Giant even has the audacity of naming one of their brands ``American Mixtures''--a product that contains mostly vegetables grown in and imported from Mexico but packaged in America. More than 60 percent of Green Giant's broccoli and cauliflower is actually grown in Mexico.  As much as Green Giant/Pillsbury and Grand Metropolitan have tried to hide the facts, the truth is that these companies have actively downsized their American work force and sent their production abroad.  Watsonville, CA, was once referred to as the frozen food capital of the world. In the mid-1980's, the frozen food packaging industry, including Green Giant, employed 3,500 workers at its peak. Today, there are less than 1,500 workers in Watsonville employed in frozen food packaging.  Where did the jobs go? In 1993, Green Giant stated during the NAFTA debate that, and I quote, ``Not a single job in Watsonville is going to Mexico.'' Alas, production in Green Giant's Watsonville plant, where American workers once earned from $7.15 to $11.50 an hour with benefits, has since been moved to Irapuato, Mexico, where workers earn 50 cents an hour without benefits. Not surprisingly, Irapuato, Mexico is the city that many now consider to be the new capital of the frozen food industry.  What do American workers and consumers receive in return? Certainly not lower prices. At my local grocery store in Toledo, OH, a 16 ounce bag of Green Giant cut leaf spinach costs $1.66 and Green Giant cream spinach costs $1.69. The price is the same whether the spinach was grown and processed in the United States or Mexico. There is no price differential for imported goods.  What is different though is the profit that Green Giant and Grand Metropolitan are making off moving their production to Mexico. Grand Metropolitan, which again owns Green Giant, enjoyed record sales in 50 countries last year totaling $12.6 billion. In 1993, the year that Green Giant was not going to move any American jobs to Mexico, the CEO of Grand Metropolitan, Sir Allen Sheppard, earned over $1.25 million in salary alone.  Lost U.S. jobs, downward pressure on U.S. wages, high prices, and huge profits are the characteristics of a corporate vulture. And today we recognize that there are no better examples of being a corporate vulture than Green Giant and Grand Metropolitan. What a shame.                          ____________________
