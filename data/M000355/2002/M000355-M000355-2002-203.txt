 That is certainly a step in the right direction. I echo his observations that even though, after the cloture vote, I understand we may be going to energy, we are close to passing an election reform bill of which I think Members on both sides of the aisle can feel proud. I have assured my friend from Connecticut that we are going to work to pare down the remaining amendments on our side. I know he is going to be doing the same thing.  We believe there are only a few issues that are serious, and, hopefully, we will be able to say to the majority leader soon that we have the ability to put together a agreement that we can bring this up and, hopefully, dispose of it in half a day.
