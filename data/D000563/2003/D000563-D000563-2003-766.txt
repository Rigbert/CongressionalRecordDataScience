Those who were looking for a debate on the war in Iraq had best turn to C-SPAN and witness the question period in London before the British House of Commons. I have been watching it. It is a fascinating debate.  Tony Blair is defending his position in support of the United States. His own party is divided. The conservatives support him. The questioning is very tough. In the course of defending his position, some important questions are being asked and answered in the British House of Commons.  If you would expect the same thing here in the U.S. Congress, you might be surprised or disappointed to learn it is not taking place. What is taking place is speeches on the floor by individual Senators. Today, I have seen Senator Byrd of West Virginia, Senator Dayton of Minnesota, Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts. Others have come to the floor to speak about the war in Iraq. But there has literally been no active debate on this issue on Capitol Hill, in the United States of America, since last October.  The reason, of course, is that last October we enacted a use of force resolution which virtually gave to the President of the United States the authorityto declare war and execute it against Iraq at the time and place of his choosing. I was one of 23 Senators who voted against that resolution, believing that there were better ways to achieve our goals, and that if Congress did that, we would be giving to this President the greatest delegation of authority to wage war ever given to a President.  The time that has intervened since the passage of that resolution has proven me right. Congress has had no voice. Oh, we have had moments of criticism, moments of comment, but we are not a serious part of this national concern and national conversation over what will happen in Iraq. That is indeed unfortunate.  There are several facts I think everyone concedes, virtually everyone, on either side of the issue. The first and most obvious is that Saddam Hussein is a ruthless dictator. His continued domination over the nation of Iraq will continue to pose a threat to the region and a concern for peace-loving nations around the world. The sooner his regime changes, the better. The sooner we control his weapons of mass destruction, the better for the region and for the whole world. No one argues that point, not even the nations in the U.N. Security Council that are arguing with the United States about the best approach.  The second thing I think should be said at the outset is no one questions the fact that the U.S. military, the men and women who make it the best military in the world, deserve our support and our praise. They deserve our continued devotion to their success, whatever our debate about the policy in the Middle East or even in Iraq. As far as those 250,000 American servicemen now stationed around Iraq, and many others on the way, whatever our position on the President's policy, that is irrelevant. We are totally committed to their safety and their safe return. That is exactly the way it should be.  Having said that, though, I think it is still important for us to step back and ask how we have possibly reached this state that we are in today. The United States finds itself in a period of anti-Americanism around the world that is almost unprecedented. I traveled abroad a few weeks ago. I was stunned to find in countries that have traditionally been our friends and allies that, although they are saying little, in private they are very critical of the United States and what we have done.  What happened between September 11, 2001, and March 13, 2003? Remember that date, after the September 11 tragedy, when nations all around the world, including some of our historic enemies, came forward and said they would stand with the United States in fighting the war on terrorism? It was an amazing moment in history. It is a moment we will never forget as Americans.  For the first time since the British came into this building in the War of 1812, the United States was invaded by an enemy. Of course, Pearl Harbor was an attack on the territories as well, but that attack on the continental United States on September 11, 2001, was one that stunned us, saddened us, shocked us as a nation, and we looked for friends and we found them in every corner of the world. They joined us in a war on terrorism, sharing intelligence resources, working together, making real progress. It was a good feeling, a feeling that many of these countries now understood how important a friendship with the United States would be for their future and for the world.  Look where we are today. We are at a point now where we are trying to win enough friends to show that we have a multilateral coalition that is going to wage this war against Iraq.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article that was published in Business Week. The edition was March 10, 2003.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  [From Business Week, Mar. 10, 2003]                            Dollar Diplomacy       Money, it is often said, is the mother's milk of politics.      It's also turning out to be the nectar of superpower      diplomacy.       As George W. Bush approaches the diplomatic climax of his      arduous drive to win backing for war with Iraq, U.S.      diplomats increasingly find themselves tempted to brandish      Uncle Sam's checkbook--and with it, the suggestion that      sticking with America now might mean rewards later. Much of      this bid to win friends is playing out in the U.N. Security      Council, which is grappling with a U.S.-backed resolution      that could trigger military action against Saddam Hussein.      But in broader terms, pressure on the White House to dangle      inducements transcends the U.N. debate and goes to the heart      of Washington's current dilemma--America's poverty of      friendship.       For two years, Administration diplomacy has been marked by      a brash Texas swagger that Bush partisans consider a      refreshing exercise in plain-speaking--and which some      traditional allies consider arrogance. But the differences go      beyond style. In walking away from global treaties and      disdaining the views of traditional allies, Bush foreign      policy has also been marked by an in-your-face unilateralism      that has set much of the world on edge.       Now, with the Administration struggling to round up allies      and hosting the leaders of such nations as Latvia and      Bulgaria to demonstrate the depth of its coalition, the price      of that disdain is coming into focus. ``We've made it harder      than it had to be by taking a high-handed approach,'' says      Samuel R. Berger, National Security Adviser during the      Clinton Administration.       Indeed, the bill for the Administration's approach is just      starting to come due--and the bottom line is breathtaking. On      Feb. 25, Bush aides revealed that the cost of a military      campaign could top $95 billion. That's a far cry from what      happened during the first Gulf War, when coalition      partners paid some $70 billion of the $75 billion war tab.      ``Rebuilding Iraq will require a sustained commitment from      many nations including our own.'' Bush said in speech to      the American Enterprise Institute on Feb. 26. But the fact      is, the U.S. will likely find itself shouldering      peacekeeping duties and much of Iraq reconstruction on its      own--meaning beleaguered American taxpayers may bear the      brunt of the costs.       True, a broad coalition never in the cards. Unlike      Operation Desert Storm, which was a response to Iraq's      invasion of Kuwait, this showdown looms as a exercise in      preemptive action. Still, while Bush talks of a ``coalition      of the willing'' backing a U.S. invasion of Iraq, in reality      the America finds itself with precious few allies as the hour      of decision approaches. And buying allegiances one country at      a time is a far cry from building a cohesive group committed      to a common cause.       Another consequence of the Bush Administration's Iraq      policy is that it could unintentionally undermine the      President's broader goal of implanting the seeds of reform in      the region. If the intervention comes to be seen by Iraq's      neighbors as illegitimate, the result could be more      radicalism, not less. The Administration's lofty goals in the      Mideast could be much harder to achieve if ``Americans are      seen less as a partner than as a foreign power,'' says Jon B.      Alterman, who recently left the Bush State Department.       In a sense, the current bargaining round was heralded by      the September 11 terror strike on America. In the subsequent      war on the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, the White House      decided it had to shore up friendship and showered largesse      on new allies ranging from Tajikistan to impoverished African      nations. None fared better than Pakistan, a desperately poor      country that was pivotal in the anti-terror war. President      Pervez Musharraf's regime suddenly found itself freed of      sanctions imposed for its nuclear testing and the beneficiary      of a $12.5 billion debt restructuring from the U.S. and other      nations. That helped lift Pakistan from a debtor nation to      one that now runs a modest current-account surplus.       Now, the Bush team faces a far more formidable chore in      mustering global support for disarming Iraq by force. With      skepticism rampant, France and a big bloc of nations fear the      consequences of the U.S. making preemptive attacks an      acceptable policy tool. Just as important, they fear that the      risks of a destabilized Mideast far outweigh the danger      Saddam poses. And in the region, where Saddam has been      weakened and contained since the 1991 war, resistance to a      U.S. invasion has led some countries to limit the American      military's rights to nearby bases.       With allies scarce, small wonder that the Bushies may be      tempted to float aid promises--or be hit with a raft of      ``impact payment'' requests from countries such as Egypt,      Israel, Turkey, and Jordan, who claim their economies will be      damaged by the fallout of any conflict. ``When somebody knows      they're necessary for your game plan, they raise the price,''      says former top State Dept. official Chester A. Crocker.       The Bush Administration stoutly denies it's buying U.N.      support or military access. ``The President is not offering      quid pro quos,'' insists White House Press Secretary Ari      Fleischer. In fairness, the practice of cementing an entente      with aid is hardly limited to the Bushies. The Clintonites,      who currently assail Bush's need to reach for his wallet,      threw billions at North Korea to keep its nuclear program      shuttered. They also were forced to shrug when U.S.      contributions to the International Monetary Fund were      squandered by Russian kleptocrats. ``Checkbook diplomacy,''      says former State Dept. official Helmut Sonnenfeldt, ``is as      old as checkbooks.''       The most naked example of haggling came in the U.S.-Turkey      base talks. With Turkish public opinion strongly antiwar and      an economy on the ropes, the Turks sought upwards of $35      billion in U.S. assistance for the right     to station American troops on Turkish soil for use in a      pincer move against Saddam. After bitter negotiations, Ankara      came away with a package that includes up to $20 billion in      cash and loans, some NATO military gear, and assurances that      Iraq's Kurdish nationalists will be kept in check. Says      Mehmet Simsek, A London-based analyst with Merrill Lynch &      Co.: ``The bottom line is, it will give Turkey some breathing      room.''       One reason the talks were so tough is Turkey's history with      Desert Storm. After that war, the U.S. backed out of promises      to compensate the country for the loss of trade with Iraq and      aid to refugees. Now the Turks want money up front.       Jordan may actually be the hardest hit of Iraq's neighbors      this time, so Washington is also receptive to Amman's calls      for help. ``Nearly a quarter of our GDP could be knocked out      as a result [of a new war],'' frets Fahed Fanek, a Jordanian      economist. The Administration is expected to ask Congress for      $150 million in aid on top of the $300 million a year Jordan      now receives. The U.S. already has started to deliver on a      deal for F-16 fighters and Patriot II missiles, likely at a      discount.       Other neighbors have their hands out, too. Israel wants $4      billion in additional military aid and $8 billion in loan      guarantees. Egypt, which sees war losses of $1.6 billion to      its tourist-dependent economy, wants faster delivery of as      much as $415 million earmarked for Cairo.       Much of the dickering has been more subtle. Key swing votes      on the Security Council--Chile, Guinea, Cameroon, Angola,      Mexico, and Pakistan--have growing trade ties with the U.S.      that could be jeopardized by a vote against the U.S.      resolution. Both France and the U.S. are vying for those      votes, the U.S. by noting that the America drive to ease      agriculture subsidies among rich nations could open markets      to Third World farmers.       What will be most telling is how Pakistan votes. After all,      U.S.-backed debt restructuring allowed the country to adopt      reforms that have helped revive the economy. And President      Musharraf left Washington in late 2001 with a 15% increase in      clothing and textile exports to the U.S., worth $500 million      to Pakistani manufacturers. But Pakistani officials insist      money won't sway their vote. ``This is a matter of much      greater importance than just a question of incentives,'' says      Munir Akram, Pakistan's U.N. ambassador.       It's still far from clear whether dollar diplomacy will      give Uncle Sam a clearcut victory in the U.N. But even      without an affirmative vote, Bush seems intent on going ahead      with plans to attack Saddam by late March. Then the questions      become: What kind of alliance will Bush be heading, and how      durable will such a coalition of convenience be?       If all goes swimmingly on the battle-field, some of today's      qualms will surely fade--replaced by radiant TV images of      liberated Iraqis and new-wave technocrats who vow to build a      new nation. But if the intervention turns into the oft-     predicted miasma of Middle Eastern intrigue and dashed hopes,      America could find itself standing far more alone than it is      today. Fast friends may be hard to come by in the self-     centered world of diplomacy. Still, the kind you make because      of truly shared interests seem preferable to the kind you      rent.
