Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, may I suggest that the gentleman from Massachusetts brings up a very good point. Our seas are in serious trouble, primarily because of indiscriminate overfishing. This is just a small step forward, but we are going to address this hopefully on another level very soon in the Magnuson Act with an attempt to again arrest some of the misuse of our seas as far as fishing efforts.  I am one who believes very strongly that there are enough fish if we take care of them, if we scientifically put them on a biological survival rate that we can continue to fish. But if we do not do something with the activities from all of the countries jointly we will be destroying that capability to provide the fish to all of the people of this world.  So I again welcome my good friend, the gentleman from Massachusetts, Gary Studds, to the Committee on Natural Resources, because there is no one who has worked harder over the years to provide and protect the fishing industry for the continued yield of the species which we depend on than the gentleman from Massachusetts. So we will be looking forward to looking with him hopefully sometime in May, bringing to this floor a bill that will address the domestic side of this issue as well as the international side of this issue. For those who may not be aware of this, to me the sea has to be recognized as a provider, and it is our responsibility not only to protect but to conserve and to continue providing of the fisheries, as I have said before, that we depend so heavily upon.  So again I welcome the gentleman from Massachusetts to the committee.                              {time}  1445  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
