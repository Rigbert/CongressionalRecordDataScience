 President, tomorrow the Democratic leader and I will have the honor of celebrating Senator Bennett's life at a memorial service, but I also wish to say a few words about this dear friend and colleague now.  Bob Bennett said there are two kinds of Senators in Washington--workhorses and show horses. It is clear to anyone who knew him which path Senator Bennett followed. This former chaplain, entrepreneur, and CEO came to the Senate with a long resume and a formidable work effort. Over his 18 years of service, Bob typified the constructive player with the steady hand, the kind of Senator who preferred the low-key work of legislating to the bright lights of the media.  Bob worked hard to develop relationships in both parties, and he approached everything he did with creativity, with substance, and with honor.  Senator Bennett served as a member of our conference leadership team, sat on important committees, and pressed forward on a range of different issues.  He also shared my interest in the First Amendment. Bob would be the first to tell you that he viewed his most important job as being a husband. I think his wife Joyce felt the same way. In more than 50 years of marriage, the Bennetts worked together to raise six children. They were blessed with 20 grandchildren as well.  Many of us remember the active role Joyce played in the life of the Senate family over the years, and so we arethinking of her today. We are thinking of the entire Bennett family too.  The Senate honors the memory of Senator Bob Bennett. We will miss him greatly.                          ____________________
