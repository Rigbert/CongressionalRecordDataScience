President, I came to the Capitol yesterday on the fifth anniversary of September 11. I looked out the window, down the Mall on the west side, and I couldn't help but remember what we saw on 9/11. On that morning as we met in a small room on the west side of the Capitol and watched the television broadcast and first heard of a plane crashing into the World Trade Center, I thought: What a freak accident. I hope a lot of people won't die.
