I hope the Senator will work with us--and the Senator from California, too--to give theirspeeches, have the amendments discussed, but before the votes start, we can work out a sequence of votes in a relatively short period of time. It is my understanding that comports with the thinking of the Senator from Kansas. He can speak as long as he wants because he has the floor. Does that comport with his thinking?
