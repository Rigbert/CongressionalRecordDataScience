 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m. on Friday, October 28. I further ask that following the prayer and the pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved, and the Senate proceed to a period for morning business with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes.
