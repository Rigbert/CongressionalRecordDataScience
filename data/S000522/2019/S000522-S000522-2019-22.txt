Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul), the ranking member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I rise today in support of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. Two months ago I had the opportunity to join a press conference with Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Chairman Engel, my colleague, Chris Smith, and Hong Kong prodemocracy activists Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, and Denise Ho to denounce China's authoritarian brutality.  I said it then and I will say it again; today we stand here not as Republicans or Democrats, but as Americans united in our strong support for Hong Kong.  And I would like to take this opportunity to speak directly to the people of Hong Kong, who I know are watching this right now. America stands with you, and America will always support you. We hear you sing our national anthem. We see you carrying our American flag. This is a battle between democracy versus dictatorship, liberty versus tyranny, and freedom versus oppression.  This bill sends a clear message to China that there will be consequences to the ruthless and brutal actions. Congress, the United States, and the world will not stand by idly as the Chinese Communist Party fights for itself and not its own people.  Again, I want to thank the authors of this bill. I am proud to be a part of this movement, this cause. And we have seen quite a bit of response on social media on this bill coming directly from the people of Hong Kong to the Members who are on this floor saying thank you for standing up for us.  That is democracy in action. That is what this country stands for. And it is a proud moment, I think, for both sides of the aisle as we are going through this time in our history to be able to stand together for democracy and such a great movement and cause for freedom.
