 We are going to pass the committee resolution tomorrow. We all know that one of the things the Senate is best at is not doing much. I hope we can work this out so we can get started. Everyone knows the first measure that is going to be up is going to come out of the energy committee. I would say to my friends on the minority side, it is open for amendment. Why don't we get started? Hopefully Senator Murkowski and Senator Cantwell can work through this and we can get going and do the people's business. We are anxious to get started.                          ____________________
