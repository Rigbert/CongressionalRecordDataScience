Chairman, I rise today in opposition to the Republican tax-cut bill, H.R. 1215, because it would undermine deficit reduction efforts. I have always supported a balanced budget, and the responsibility to achieve this is not one that I take lightly. Over the years, I have frequently taken the political [[Page H4223]] road less traveled in the name of deficit reduction. Last month, I was one of only six Democrats to support the rescissions bill because I believe we need to start making tough spending decisions now. In January, I supported a constitutional amendment to balance the budget for the first time because I finally lost faith that the President and Congress have the resolve to balance the budget without being required to do so.
