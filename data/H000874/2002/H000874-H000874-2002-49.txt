Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of this resolution, which was developed by the Committee on House Administration and the Bipartisan Working Group on Continuity of Government led by the gentleman from California (Mr. Cox) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost). It urges the States to examine their laws regarding the conduct of special elections to the House.  The purpose of the resolution as has been said, is to ensure that in the event of a catastrophe, the States will conduct special elections as expeditiously as possible. The two cochairmen of the bipartisan working group, the gentleman from California and the gentleman from Texas, introduced the measure currently before us. H. Res. 559 was referred to the committee which has jurisdiction over congressional elections, the Committee on House Administration.  Mr. Speaker, article 1, section 2 of the Constitution provides: ``The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second year by people of the several States.''  That is, of course, the only way to become a Member of this body. That requirement of popular election may be unusual in a leglislative body, because most legislatures can have appointed Members, at least for a time.  A variety of distinguished former Members of the House and scholarly observers of the Congress have proposed other ideas, ranging from filling vacancies through gubernatorial appointment to choosing replacementMembers from lists submitted in advance by sitting Members. Without discussing the merits of either of these ideas, it suffices to say that they are clearly unconstitutional.                              {time}  1215  It would require a constitutional amendment to fill a House seat in any manner other than by direct election. The resolution before us today is intended to facilitate the use of the existing constitutional framework. We must make the special election process work better, and work faster.  H. Res. 559 would request the States to re-examine their laws governing the conduct of special elections to the House. It does not require them to do so. It does not force them to change their laws, but it is intended to remind them of the potential disadvantages of their failure to do so--the loss of representation in the House for an extended period of time in the event of a future national catastrophe.  Special elections to the House are normally conducted pursuant to provisions of State law and regulations. We have not made uniform statutory requirements for special elections, preferring to leave it to the States to choose methods which reflect their unique politics and culture. One size does not necessarily fit all.  However, the preamble of H. Res. 559 notes the ultimate constitutional authority of the Congress over the conduct of all congressional elections. The provisions of article 1, section 4 state that `` . . . the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations.''  Congress does have the power to pass a national statute governing the conduct of special elections. Such a statute would not be easy to draft, however, and might be opposed by States which prefer to use their own approaches. We would like to avoid this option, if possible, but it remains on the table.  Congress also has the power to pass and send to the States for ratification a constitutional amendment providing for some different method of filling vacancies. The problem with this approach is that it is extremely difficult and time-consuming and could take years, and there is no consensus on which method of filling vacancies to use in any such amendment.  While special elections are conducted by States, this is clearly a national problem and challenge. If enough States fail to elect new Representatives quickly, the House might find itself controlled for a time by a much smaller group of Members, unrepresentative perhaps geographically or ideologically of the American people.  The disruption to the legitimacy of the Congress and to the political and legislative process would be extraordinary.  The average time for the filling of a vacant House seat in the event of a Member's death, according to the Commission on Continuity in Government of the Brookings Institution and the American Enterprise Institute, is approximately 125 days. In my own case, having been elected to the House in a special election in 1981, it was 89 days. In some States the process of replacing a deceased or resigned Member can take as long as 6 months.  In the event of a catastrophe resulting in the deaths of many Members of House, it will be essential to replenish this body as soon as practicable to ensure that the House remains a body representative of, and responsive to, the American people. We simply cannot wait for States to react using existing laws which have not been seriously examined in decades, and which, of course, were never intended to be used in a time of emergency. The result of such laws will be that some States will remain unrepresented as the House, the Senate, the President, and the country take necessary actions to respond to, and to move beyond, such a future crisis.  So, Mr. Speaker, it is clearly in the interest of the States to ensure their full and continued representation as quickly as possible, just as it is in the interest of the House to move as quickly as possible back to a full complement of Members deliberating once again with the broadest possible range of views.  I believe that it would be appropriate for the committee with jurisdiction over congressional elections, the House Administration Committee, to hold hearings on this subject during the next Congress.  We can then evaluate any actions taken by the States in response to the 9/11 crisis, and to this resolution, and get a broader picture of the actual mechanics involved in conducting such elections.  We need to remind ourselves that, in the event special elections occur in large numbers, whether under current laws or new ones, that they may not be occurring under ideal circumstances at some future time.  There may be problems printing the ballots, setting up the polls, or completing many other steps incident to the proper conduct of an election which are complicated enough during normal times, as we have seen yet again recently in the state of Florida.  Mr. Speaker, this resolution sounds an alarm to the States that they have a pivotal role to play in ensuring the stability of our constitutional system. I urge all Members to support it, and all States to respond favorably to it.  I congratulate the gentleman from California (Mr. Cox) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost) for their leadership on this issue. I believe that the States will be responsive and will come up with ideas that hopefully will accomplish the objective of ensuring that in the event of a catastrophe we can replace Members of the House lost in such a catastrophe so that the people's business can be done in this, the people's House.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, and I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost) may control the remainder of the time allotted to me, and that he may yield time.
