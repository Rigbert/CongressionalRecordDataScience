President, this amendment is very straightforward. It has been cleared by both the chairman and ranking member of the Agriculture Committee, and I have also received word that the Risk Management Agency is supportive of this change.  Very simply, the amendment amends the section of the Federal Crop Insurance Act regarding the use of written agreements for commodities in counties where the crop has not yet been approved for crop insurance purposes.  The problem is that 3 years of cropping history is needed in order to issue a written agreement for coverage. However, producers cannot get a history of planting because the banker won't lend the money if they can't get insurance coverage. Thus, it is an endless cycle.  We have many counties where coverage exists for sunflowers, and we would like to use that data to expand coverage to canola. The Risk Management Agency has indicated that this would be an acceptable practice. However, the current law says that data must be used from the same commodity for which the policy is being issued. This amendment simply changes that language to allow data from agronomically similar crops to be used in providing written agreements.  The amendment has been given a score of zero by the CBO, and I urge my colleagues to accept it.  I yield the floor.
