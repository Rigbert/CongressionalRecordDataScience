 Let me start by saying that I brought to the floor a can of infant formula which costs a little bit over 30 cents a can to manufacture and sells retail in our stores for maybe $2.70 a can. As a result of the free enterprise system that we brought to WIC on a bipartisan basis in 1989, as my colleague has said, we get 1 billion dollars' worth of taxpayer efficiency on this program every year.  But what I want to say to my colleagues is that after all the talk of free enterprise that we have heard from the other side this session, as a result of this bill, even with the Roukema amendment, we will be going back to the old days of closed markets and backroom contracting.  We ought to note that the gentlewoman from New Jersey wanted to do this right and to keep competitive bidding. What will happen even with this amendment is a lot of States will not have to do sealed bids which is the way to have real competition. We will also see the infant formula companies going about this country offering inducements to the States to reject competitive bidding and go with cost containment.  I would like to mention that the Federal Trade Commission, the experts there, are alarmed not just about the negative aspects for WIC of eliminating competitive bidding, they have written to me and they have said that by eliminating competitive bidding, we will reduce competition for infant formula in our stores and for the general market.  The reason that is the case is the way these giant infant formula companies get known is to move into the WIC market and get the public familiar with their product.  I just say to my colleagues, particularly on the other side, let us reinvent Government where it does not work. This is an example of a program where free enterprise, that the parties worked on together in 1989, has worked. As a result, we are going to be eliminating competitive bidding. That is going to take milk from the mouths of poor infants and it is going to give cookies and cream to the infant formula companies and that is wrong.  Mr. Chairman, I include the following for the Record.                                     Federal Trade Commission,                                   Washington, DC, March 16, 1995.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     U.S. House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Representative Wyden: Chairman Steiger forwarded a      copy of your March 8, 1995 letter to me and asked that I      respond to your inquiries. In that letter, you indicated that      the House Economic and Education Opportunities Committee had      voted to end the competitive bidding requirement for infant      [[Page H3589]] formula contracts that are part of the Special      Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children      (``WIC''). You also noted that three companies dominate the      infant formula industry and you pointed to a possible effect      in the general retail market from eliminating bidding      requirements in the WIC Program, namely, that it might      discourage new companies from entering the infant formula      market. In this regard, you asked that, based on our      experience in dealing with competitive issues related to the      WIC and general retail market for infant formula, we respond      to a series of questions.       I should point out that while I have not studied the      proposed legislation to which you referred, I have been      involved in lengthy litigations relating to the WIC and      general retail markets for infant formula, and I am able to      provide you with my views on the questions you have raised.      These views, of course, are my own and do not necessarily      reflect the views of the Commission or any individual      Commissioner. This response does not provide any non-public      information and, accordingly, I do not request confidential      treatment.       1. Do you believe that eliminating competitive bidding for      infant formula in the WIC market will discourage competition      in the general market for infant formula? Please explain.       I agree with your assessment that competitive bidding in      the WIC program makes entry into the infant formula market      easier. I also agree that to the extent that competitive      bidding in the WIC market is eliminated or made less likely,      then competition in the general retail market for infant      formula would be adversely affected.       The infant formula market is highly concentrated, with      three companies accounting for the vast majority of sales. As      I describe below, concentrated markets, sometimes referred to      as oligopolies, often result in higher prices for consumers      whether or not the companies have engaged in unlawful      collusion, particularly where the companies sell a      homogeneous product and there are high barriers to entry.       Entry into a concentrated market can have significant      procompetitive effects in a variety of ways. First, new entry      into a concentrated market will make it more difficult for      the existing companies to collude. For example, in a given      market otherwise susceptible to collusion, a price-fixing      agreement among three companies is easier to achieve and      maintain than would be an agreement among four companies. The      fourth company not only adds a forth party that must be      convinced to violate the law, but it also is likely to have      different incentives than the other companies by virtue of      its smaller market share. Expansion may be a more profitable      strategy than collusion if the company's share is small.       Second, even absent collusion, companies in an oligopoly      act interdependently. That is, each company recognizes that      its pricing decisions affect others in the industry. For      example, if one firm raises prices above the competitive      level in an oligopoly, the other firms independently      recognize that they have two choices. They can raise prices a      similar amount, resulting in each company increasing profits.      Alternatively, they can maintain their prices, resulting in      the price leader being forced to withdraw its price increase      so as not to lose market share, resulting in each of the      companies forgoing the opportunity for increased profits.      Prices in an oligopoly, accordingly, are often higher than      they would be in a competitive market. If new entry occurs in      such a market, the likelihood of the incumbent firms being      able to continue their interdependent conduct is lessened.       Finally, in general, when additional productive capacity      and supply created by a new firm is added to the market, that      additional supply will also have a downward effect on price.      Other things being equal, as the supply of a product goes up,      prices tend to go down.       Competitive bidding in the WIC Program makes entry into the      market easier because a new or small company can, by winning      one bid, assure itself of a large portion of the market for      an extended period of time. The WIC segment of the market      accounted for approximately 40% of infant formula sales in      the early 1990's. Winning a WIC bid also effectively assures      the winning company of obtaining significant shelf space at      retail outlets, which can result in what the industry refers      to as ``spill-over'' sales in the non-WIC retail market. The      brand name recognition resulting from the significant shelf      space typically given to the WIC bid winner is a substantial      benefit to the winning company. Finally, obtaining a large      WIC contract also can help the company achieve economies of      scale in the production of formula, allowing the company to      sell at lower prices to non-WIC consumers.       2. What is your best estimate of the impact of eliminating      competitive bidding for WIC infant formula contracts? Please      explain the likely effects on WIC users and federal      taxpayers.       Early in the history of the WIC Program, the USDA observed      that individual state WIC programs that used sole source      competitive bidding systems obtained larger savings than      those that used ``open market'' systems preferred by the      infant formula companies. Under an open market system, all      companies can participate in the program, and WIC      participants can choose any company's product.       Because of competitive pressures associated with bidding      for a sole source contract, where sole source bidding was      required the amounts of rebates offered by the formula      companies escalated over time. These rebates allowed the      states to add additional families to the WIC Program, thereby      serving more people with the federal grant.       These sole source rebates benefitted people in other states      as well. Under competitive bid procedures, the states often      received rebates that were high enough that the state itself      did not need the entire amount of the rebate. In such cases,      rebate funds were returned to USDA where the money was      reallocated to other states.       As described below, some state WIC programs, in the absence      of a federal requirement that there be competitive bidding,      preferred that open market systems be utilized. This      preference for open market systems in some states existed      despite the understanding that competitive bids resulted in      lower infant formula prices and despite the understanding      that the federal government preferred competitive bidding.       Competitive bidding has been shown to result in many      millions of dollars in savings to the federal taxpayer. If      competitive bidding requirements are eliminated, states may      again choose to forego competitive bid programs in favor of      open market systems that provide significantly lower levels      of rebates. In other words, states may choose to opt for      programs, paid for by the federal government, that result in      higher infant formula prices.       3. What are the factors that tend to increase the      likelihood of anti-competitive collusion by companies and are      these factors present in the infant formula market?       Anticompetitive behavior is more likely in markets where      sales are concentrated in the hands of few sellers, where the      product at issue is relatively homogeneous, where the firms      selling the product are relatively homogeneous, and where      there are high barriers to entry.       The infant formula market has these very characteristics.      The top three firms accounted for in excess of 90% of the      market in the early 1990's. Federal standards for nutritional      quality and safety make infant formula a relatively      homogeneous product. Each of the top three firms selling      infant formula is a pharmaceutical company; each is similarly      integrated; and each markets formula in a similar fashion.      Finally, barriers to entry into the manufacture and sale of      infant formula are high.       4. Last year, the state of California decided rather than      bid out a new WIC formula cost containment contract, they      would extend the existing contract for another year. However,      because of the 1987 competitive bidding statute, the USDA      required them to re-bid the contract at the end of the year.       This process saved the taxpayer $22.4 million in the cost      of infant formula. A similar situation in South Carolina      ended up saving taxpayers $8.97 million in the cost of infant      formula.       From past FTC investigations and current information you      may have available, what pressures and incentives do the      infant formula companies use to keep states from bidding out      infant formula contracts?       Under the sole source competitive bid procedures, with      exceptions being made for physician prescriptions, WIC      participants must use one brand of formula. Although all of      the brands meet statutory nutritional requirements, some      parents prefer one brand over another and made their feelings      known to the state WIC director. To avoid dissatisfaction of      some WIC participants, some WIC directors prefer the open      market system under which parents can choose any brand of      formula.       Because the infant formula companies preferred the more      profitable open market system, they were willing to provide      the state WIC programs with rebates under an open market      system. These open market rebates, though in some cases      convincing state WIC programs to opt for open market      programs, were considerably lower than the rebates that could      be obtained through competitive bidding.       In addition, formula companies and state WIC programs can      structure open market rebates in a way that may meet the      state's needs but that result in smaller savings for the      federal government. For example, in 1990 in Puerto Rico, a      system was put into place under which an open market was      permitted by the local WIC program as long as the companies      were willing to provide payments, outside of the WIC program,      to the Puerto Rico health care system. These side payments      were not returnable to the federal government as would be      rebate payments not used by the program. Under this system,      the formula companies offered WIC rebates equal to      approximately $6.5 million in 1991. In 1992, after a      competitive bid, the winning company's bid was estimated to      result in an annual rebate of approximately $23.4 million.
