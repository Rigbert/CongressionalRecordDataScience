President, this really wasn't the week of the Senator from Vermont. In an article in the Wall Street Journal on Monday, ``The Myth of the Climate Change `97%,' '' they say the 97 percent figure came from 79 respondents out of 3,146.  Secondly, today is the day they finalized the annual Gallup poll. The Gallup poll came out and made the statements that came to the conclusion that the current level of worry on global warming and climate remains at record lows, right behind the loss of tropical rain forests.  So don't vote for this based on the assumption that the 97 percent figure is accurate or that people care that much.
