Speaker, I thank the majority leader for the information. I want to assure the leader, as he says we ought to be, that the Members on this side are, in fact, prepared to spend the time necessary to address the important issues, as the leader requests. And I want to assure the leader of our cooperation in being ready to do our work.  Mr. Leader, initially, may I ask, the motions to instruct, can the gentleman give us a time when those might occur, and will they occur relatively close to the votes, the suspension votes at the end of the day? I yield to my friend.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. As the gentleman knows, we have three appropriations bills that are out there that are eligible for motions to instruct. I do not know of any others. They are available when those Members want to bring a motion to instruct, and we are trying to fit them in as best we can during the week.
