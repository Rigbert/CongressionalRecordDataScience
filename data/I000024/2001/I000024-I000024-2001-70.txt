     Unlike the Department's proposed legislation on Vieques,      however, the amendment does not provide for a date certain      departure. Nonetheless, the Department believes that the      amendment does not constrain the Department's ability to      define and meet its training needs and the target departure      date may still be achieved. To the extent that the amendment      offered by Senator Inhofe, SA 1595, is not inconsistent with      the Department's legislative proposal and underlying intent,      we interpose no objection.  I ask unanimous consent this entire letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       Department of the Navy,                                Washington, DC, 24 September 2001.     Hon. Carl Levin,     Chairman, Senate Armed Services Committee,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Levin: As you are aware, the Department of      Defense previously submitted proposed legislation that would      eliminate the requirement in Section 1503 of the Floyd D.      Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year      2001, requiring a referendum among the Vieques electorate on      whether the people of Vieques approve or disapprove of the      continuation of training beyond May 1, 2003. Consistent with      the commitments made by both the President and the Department      of the Navy, the Navy is actively planning to discontinue      training operations on the island of Vieques in May of 2003      and is committed to identifying alternatives to Vieques from      both a geographical and technological standpoint to provide      effective military training. Consequently, a referendum      regarding continuation of training past this point in time is      no     longer necessary. I still believe that conducting a local      referendum on issues critical to the Department of Defense      sets a bad precedent and strikes at the heart of military      readiness. Enacting legislation that does away with this      requirement will avoid such a precedent and potential domino      effect on our other military training ranges.       Senator Inhofe's amendment, SA 1595, supports the Defense      Department's request to repeal the local referendum and      provides for transfer of the eastern property to the      Department of Interior, following cessation of training.      Unlike the Department's proposed legislation on Vieques,      however, the amendment does not provide for a date certain      departure. Nonetheless, the Department believes that the      amendment does not constrain the Department's ability to      define and meet its training needs and the target departure      date may still be achieved. To the extent that the amendment      offered by Senator Inhofe, SA 1595, is not inconsistent with      the Department's legislative proposal and underlying intent,      we interpose no objection.           Sincerely,                                                Gordon R. England,                                            Secretary of the Navy.
