 President, I am pleased to introduce a bipartisan bill today that gives Native American tribes a chance to protect their reservation lands from catastrophic fire. I want to thank my cosponsors, Chairman Pete Domenici of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and Chairman Ben Nighthorse Campbell of the Committee on Indian Affairs.  Like other Americans, many Native American tribes are concerned about the risk of catastrophic forest fires spreading from nearby Federal lands onto their own lands. Last summer, at least 18 reservations were invaded by fire from adjacent Federal public forest lands.  This bill attempts to give the tribes a chance to defend themselves and their ancestral lands by involving them in brush-clearing projects on Federal lands near their reservations.  This is not just a theoretical problem, as tribes from my State know all too well.  Last fall's devastating wildfires in southern California caused disproportionate suffering for Native Americans: Over 30,000 acres burned on 11 tribal reservations. Most tragically, 10 lives were lost on or near reservations.  I am determined to give the tribes of my State and from around the country the opportunity to prevent this tragedy from recurring: The bill sets up a process for the Forest Service or the Bureau of Land Management to enter into contracts with the tribes for fuel reduction purposes. If a tribe requests a brush-clearing project on federal lands near its reservation, the agencies are encouraged to respond within specific timeframes and suggest remedies for any agency concerns with the tribe's proposal. There remains free and open competition for timber contracts on Federal land. However, in determining the recipients of the contracts, the agencies are encouraged to consider such factors as tribal treaty rights or cultural and historical affiliation to the land involved.  Nearly 100 Native American tribes support this legislation, including most, if not all, the tribes in the State of California.  So I am pleased to introduce this bill today, and I hope my colleagues will support it.                                 ______                                       By
