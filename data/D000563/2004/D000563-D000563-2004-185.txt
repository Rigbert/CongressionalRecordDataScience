People can't afford prescription drugs. They can't afford college tuition. They can't deal with health insurance costs. They can't deal with these rising gas prices.  Here is the problem. We need to create a special interest group called Working Families in America. Wouldn't it be great if they had a lobby here? Wouldn't it be great if we walked out in that hallway and men in three-piece suits and Gucci loafers were representing working families in America? There are plenty out there for the drug companies, plenty out there for the health insurance companies. But this Senate and this Congress only responds to special interest groups and those are groups such as the pharmaceutical companies that have record profits at the expense of consumers across America.  When are we ever going to address issues that real families care about? If we are not here to address those issues, then, frankly, we ought to just close up shop and go home, and I don't think we should. I think we have a responsibility to stay here and work and make certain that we deal with the issues real families care about instead of all these special interest groups that come in.  Now they want to get rid of class actions. They have said class actions, that is a dirty phrase. We should not say that in America because the people who go to court and sue on behalf of a large group of people have no business doing it. They are frivolous lawsuits. They are unproductive.  Then take a look at those class action lawsuits. Those end up being lawsuits by consumers across America who may have just lost $100 personally, but when aggregated turn out to be a large group of people who have created a great profit for a company that didn't deserve it.  Those are ways that Americans speak to the issues that concern them. Those are opportunities which the Republican majority wants to silence.  I yield the floor.
