 President, reserving the right to object, and I will have to object, I wish to say to my good friend, the majority leader, I thought over the last couple of hours we would be able to get consent to have votes on the Mikulski and Murkowski amendments. But I had indicated to him, and I want to say publicly, that we have a number of speakers interested in speaking on the Medicare issue and the McCain motion. So I will not be able to lock in the McCain motion or the side-by-side that I gather under this consent request my good friend, the majority leader, may offer.  I would still like to be able to get the two votes earlier referred to--the Mikulski and Murkowski amendments--but regretfully I cannot even lock those in right now. But I want to do that as soon as possible so at least we can get those two votes at some point reasonably early in the day and turn back to debate on the McCain motion.  I might say, we want to vote on the McCain motion. We certainly have no desire to delay that vote. But we do have a number of people who want to speak to it. With that understanding and with the point I want to make to my good friend that I want to get the two amendments by Mikulski and Murkowski locked in as soon as possible, I must object.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Objection is heard.  The Senator from Alabama.
