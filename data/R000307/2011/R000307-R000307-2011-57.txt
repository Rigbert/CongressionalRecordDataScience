President, I rise today to honor the hard work and dedication of our men and women in the U.S. Army and all branches of service.  Just a couple of weeks ago, I had the pleasure of attending the uncasing ceremony at Fort Riley, KS. It was an honor. For those who have not attended an uncasing ceremony, it symbolizes a homecoming, and certainly that was the case at Fort Riley. It signifies the presence of the command and resumption of that command's authority. It offers a time to reflect on the heroic efforts and the leadership of the men and women of the Big First.  Since returning to Kansas in 2006, the 1st Infantry Division's headquarters deployed to Iraq. But this was not the first time the division has uncased its colors at Fort Riley. In fact, it was the fifth time in 55 years.  During their time in Basra, Iraq, the men and women of the Big Red One assisted in completing many vital projects.  Approximately 850 soldiers deployed from Fort Riley in February of last year. The division's efforts were supported by other services and also government agencies. The mission was more offensive than defensive--a change for the men and women of the Big Red One.  To quote Fort Riley's outstanding commanding general, MG Vincent Brooks:       The Big Red One as U.S. Division-South was a trusted      partner to the Iraqi Security Forces, to 9 U.S. Provincial      reconstruction teams led by the U.S. Department of State,      with participants from other agencies of the U.S. Government,      and to other U.S. forces in Iraq, the Big Red One ensured      that the hard-earned stability emerging in Iraq would never      drift away. Their success was our success.  The accomplishments of the Big Red One are numerous and merit the attention of my colleagues.  The division assisted Iraqis in completing the Basra Children's Hospital, a cancer center noted as one of the most modern facilities in the Middle East.  I was fortunate to spend time at the ceremony with about 30 soldiers in the unit. One noncommissioned officer in particular stood out. I asked all of them how many deployments they had made to Iraq or, for that matter, Afghanistan, and the answers were two or three or four. But this one noncommissioned officer had five deployments. I asked him what on Earth was wrong with the deployment situation in his case. He said: Oh, no, I wanted to come back to my unit, to the Big Red One; I wanted to come back to Iraq and continue the work I thought was so important. I asked him what the difference was, and he said: Well, when I was here first in Iraq, we lost nine in our unit; nine paid the ultimate sacrifice. But in this deployment, no shots were fired.  If there ever was testimony from somebody on the front line, and obviously the NCOs run the Army, with due respect to the officers, but he summed it up pretty well: first deployment, nine fatalities; last deployment, no shots fired.  I am truly grateful that all of the soldiers deployed from the Big Red One's division headquarters returned safe this time around.  By the way, General Vincent Brooks, remember that name as I am sure you will hear it again, will soon be receiving his third star and will be reassigned to the Central Command. Anyone who knows General Brooks and his wife, Dr. Carole Brooks, is not surprised. This promotion in the new command comes as no surprise to anyone in the area, especially the people who served under General Brooks and have had the privilege of knowing him. Simply put, he is an inspirational leader with an outstanding record.  From the Kansas congressional delegation, General, well done, sir. You will be missed, but our pride in your success, your future success, and the job you have done and the job you will do make us all proud. It is a pride we all share.  I ask unanimous consent to have General Brooks's comments printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                          1ID Colors Uncasing                       (By MG Brooks, 20 Jan. 10)       Good morning ladies and gentlemen. I want to first thank      the division band, the CG's Mounted Color Guard, Salute      Battery outside in the cold air--you both look and sound      great. You look and sound great and you make it possible for      us to be back.       We are joined today by many distinguished guests. Let me      first begin by saying thanks to Governor Sam Brownback,      Senator Pat Roberts--it seems we cannot have an important      ceremony without a major snowstorm--we certainly appreciate      you honoring us by taking the journey here to come here under      the conditions to be with us today. We're just honored by      your presence. Our civilian aide to the Secretary of the      Army. Other distinguished local, state and national elected      officials or their representatives, all of whom serve as      champions for the interests of Fort Riley in their official      capacities. Our friends from Kansas State University also who      had the opportunity to witness first-hand the great work our      soldiers in Iraq and the real opportunity that exists in      Iraq--we thank them for being bold enough to make the      journey. As I turn and look at this crowd I see many faces of      friends. Faces we have come to know not only as neighbors and      colleagues, but as dear friends.       Thank you all for joining us today as the division      headquarters symbolically and ceremonially returns from      accomplishing our mission and as we bring to a close another      chapter in the history of this great division.       This is a fitting occasion--because uncasing the 1st      Infantry Division Colors at Fort Riley, after accomplishing a      mission overseas has become a well-established practice. For      today marks the 5th time in the last 55 years that these      Colors--the Colors of America's 1st Division in name and in      fact, have been removed from their traveling case and opened      at Fort Riley.       Just as in 1955, 1970, 1991, and 2006, today in 2011 we      again uncase and unfurl these gallant Colors with new history      having been added to the Colors since they were last seen      here. Truly, Fort Riley is the home of the Big Red One and      now that we are back, again, we are truly at home in the      heartland. And it's good to be back home.       I hope you will indulge me for a few moments to tell you a      few highlights of the many accomplishments and achievements      that happened through our time of deployment and to thank      some people along the way. This is going to be a bit longer      than my usual speeches, certainly much longer than the one I      gave on the 3rd of January upon our return. I will do my best      to highlight some remarkable things that happened in our      campaign here as well as our campaign there, overseas. Plus,      it's been a while since most of you haven't had a speech from      me in a year. So I have to make up for some lost time. So      bare with me.       Let me begin by saying that the accomplishments on the      homefront here at Fort Riley were at least as impressive as      those that occurred in southern Iraq. I want to say that      something so that everybody is absolutely certain of that      great team that you have here.       You may recall that in this field house over a year ago the      division headquarters and the Victory 5 marched off to do our      duty first, leaving a rear command supported by a mostly      civilian mission support element and a mostly civilian U.S.      Army garrison command.       Brigadier General David ``Pete'' Petersen and Command      Sergeant Major Darrell ``Buddy'' Wallace took the lead for      Fort Riley, standing forth bravely in what is still, in many      ways, a journey in uncharted waters. You represented the      command exceedingly well and I am very proud of both of you      for all you did to shoulder a very, very heavy load with      really hard work to do. Thanks to your ladies, Karen and      ``Lefty'' also for your grace and patience and support of      these two warriors. General Pete, congratulations on your      upcoming promotion to Major general and recognition. And      Command Sergeant Major Buddy Wallace, congratulations on the      culminating role of a great career as you transition into the      ``U.S. Army--Retired'' ranks.     [Applaud]       Believe me, the rear command would not have succeeded in      the extraordinarily tough work that had to be done if there      had not been a group of professionals, Army civilians, called      the mission support element and led by Mr. Ollie Hunter. They      were the surrogate staff--referred to as the ``M staff''      seated on the right behind BG Petersen and CSM Wallace, and      they were magnificent.       The primary task of generating forces for deployment abroad      fell to you--bringing together the modernization of equipment      with the arrival of personnel to the individual and      collective training that leads to forces ready to be      deployed--from four different bases in four different      states--in a year when every brigade under the division's      responsibility deployed or redeployed, in part or in-toto, in      some cases with a short-notice changes of theater and in some      cases with a significantly shortened period of training--no      matter the circumstances, no matter the curve ball pitched at      you--you knocked it out of the park.       Nothing was normal about what you were asked to do, nothing      was routine, there was no handbook and no standing operating      procedure. Yet, you accomplished the mission in true Big Red      One style, demonstrating what it means to say no mission too      difficult, no sacrifice too great, duty first. Well done.      Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in a round of applause.     [Applaud]       Then, there is the U.S. Army garrison command under the      visionary and persistent leadership of Colonel Kevin Brown,      Ms. Linda Hoeffner, Command Sergeant Major Ian Mann, and      Colonel John Dvoracek all guiding the finest group of      professional civilian directors in the entire Army.       What you have accomplished here in one year is absolutely      amazing--and believe me that is understating the reality.       You moved the Fort Riley Campaign plan 2015, initiated last      January, into a solid set of accomplishments. The opening of      the Army's first warrior transition battalion complex; the      expanded community covenants connecting Fort Riley even more      to the 22 communities around Fort Riley; the start of the      ongoing construction of the Army's newest community hospital;      trail blazing resilience initiatives not only for soldiers      but for military family members as well--programs that have      been recognized as best practices throughout the Army;      attracting national level leaders to come to Fort Riley to      see the premier division level installation, in the making,      and to gain their support for initiatives like military      family housing and school expansion; the forward momentum of      the Flint Hills Regional Council; and the generation of . . .      conservatively . . . over $2.2 billion of revenue for the      state of Kansas.       These accomplishments, ladies and gentlemen, are figurative      ice chips from an iceberg of excellence. I am immensely proud      of the Garrison Command, and ladies and gentlemen please join      me in applauding their efforts.     [Applaud]       I want to take this opportunity also to say thanks to our      community leaders, our neighbors, our friends, for your      patience through the challenges of the last year, and for      your steadfast support not only of the leadership here at      Fort Riley but all the efforts I have already highlighted,      and also of our deployed soldiers and of our families who      stayed behind in the Flint Hills while we were gone.       Believe me when I say we truly could not have done what we      did without you. You are our reason for doing what we do and      we are forever indebted to you and we are joyous to be back      with you again.       Finally, I want to thank the families of the warriors who      were (and I should add: still are) deployed. You carry a      burden that cannot be described adequately, compared      accurately, or appreciated fully. You are our hope and our      inspiration. You are the focus of what we look forward to      while we are gone. You are the finest examples of grace and      strength. Thank you for who you are and for all you give. It      is so good to be back in your embrace.       Ladies and gentlemen, bear with me for just a few more      moments while I highlight what was accomplished by the      soldiers who stand before you and all who served under the      colors of the 1st Infantry Division in its role as United      States Division--South, responsible for all U.S. operations      in the southern half of the country of Iraq, 9 of the 18      provinces--and an area positioned between Iran to the east,      Kuwait to the south and Saudi Arabia to the west. An area      where ancient human history meets the future of the middle      east.       Roughly 850 soldiers deployed from Fort Riley to fulfill      this headquarters mission which we officially began on the      2nd of February 2010 from our headquarters in Basra, the      second largest city in Iraq.       We commanded units from every part of our Army, and were      augmented by Navy, Air Force, Marine and Coast Guard and      other government agency teammates joined together as a pick-     up team that resembled an all-star team.       The deployment was fast-paced, high-stakes, more      psychological than physical, more offensive than defensive,      more indirect than direct.       An abbreviated way to describe our greatest accomplishment      is to say--the Big Red 1 as U.S. Division--South was a      trusted partner to the Iraqi security forces, to 9 U.S.      provincial reconstruction teams led by the U.S. Department of      State with participants from other agencies of the U.S.      Government, and to the other U.S. Forces out there in Iraq,      ensuring that the hard-earned stability emerging in Iraq      would never drift away. Their success was our success.       All we had to do was help Iraq become the sovereign,      stable, and self-reliant strategic partner the U.S. has been      looking for in the Middle East--all in the face of internal      political intrigue and violence, and the ever-present      legitimate and illegitimate influences of neighboring      countries, especially Iran.       Our soldiers faced violence, uncertainty, and danger      courageously while also seizing every emerging every      opportunity to meet the challenges in new and creative ways      that led to remarkable successes and an acceleration of the      stability in southern Iraq well ahead of the rest of the      country.       16 Soldiers lost their lives while serving under the Colors      of the Big Red One, brigades and battalions assigned to us.      They     will forever be a part of our history, they will always be in      our prayers and our thoughts go out to their families. Yet,      thanks be to God, every one of the 850 soldiers who deployed      from Fort Riley as part of the division headquarters returned      safely, despite repeated rocket attacks on our bases,      ambushes against our vehicles, hundreds of hours in aerial      flight, and the harsh conditions of extreme heat, Biblical      dust storms, and unforgiving military equipment.       These are the soldiers who developed the intelligence to      defeat the enemy networks so that they found no sanctuary.       These are the soldiers who planned the operations to      provide the surveillance that supported the Iraqis who then,      on their own, arrested the violent extremists and who taught      the Iraqi investigators and the judges how to gather evidence      that led to convictions under the rule of law.       These are the soldiers who established the satellite      communications to reach everywhere even places where no other      Army unit has been able to extend communications.       These are the soldiers who determined which Iraqis we      should develop relationships with to gain influence, who      committed money like a weapons system to change the      environment around us, who determined which projects should      receive our attention and fought for successful completion      and closure of 628 separate projects.       And these are the soldiers who planned and executed the      drawdown ending operation Iraqi Freedom, beginning operation      New Dawn, including the movement of 1,200 trucks, 14,000      separate pieces of equipment, $286 million dollars worth of      U.S. property, responsibly moved out of the country of Iraq      and the closure of 30 of 58 military bases in southern Iraq      in only 6 months, including the conversion of a former prison      complex into a logistics city for commercial enterprises to      establish themselves.       These are the soldiers who created through their own      initiative a program and center for building resilience even      while deployed.       What a legacy to have been left by 800 Americans.       Ladies and gentlemen, these soldiers have truly added to      the illustrious history of the Big Red 1 and have earned      these decorations Command Sergeant Major Champagne and I      affixed to the Colors and I would ask you please join me in a      round of applause for these warriors.       Iraq is on the pathway to becoming sovereign, stable and      self-reliant and we helped them have a chance. Now we are      home and our attention is turned to rejoining our friends and      loved ones--on building our resilience--and finally on our      Fort Riley 2015 Campaign Plan which continues to move      forward. We will address all of these with the same vigor,      reunited and energized by the growth we have all experienced      over the last 12 months. Exciting times await us. Forward the      Big Red One.       Thank you again for joining us today. May God continue to      bless you all and may his protection be with those who remain      deployed and upon their families.       Duty First.
