The Association, comprised exclusively of Korean War veterans, has over 25,000 members and is one of the few such organizations of its size without a Federal Charter.  Being awarded such a charter will afford the Korean War Veterans Association the same status as other major veterans' organizations and allow it to participate as part of select committees with other congressionally chartered veterans and military groups. A Federal Charter--at no cost to the government--will also accelerate the Association's accreditation with the Department of Veterans Affairs, enabling its members to assist in processing veterans' claims.  More than 50 years have passed since the war-weary men and women who served in Korea returned home. Half a century later, history has revealed that the sacrifices made by these brave soldiers stemmed the expansion of communism and effectively contributed to a more peaceful world.  Granting this Federal Charter is a small expression of our appreciation for the extraordinary courage and sacrifice of our forces in Korea. This bipartisan legislation is an opportunity to express our gratitude and respect for our military, past and present, and to give Korean War veterans the long-awaited recognition they deserve to ensure that the ``forgotten war'' is forgotten no more.                          ____________________
