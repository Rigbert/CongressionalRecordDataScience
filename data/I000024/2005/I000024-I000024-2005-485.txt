President, it is my understanding that the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, is on his way to use his remaining time. While he is doing that, I will comment that the statements that have been made are excellent. We have agreed we will use the remainder of our time. I will use about 10 minutes, whatever time I have, and they will have the last 10 minutes. However, they are not in the Senate right now. We should serve notice we want the concluding remarks as soon as the Senator from New Mexico completes his remarks.
