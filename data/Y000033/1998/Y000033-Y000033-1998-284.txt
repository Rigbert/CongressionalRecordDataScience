Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce a simple bill--a bill to protect the good name of one of America's greatest Presidents, Ronald Reagan.  On February 4 of this year, Mr. Speaker, this body and the other body both overwhelmingly passed legislation renaming National Airport after Ronald Reagan. President Clinton signed the bill into law on February 6, President Reagan's 87th birthday.  Nevertheless, the National Park Service has announced that it intends to thumb its nose at the will of Congress and the President by erecting signs on the George Washington Memorial Parkway that omit President Reagan's name.  This bill prohibits such a move, and requires new signs that use the correct name of the airport. And, if the Park Service decides to go ahead with its plan to thwart the will of Congress, then we will require the signs to be replaced, with the funds coming out of the budget of the director of the National Park Service.  Ronald Reagan is an American hero. Mr. Speaker, the Park Service must not be allowed to rob him of any part of his tremendous legacy.  Mr. Speaker, I insert a copy of the bill for the Record:                                H.R. --       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Ronald Reagan National      Airport Preservation and Protection Act of 1998''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds that--       (a) Ronald Reagan is an American hero deserving of      recognition;       (b) the will of the Congress to honor President Reagan was      clearly expressed when both Houses overwhelmingly passed      legislation changing the name of ``Washington National      Airport'' to ``Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport'' on      February 4, 1998;       (c) the will of President Clinton to honor President Reagan      was clearly expressed when he signed such legislation into      law on February 6, 1998, the 87th birthday of President      Reagan;       (d) notwithstanding the fact that the will of the Congress      and the President had been clearly expressed through passage      of such legislation and signing such legislation into law,      the National Park Service (NPS) has recently announced that      it intends to erect new signs on the George Washington      Memorial Parkway directing motorists to Ronald Reagan      National Airport that omit Ronald Reagan's name.     SEC. 3. PROHIBITION OF SIGNS OMITTING RONALD REAGAN'S NAME.       (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the      Director of the National Park Service--       (1) shall not erect any new signs on, near, or adjacent to      the George Washington Memorial Parkway in Northern Virginia,      Maryland, the District of Columbia, or elsewhere, displaying      the name ``National Airport'', but omitting the name ``Ronald      Reagan.''.       (2) shall, on or before August 5, 1998, replace all signs      on, near, or adjacent to the George Washington Memorial      Parkway in Northern Virginia, Maryland, the District of      Columbia, or elsewhere, displaying the name ``National      Airport'' with signs prominently displaying the name ``Ronald      Reagan National Airport.''       (3) shall fund the replacement pursuant to subsection (2)      of any signs that had been erected after February 4, 1998,      entirely out of the budget of the Director of the National      Park Service.                               ____________________
