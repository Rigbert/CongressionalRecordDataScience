Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Of course, the Acting Chief of Staff, who is, I think, also the acting head of OMB--not technically but actually, in my view--he said there was a quid pro quo. Now, he tried to clean it up. I get that. I get that.  But he said, yes, there was a quid pro quo.  And you read the transcript--which is not a transcript but a report of the substance of the conversation--in which he brings up a number of things, including Joe Biden and Hunter Biden.  And, yes, we now have testimony that says there was a quid pro quo. There was going to be no meeting at the White House. There was going to be no sending of the $391 million that we thought was essential for our Ukrainian friends defending democracy in Ukraine from Putin.  Now, we have had a more recent action where a telephone conversation with Erdogan led to another headline on that same page: Russia and Turkey reach deal on Syria. America in retreat. America no longer a factor in trying to bring peace.                              {time}  1900  Mr. Speaker, I asked a question. Is the President above the law?  I asked another question: Is it right to keep the $391 million that we appropriated because we thought Ukraine was at great risk? And again, the question wasn't answered. It was answered with a question and with an assertion that the President had the authority to make sure that there wasn't corruption in Ukraine.  Mr. Speaker, we are concerned whether there is corruption in the United States of America. That concerns us, and that is why these hearings are proceeding, consistent with our constitutional duty.  And all the Republicans can do is--not defend the actions, because they are indefensible. All they can do is talk about process.  One thousand subpoenas issued by Dan Burton when he was the Republican chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. One hundred subpoenas, unilaterally, under the Gowdy rule, under the Pompeo rule, under the Republican rules, unilaterally.  Trey Gowdy, himself, as chairman of the Benghazi Select Committee, three dozen subpoenas, without any input, under the Gowdy-Pompeo rules.  So I ask the gentleman, do you think it is consistent with our Constitution that the President of the United States suggest to a foreign leader that they become involved in our elections?
