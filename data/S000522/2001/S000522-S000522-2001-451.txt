Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing legislation to provide targeted tax relief to all workers who are laid off and who receive severance benefits, and to grant re-training assistance to older workers who often have special difficulties when trying to find new employment after a lay-off.  My legislation would allow all workers, of any age, to exclude up to $15,000 from their taxable income for severance pay, effective after the date of enactment.  This legislation is based on the common-sense principle that having one's employment terminated is painful enough for a family to deal with. Clearly, the federal government should not make matters worse by levying additional taxes on non-recurring severance payments.  Severance benefits often create the impression of affluence on paper, and when they are counted as ordinary income (as is the case under current law). The payments boost family incomes into higher tax brackets, and result in higher tax liability. In many cases, a sizeable portion of the severance benefit is lost to the I.R.S. in the form of higher taxes.  This glitch in our tax code was brought to my attention several years ago by a constituent of mine, Mr. Bill Giovennetti of Hamilton, when he told me that he lost thousands of dollars of his severance benefits when he was forced to take early retirement in the early 1990s, as his company was downsizing. Because he was a long-time employee, his severance benefit was fairly significant, and it put him into a higher tax bracket. He protested this taxation to the I.R.S., thinking initially that it was some kind of mistake. Common sense would suggest that the I.R.S. would not want to kick a man when he's down on his luck and out of a job by hiking his taxes and taking away part of his severance package. When he got the letters back from the I.R.S. telling him that severance pay is included and taxed as regular income, he couldn't believe it.  His case is not the first, nor will it be the last, unless this legislation becomes law.  Current law on taxing severance pay has no policy justification. Severance pay is not recurring income. Including it as income distorts a person's true financial situation and makes them appear more wealthy. However, the fact of the matter is that the family's actual financial situation has been weakened by the impending lay-off. The non-recurring nature of severance payments is not recognized by our tax code, and in effect, current law is harshest on those workers who put in the longest years of service to their employer. People should not suffer a tax penalty merely because they have been loyal, longstanding employees, and my legislation provides necessary and needed tax relief to middle class families.  The exclusion can be taken either in the year the severance payment is received, or in one of the next two succeeding taxable years. I have capped the exclusion at $15,000, to ensure that taxpayers are helping those who really need our assistance, not padding the ``golden parachute'' bonuses of CEOs.  Mr. Speaker, since the horrible events of September 11, literally tens of thousands of workers--particularly those in the airline, travel, and tourism industries--have been laid off. Over 100,000 lay offs are anticipated in the airline industry alone when all is said and done. Our economy has taken a body blow, and we will need to provide our laid-off workers all the help we can give so that they can land on their feet.  Severance payments are more than just a reward for service. Severance benefits often are used by laid-off workers as seed capital to start their own businesses. They are used for retraining purposes, such as tuition or fees for specialized training programs. Taxing these benefits is like throwing an anchor to a drowning swimmer. Instead of being a tax albatross, severance payments should be a lifeline that unemployed workers can rely upon when trying to find another job.  Not all workers who are laid off find it easy to get another job that pays wages similar to their last job. In fact, older workers --especially those over the age of 50--often experience major difficulties. To address this problem, my legislation provides a $2,000 targeted refundable tax credit for displaced older workers to help them with retraining expenses.  Workers over age 50 usually have spent most (or all) of their careers at the same firm, and often experience difficulties finding new employment after suffering a lay off. This is the result of a number of factors, including: (1) middle-aged employees do not always receive continuous training, and therefore existing job skills might be obsolete in the current job market, (2) the middle aged employee often has higher salary requirements than other workers seeking employment in his or her field, (3) prospective employers are often reluctant to invest additional training in older workers because the firm will not be able to recoup that investment before the employee retires, and (4) the terminated employee may need to switch industries entirely, necessitating training, since the old industry skills are specialized and not easily transferable.  Since the employer often does not have an incentive to invest in retraining for older workers, this tax credit will help individuals retrain and find new employment so that they may be gainfully employed for a period of time before retirement.  Because only workers over age 50 can claim the $2,000 credit, this should significantly reduce the costs of the credit, and it also targets the relief where it is most needed. The credit is also refundable, so it can be claimed as a refund even if the person has no taxable income. In this way, the legislation is certain to benefit lower-income workers.  The qualified retraining expenses under the bill are for items such as tuition and fees, books, supplies, equipment for college or technical retraining courses, and/or meals and lodging at an educational institution.  There is a means test which affects those earning over $100,000 for a married person filing jointly, $75,000 for an individual, or $50,000 for a married person filing separately. The value of the credit steadily diminishes for those earning over these amounts. The means test was included to ensure the retraining credit is targeted to help the middle class.  Lastly, my bill initiates a comprehensive study on the special needs of displaced older workers. As many of my colleagues know, federal job assistance programs ought to be tailored to meet the various needs of workers seeking new jobs. Anecdotal evidence suggests older workers may have unique retraining needs. This study will focus on the needs of such workers, and help agencies meeting these needs decide how existing programs should be improved.  The bill would require the General Accounting Office (GAO) to study the special needs of older (age 50+) displaced workers, and would examine: (1) the unique differences in needs between older and younger workers trying to find a job after a lay off, (2) an assessment of whether current programs adequately meet these special needs (if any) of older workers, (3) an assessment of whether older workers are disproportionately and negatively impacted by job losses attributable to international trade, and (4) an assessment of whether the private sector has sufficient incentives to invest in worker retraining for older workers.  Mr. Speaker, our workers who have suffered a lay off need our help. In the wake of September 11, we now have two enemies to fight: terrorism and recession. My proposal is just one component of the effort to get our economy moving again and to help unemployed workers regain their financial footing.s                          ____________________
