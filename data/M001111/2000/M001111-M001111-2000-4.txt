 President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a number of statements regarding Senator Gorton and his distinguished service. I want to take particular note of the statement by our colleague, Joe Lieberman, who could not be here today. Senator Gorton and Senator Lieberman worked on many initiatives over the years. I want to read his statement:       Mr. President, I wish to express my greatest respect and      affection for Slade Gorton of Washington with whom I have      enjoyed working closely for a number of years. Slade's life      is characterized by his commitment to faith, family, service,      and law. As he leaves the Senate, I want to reminisce about      some of the matters I have been privileged to work with Slade      Gorton.       Over the years, Senator Slade Gorton has been a great      leader on educational reform, striving to raise the      performance of our nation's elementary and secondary schools      and the quality of education so that all children may reach a      high level of academic achievement. The senior Senator for      Washington and I have worked together on a number of      proposals to improve our educational system. His      contributions have led the way for better educational      accountability and innovation in the years ahead.       Of great importance to our country are Slade Gorton's      continued efforts to preserve and honor American history by      calling for stronger history curriculum standards and      literacy awareness in our colleges and universities. I truly      believe such endeavors help to unite our nation by      demonstrating the importance of our shared heritage and civic      culture as Americans.       One of my most memorable experiences with Slade was the      work we did together after the House impeached President      Clinton. All of us in the Senate knew that how we handled the      impeachment trial would test us all--both individually and as      an institution. We could either fall into intense      partisanship, miring ourselves and the country in lengthy and      disruptive proceedings that threatened to leave this      institution demeaned and scarred, or we could rise above      partisanship and join together in a way that preserved this      body's dignity while at the same time ensuring a full airing      of the issues before us.       Slade took the lead in guiding us to a dignified path,      formulating a plan that ultimately formed the basis of the      process the Senate adopted. Notwithstanding his personal      views, his love for his country and this institution led him      to put principle above partisanship and to formulate a plan      for resolving the impeachment case before it wreaked more      havoc on the Senate and the nation. I was delighted to work      on that plan with him, and was impressed again by the      civilized, thoughtful, and nonpartisan way in     which Slade Gorton proceeded. I truly believe that his      leadership was instrumental in seeing the Senate through that      difficult time with honor.       Slade Gorton leaves the Senate with much to be proud of,      and much to look forward to. For my wife and myself, I send      Slade and Sally and their wonderful family love and every      good wish for the next great chapter of their lives.  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record several editorials regarding Senator Gorton's long service to our State of Washington.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:     Statement by Senator Murray in Tribute to Senator Slade Gorton       Mr. President, congressional lame duck sessions following      an election are a rarity. They usually arise when Congress is      unable to finish its business in a timely fashion and that is      true with this year as well. But this session affords me and      this Congress an opportunity to acknowledge and pay tribute      to the service of an esteemed colleague. Senator Slade      Gorton, the senior Senator from Washington state, will be      ending his service here after 18 years in the Senate.       Washingtonians regardless of party affiliation have come up      to me with high praise and appreciation for Senator Gorton's      long service to our state, our country and this proud      institution. I want to share with my colleagues a passage      from an editorial this week in the Everett Herald. The Herald      editorial reads, ``History will rank Gorton with Senator      Henry M. `Scoop' Jackson and Senator Warren G. Magnuson as an      extraordinary leader in D.C. on behalf of the state.      Throughout his career in the Senate and state government,      Gorton has been a leading force in many major efforts to      protect the environment. He also has been a consistent,      passionate advocate for individuals with problems dealing      with bureaucracy. Within the Senate, Gorton has been a grand      force for reasoned bipartisanship, never afraid to take a      strong stand but also willing to work graciously and      effectively with members of the opposition even at the      tensest moments.''       Many of our colleagues are well aware of Slade's history of      public service. As a young man, Slade Gorton moved to      Washington state from Chicago almost 50 years ago. He want to      go West in search of new opportunities. And with $300 and a      one-way ticket on a Greyhound bus, Slade Gorton moved to      Washington state.       History has shown that this Midwest native fit right into      Washington state. Like so many immigrants to our great state,      Slade Gorton was welcomed and given an opportunity to make      the most of his talents.       From the very beginning, Slade Gorton went to work on      behalf of Washington state. First, he married Sally Clark      from Selah, Washington. That same year--1958--Slade went into      politics and was elected to the Washington State House of      Representatives. In the Washington House, Slade rose to serve      as the Majority Leader.       In 1968, he was elected Attorney General of Washington      state. On numerous occasions on several historic cases, Slade      represented the people of Washington before the Supreme      Court. Chief Justice Warren Burger once said that Slade,      ``makes the best arguments before the Supreme Court of any      Attorney General in America.'' He was also recognized with      the prestigious Wyman Award given to the outstanding Attorney      General in the United States.       By this time, Slade had also become a respected leader      throughout Washington state. After three terms as the      Washington state Attorney General, Slade Gorton ran for and      won a seat in the United States Senate. He was elected three      times to the United States Senate--giving him an impressive      record of winning statewide election six times in Washington.       All of this is offered as a brief history of Slade's many      years of service. With time, there will certainly be many      public tributes to Senator Gorton. But what I'd like to focus      on now is our time together in the United States Senate and      the work we were able to do together over the last eight      years.       I am sure all of my colleagues share my own appreciation      for the support, guidance and sacrifices our families make so      that we can serve in the Senate. We rely on them in so many      ways. Slade is fortunate to have such a supportive family.      Sally and Slade have been partners for all of his years of      service. From Olympia, Washington, to Washington, D.C., Sally      Gorton has been there each and every day. She and Slade have      three children and seven grandchildren, who I know bring      immense pride to the Gorton family. So, as we acknowledge and      honor Slade Gorton, I want to pay special tribute to Sally      Gorton and the entire Gorton family.       Much has been said in Washington state about the      differences between Senator Gorton and myself. While Slade      and I have had our differences, not enough has been said      about our ability to work together on behalf of Washington      state. He was a champion for Washington state. When the      interests of Washington state were at stake, we were a great      team. I will miss our ability to work on a bipartisan basis,      combining our strengths, to represent our great state.       As my colleagues know, there is also no greater adversary      in the United States Senate than Slade Gorton. When Senator      Gorton took on an issue, everyone knew they had better      prepare for an energetic and spirited fight. Senators on both      sides of the aisle know what a challenge it is to take on      Senator Gorton.       Most of you didn't have to take those fights home to your      constituencies like I did. But those differences between      Senator Gorton and I were rare. And they were never personal      or vindictive. There were no political vendettas, and we were      always able to move on to the next issue of importance to our      constituents.       Ask the Clinton Administration and the Justice Department      what it is like to take on an issue and differ with Slade      Gorton. He was a champion for Microsoft in its ongoing legal      battles with the Department of Justice. I respected his work      on behalf of Microsoft and was proud to work with him on      behalf of our constituents. And certainly, all of Washington      state appreciated his determined efforts to represent one of      the great symbols of Washington state. Ask the Bush      Administration what it was like to do battle with Slade      Gorton when he fought his own party to save the National      Endowment for the Arts.       Slade Gorton also fought for the United States Senate. When      the Congress was struggling through a very partisan      impeachment process, it was Slade Gorton who along with our      colleague Senator Joe Lieberman stepped forward with a plan      for the Senate. Senator Gorton, in this instance as well as      in many others, had enormous respect for this institution.      That respect for the institution is evident in the respect he      enjoys among all Senators.       Despite Washington D.C.'s strong desire to label us all,      Slade was always open. When he took on a cause, he often      surprised people. Throughout his career in both Washingtons,      Slade defied labels.       Most recently, Senator Gorton and I worked very closely on      the issue of pipeline safety. Unfortunately, a tragedy in      Bellingham, Washington, claimed three young lives and scarred      a community forever. Slade was right there with me from the      very beginning, working to raise the profile of the issue and      eventually to pass through the Senate the toughest pipeline      safety legislation ever adopted by either body of Congress.      Senator Gorton was instrumental to this effort. Working      together, we took on some very powerful interests and      extracted tough compromises.       At the Appropriations Committee, Senator Gorton and I      teamed up in numerous instances each and every year to      advance and protect Washington's many interests from      agriculture research programs benefitting apple growers and      wheat farmers to export promotion programs and land      exchanges.       Washington was fortunate to be the only state whose two      senators both served on the Appropriations Committee. Of      course, Slade chaired the Interior Subcommittee where      Washington has so many interests. We worked together to clean      up the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. We were partners in the      effort to ease the Puget Sound area's very difficult traffic      congestion problems at the Transportation Subcommittee where      we both served.       Beyond the Appropriations Committee, there are so many      other issues that we worked well together on behalf of      Washington state. Commercial fisheries are immensely      important to our state and we worked closely on the Magnuson-     Stevens Act in 1996 and the American Fisheries Act in 1998.      We recently worked together to pay tribute to a Nisei veteran      and Washington state native William Kenzo Nakamura by naming      a courthouse after him in Seattle, Washington.       We worked collaboratively on selecting Federal judges in a      time when confirming judges was overly partisan. We succeeded      in getting our judges through this difficult process by      working together.       Time and again, we both worked to help Boeing in its      relationships with many foreign aircraft customers. Whether      working with USTR or a foreign government, Slade worked hard      for the almost 100,000 Washington state families who work at      Boeing and rely on aircraft sales.       Senator Gorton and I also worked closely on health care      issues important to our constituents. We worked together to      boost the growing biotech sector in our state and the      promising future that companies like Immunex and others are      building in Washington state. From securing research dollars      to representing the UW Medical School, Washington state's      health care needs were well served by the work of Senator      Gorton. Here, like in so many areas, he had a significant and      positive impact on our state. He was a champion on autism      issues, and I regularly worked with him to expand health care      for children.       Effective leaders attract talented people to their offices      and Senator Gorton has always had a very effective staff both      in Washington, DC, and throughout the State of Washington. He      has served as a mentor to literally thousands of      professionals. The family tree of Gorton staffers past and      present is a truly impressive list of Washingtonians. One of      Senator Gorton's greatest and lasting contributions to our      state will be the years of public service his former staffers      will give to Washington state.       My staff and I have worked closely with Senator Gorton's      staff. That working relationship was always interrupted by an      annual softball game that could be as competitive as any      Apple Cup football game between     the University of Washington and Washington State University.      I am proud to say the Murray softball team won its share of      games. But so did the Gorton team. And there were a couple of      years where Senator Gorton himself contributed to his team's      wins. It was a friendly rivalry, but I think Slade will tell      you, we both really wanted to win that game.       The Gorton staff is as loyal as any on Capitol Hill. I am      sure they will have an opportunity to thank Senator Gorton      for all of his personal and professional guidance and      assistance, but I am also sure they would want me to say to      Senator Gorton that they believed in his work and that they      will always be proud to call themselves Gorton staffers.       This is certainly a time of change for the country and for      the Senate. And while Senator Gorton will leave the Senate,      we shouldn't expect to see him fade from the public scene. At      home, he will continue to be a respected leader with perhaps      many opportunities ahead to further shape and influence our      state.       And perhaps his service in Washington, D.C., will continue      as well. I am confident--just as he did almost 50 years ago      on the Greyhound bus--that Senator Gorton will make the most      of the new opportunities to come.       Senator Gorton, on behalf of the people of Washington      state, thank you for your many years of dedicated service.      Thank you for giving your time, your energy, and your wisdom      to people of our state and our country. We have benefitted      enormously from your work and we are grateful for your      service.                                  ____                 [From the Seattle Times, Dec. 5, 2000]                   Gorton's Noteworthy Public Career       There is no particular joy in bidding farewell to the      state's senior senator, Slade Gorton.       This page endorsed his opponent, Maria Cantwell, and we      look forward to the changes in style and policy she can bring      to the job.       But we would be remiss if we failed to pay tribute in this      space to Gorton's distinguished public career. He was first      elected state legislator, then attorney general and has      served three terms as Senator.       Legacy is not a notion that comes easily to Gorton. Late in      the campaign, when asked what was the legacy of his years in      public service, he groped for a response. Perhaps that's      because Gorton's career was not a straight line toward clear      goals or major accomplishments.       As a legislator he was more pragmatist than ideologue. As      his Republican party moved to the right, Gorton feigned just      enough moves in that direction to stay in office, moves that      prompted criticism on this page and elsewhere.       A careful look at the sweep of is career reveals Gorton's      better impulses. He is credited with helping to save the      National Endowment for the Arts and the Forest Legacy      Program, a crucial source of funds for the Mountains to Sound      Greenway project along I-90.       Gorton was one of the saner voices in Congress during the      impeachment. He teamed with his friend, Democratic Sen.      Joseph Lieberman, to broker a middle-ground solution that      would short-circuit a trial. They were unsuccessful, but the      effort is a revealing example of Gorton at work during a      historic time in the nation's Capitol.       Gorton's name is attached to several major accomplishments      from the early years of his career. Lawyer and longtime civic      activist Jim Ellis credits Gorton with steering through the      state legislature the program known as Forward Thrust, a      package of major public works in King County.       Among his most loyal backers is a small army of women who      have worked for Gorton at various stages of his career.       Many have gone on to their own careers in public life.       Now, facing forced retirement by the narrowest of voter      margins, Gorton, 72, can contemplate a life of ongoing      service, possibly in a Bush administration, or better yet, as      a senior statesman in Washington State and the Northwest      where his talents are still welcome and much needed.                                  ____              [From the Tacoma News Tribune, Dec. 5, 2000]         Hold a Place for Gorton Among State's Political Giants                          (By Peter Callaghan)       It's a journalistic must-do.       When a prominent officeholder is defeated, we roll out the      retrospective articles--obituaries for the living.       We attempt to place our politicians in perspective before      we have any.       It's Slade Gorton's turn now. The 72-year-old U.S.      senator's defeat will become official Wednesday.       But he was pretty sure when the first count of votes was      released the day before Thanksgiving when he declared himself      ``cautiously pessimistic'' that a recount would make a      difference.       It didn't. Last Friday the county-by-county tally showed      that Democrat Maria Cantwell's lead actually grew by a few      hundred votes.       So Gorton walked in front of the cameras and the newsies to      make a very short statement. He took no questions.       That left others to pass judgment on a career in politics      that began in 1958. He served 10 years in the state House of      Representatives, 12 as attorney general and 18 in the U.S.      Senate.       Longevity is just one of the reasons he should be      considered for the same status as Warren Magnuson, Dan Evans,      Henry Jackson, Wesley Jones, Julia Butler Hansen and Tom      Foley--giants all.       Impact is another reason. So is presence. So is the breadth      of his legacy.       But there's a much different tone to Gorton's postmortem      than for the others. Much of the space is devoted not to what      he was but to what he wasn't.       He wasn't wildly popular. He wasn't able to generate      affection among voters. He wasn't one to bring home the bacon      in the form of dams and hospitals and military bases.       In a phrase, he wasn't Scoop and Maggie.       This presumes, of course, that Gorton could have been just      like Scoop and Maggie even had he wanted to be. Times had      changed. Gorton was elected in the GOP landslide that ushered      in the Reagan era.       It was a time of lowered expectations of the federal      government. It was a time when the ability to win hundreds of      millions of federal pork was at an end.       Heck, Scoop and Maggie wouldn't be Scoop and Maggie in      times such as those.       But Slade Gorton did manage to build his own legacy as a      smart, savvy politician who was the go-to guy in the      Washington state delegation for much of the last two decades.       If you want your politicians warm and fuzzy, don't knock on      Gorton's door. He was of a generation that didn't believe in      public displays of affection--especially the phony kind      practiced by some politicians.       That he never made an emotional connection with voters hurt      him in the two close elections that he lost in 1986 and 2000.       But most other times, Washington voters realized we were      electing a U.S. senator, not a host for a children's TV show.       Gorton did something few other politicians could--he      learned from that earlier defeat that he had to listen as      well as talk.       He learned to say thank you. He admitted that some of his      votes in his first term were mistakes and he asked voters for      a second chance.       They gave it to him.       That he lost twice shouldn't be a legacy-killer. We forget      how tough it has been for Republicans to win the governor's      office or the two U.S. Senate seats in Washington.       In fact, since 1954 only three Republicans have--Evans,      Gorton and John Spellman.       In that same time period, eight different Democrats have      won those offices--five men and three women.       Gorton overcame that handicap with a strategy that has      always drawn criticism--he ran against Seattle and exploited      the resentments many have for the state's biggest city. He      was accused of using so-called wedge issues that divided the      state.       But that in itself is a Seattle-centric critique. It's OK--     in fact, preferred--to represent Puget Sound to the detriment      of the rest of the state. Doing the opposite, however, is      divisive.       Cantwell won just five of the state's 39 counties. But she      is defined as a unifier while Gorton is a divider.       The campaign is too recent for liberals to view Gorton's      service as anything but a disaster.       But as time passes, perhaps they'll be more willing to give      him his due and allow him to take his place in state      political history with those other giants.                                  ____                   [From the HeraldNet, Dec. 5, 2000]       Our Views--Maria Cantwell Follows a Great Line of Senators       With a history of outstanding U.S. senators, Washington      state is about to embark on what should be a fine new      chapter.       With time, Maria Cantwell ought to become another fine      senator for Washington. Indeed, the likelihood is that the      Democrat from Edmonds will become an effective, high-profile      member of the Senate early on. It certainly helps Cantwell's      visibility that her election appears to have broken the      Republican majority and given Democrats a 50-50 tie for the      next session.       The situation undoubtedly influenced two major networks to      interview Cantwell on their morning news shows Monday. As      Democrats point out, moreover, the election of the former      high-tech executive gives the country its first senator from      the new economy. Even in a Senate that includes a freshman      well enough known to have won election from New York without      using her last name, Cantwell's talents should earn her ample      notice.       While Cantwell is making a promising entry into the Senate,      Washington state certainly will miss the presence of longtime      Sen. Slade Gorton. Although Gorton would be an excellent      choice for a post in a possible Bush cabinet, the state has      lost the clout he carried as a senator with 18 years      seniority.       History will rank Gorton with Sen. Henry M. ``Scoop''      Jackson and Sen. Warren G. Magnuson as an extraordinary      leader in D.C. on behalf of the state. Throughout his career      in the Senate and state government, Gorton has been a leading      force in many major efforts to protect the environment. He      also has been a consistent, passionate advocate for      individuals with problems dealing with bureaucracy. Within      the Senate, Gorton has been a grand force for reasoned      bipartisanship, never afraid to take a strong stand but also      willing to work graciously and effectively with members of      the opposition even at the tensest moments.       Gorton's career was certainly marked by tough fights with      opponents and a willingness to criticize liberals from the      Puget     Sound region. That divisiveness, in fact, may have      contributed to his defeat by Cantwell. But he helped ensure      that the less urban areas of the state weren't forgotten.       To her credit, Cantwell campaigned to become a senator for      the entire state. She has promised, in fact, to visit each of      the state's 39 counties every year. That will be a      challenging but worthwhile task.       Cantwell has talked about the need for action on issues      that relate directly to people's lives, including      prescription drugs and controls on health maintenance      organizations. With her incisive understanding for policy      issues, demonstrated in both the state Legislature and the      U.S. House of Representatives, she could help create answers      to such difficult questions.       Her lack of seniority, though, deprives the state of the      significant influence over appropriations that Gorton      wielded, especially for environmental projects. The state,      and Cantwell, will have to look to Sen. Patty Murray to fill      as much of the gap as possible.       Cantwell returns to politics after making a fortune with a      high-tech company in just five years. As the careers of      Jackson, Magnuson and Gorton have demonstrated, the length of      service is a critical factor in making a great senator.      Cantwell should keep that in mind as she makes what is likely      to be an impressive entrance into the Senate of the United      States.
