 President, tomorrow I will send an amendment to the desk.  Mr. President, my amendment is a sense-of-the-Senate that the Federal Government should live up to its responsibility to educate the children of our women and men in uniform through the impact aid program.  At this point, I would like to ask unanimous consent to add my good friend, the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, as well as Senators Pressler, Akaka, Hutchison, Levin, Bingaman, Pell, Dorgan, Baucus and Kerrey of Nebraska as cosponsors.  Mr. President, you see, this amendment enjoys strong bipartisan support because the impact aid program is a vital component of the education portfolio of 48 States.  It has strong support because Senators on both sides of the aisle know how important this program is to their States and to the country.  More than 40 years ago, the Federal Government established the impact aid program.  Forty years ago--great, forward-thinking legislators recognized that the Federal Government has a responsibility to communities which have been adversely impacted by Federal activities.  Mr. President, this is exactly the underpinning of the legislation we passed earlier in this Congress. The unfunded mandates bill corrected a large-scale shift of costs from the Federal Government to the States and to local communities.  Impact aid is a good program for States--it lives up to the true spirit of local control of education.  Unfortunately, the Federal Government has not been living up to the spirit of the Impact Aid program.  Funding levels for impact aid have been so far below authorized levels that we have unfairly shifted a large portion of funding for Federally connected students to local taxpayers.  The end result is that, now--in many States--this program covers less than half of the costs to educate each student. The Federal Government has just been shifting its responsibility to the States to make up the difference.  Mr. President, when I review the last several years of funding and rescissions, I am outraged with the trend I see developing--we have been abandoning responsibility to our kids by cutting funds for this program.  And, there is no question that the importance of this program has increased over its 40 year history.  Its importance has increased not just because it directly affects over 2 million students in our Nation--but also because of the tight budgets facing our States today.  And, some States--such as my home state of Washington--do not rely upon an income tax for State funding. You see, Mr. President, the loss of property tax revenues makes State and local education funding even more difficult.  Mr. President, let me take a moment to tell you about a school district near Tacoma, WA--it's called Clover Park.  Fort Lewis is in the Clover Park school district. Women and men in uniform are assigned by the Federal Government to serve our Nation there. And, their kids--like all American children--deserve to be educated.  They should not be abandoned because their parents live on Federal property.  Impact Aid makes up 7 percent of Clover Park's budget. In Clover Park, this money goes directly to the school district and is free of bureaucracy.  It provides basic support to the school district whose local school board determines how to use the funds.  Now, Mr. President, if impact aid funds were cut off, school districts would have to increase taxes in the Tacoma community. Or, Clover Park would have to cut teachers and close buildings. Or, the schools would have to double-shift students.  That is wrong. That is a total abdication of the Federal responsibility to our kids.  Of course, we all recognize the budget constraints facing the Federal Government today.  I know tough choices must be made.  However, Mr. President, I believe we can achieve meaningful deficit reduction without passing on this huge unfunded mandate. And, without compromising our responsibility to our schools and our communities.  Mr. President, I want to be sure that adequate resources are put into impact aid. And, this sense-of-the-Senate reconfirms our commitment--on both sides of the aisle--to making that happen.  I urge my colleagues to join our bipartisan coalition and support this amendment.                      children's health insurance
