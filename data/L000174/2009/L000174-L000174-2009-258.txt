President, I am pleased that the Senate today will pass the Antitrust Criminal Penalty Enhancement and Reform Act of 2004 Extension Act, ACPERA. I have long supported vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws. Passage of this legislation ensures that the Department of Justice will retain the tools it needs to prosecute criminal antitrust violations effectively and efficiently.  Since its inception 5 years ago, ACPERA has bolstered the Department of Justice's ability to uncover and prosecute criminal antitrust violations through its leniency program. The act provides incentives for corporations to self-report antitrust violations by limiting criminal liability and the civil damages recoverable to actual damages against a party that comes forward and cooperates with the Department of Justice.  The incentives in this program are critical to the success of the Antitrust Division's criminal antitrust enforcement. The 1-year extension will allow the Department of Justice to continue this successful program while Congress assesses the long-term direction of the Department of Justice's leniency program.
