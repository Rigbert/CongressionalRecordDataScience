Speaker, I appreciate not necessarily the specifics, but at least the assertion that it will be sooner. We believe this is a very important piece of legislation. It is. Obviously, strong views are held on this issue on both sides of the issue. But it is important to an overwhelming majority of Americans, one way or the other, and I would certainly hope, I know both the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Castle) on your side of the aisle, the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette) on our side of the aisle, have both been working very hard on this piece of legislation. We would look forward to it coming to the floor as soon as practical, given the discussions that are ongoing. And I appreciate the Leader's observations. I thank the leader for his information.                          ____________________
