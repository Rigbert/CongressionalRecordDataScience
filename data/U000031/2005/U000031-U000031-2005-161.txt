Speaker, Mr. Dingell and I rise today as the Senior Members of the Michigan Delegation to congratulate and pay tribute to S. Martin Taylor on the occasion of his retirement after 16 years of service as Executive Vice President of DTE Energy in Detroit, Michigan. We have both known this special man through not only his sixteen years at DTE Energy, but also throughout the many years he spent in public service working across and from both sides of the aisle to improve the lives of Michigan's citizens.  Mr. Taylor has shown an exceptional commitment to the people of the state of Michigan. After graduating from Western Michigan University in 1964, he went on to receive his Juris Doctor from the Detroit College of Law in 1967. A lifelong student of both academics and personal interaction, Mr. Taylor received an honorary Doctor of Laws Degree in 2002, from Marygrove College in Detroit, Michigan.  After two years of service in Chicago, Illinois as an attorney at the Container Corporation of America, Mr. Taylor was appointed by then-Governor of Michigan William G. Milliken, a Republican, to serve as the Deputy Director of the Michigan Department of Commerce. Two years later in 1971, Mr. Taylor was appointed by a bipartisan commission representing both labor and management, to serve as the Director of the Michigan Employment Security Commission (MESC), the State's third largest agency. His 13 years of remarkable service at that position led to his appointment by Democratic Governor James Blanchard as Director of the Michigan Department of Labor in 1983. In a remarkable feat of commitment, Mr. Taylor served concurrently as both the Director of the MESC and Michigan's Labor Department for nearly two years.  In 1984, after 15 years of service to the state of Michigan, Martin left his position as Director of Labor in order to serve the people of Detroit as the President of New Detroit Inc., the Nation's first urban coalition developed in response to the civil unrest of 1967. As President, Mr. Taylor acted to facilitate an active and productive dialogue between all social, religious and economic organizations in the Metropolitan Detroit area. Mr. Taylor served with distinction for 5 years at that position.  Finally in 1989, Mr. Taylor was asked to serve as an Executive Vice President of DTE Energy. At this post, Martin was responsible for developing and implementing the company's strategies for human resources, corporate communications, and corporate and government affairs. He worked to enhance the public reputation of DTE Energy and to ensure that its workforce was fully capable of meeting the changing demands and challenges of the energy industry. As a member of the executive committee, Mr. Taylor worked with other senior officers to handle all corporate-wide responsibilities.  Aside from his remarkable service throughout his career, Mr. Taylor also serves on nearly twenty business, civic and community affiliations and boards, and in the past, Martin has been part of over thirty such organizations. In 1996, he was elected to the University of Michigan Board of Regents, where he continues to serve with distinction. He is also the recipient of two commendations of public service by the Michigan Legislature. His civic service provides a great testament to the spirit of commitment and community Mr. Taylor possesses. Martin is truly a model member of the Michigan community and an example for us all.  In addition to his great success in both public and private service, Martin is also fortunate enough to share his life with his wife Ann Diggs Taylor, U.S. District Court Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan. Mr. Taylor also has two step-children, his son, Douglass, and daughter, Carla.  As Martin begins what is surely a deserved retirement, we offer him the best of luck on this long and well-earned journey. Mr. Speaker, we hope you will join with us and our colleagues in the Michigan Delegation to wish Mr. Taylor many years filled with family, friends, and good health and thank him for what he has done for our state.                          ____________________
