 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Roberta Foust, or ``Bobbie'' as she is known to her many friends and readers. With her recent retirement from The Paducah Sun, Bobbie completes a distinguished career as a journalist.  Her byline has long been a familiar one to news readers in the western part of Kentucky. She worked for The Calvert News in Calvert City in the 1960's. In 1972, she began working as a reporter and photographer for The Tribune Courier in Marshall County, in the heart of Kentucky's Western Lakes region. After 5 years, she moved to the rival Marshall County Messenger, where she was responsible for all news content, layout, and design. She returned to The Tribune Courier in a similar capacity in 1979. In 1988, she became the editor of the weekly Herald Ledger in Eddyville, a position she held until the local ownership sold the paper in 1991.  Bobbie then joined the largest newspaper in far Western Kentucky, The Paducah Sun, a daily with a circulation of 31,000. With the Sun, Bobbie served as a general assignment reporter. In this position, she worked in Marshall, Lyon, and other lakes-area counties. Besides the usual broad assortment of news she covered in her day-to-day duties, Bobbie covered certain continuing stories, and developed an in-depth knowledge in these areas that was widely recognized. Among these were the Land Between the Lakes and the role of the Tennessee Valley Authority in LBL and Western Kentucky. During this time, Bobbie earned broad respect in the region she covered, as well as at TVA headquarters in Knoxville and Washington.  I have not only been a regular reader of Bobbie's, but have often been covered in her stories. Over the years, I have had the opportunity to get to know her first-hand, and feel that I am in a uniquely qualified position to comment upon her journalistic legacy. Bobbie has earned a reputation of persistence, thoroughness, and objectivity--the three lodestars of her profession. Always firm in getting the story for her readers, she was unflappably cordial in personal demeanor in the performance of her duties.  Bobbie's retirement plans include the possibility of taking some college course work, and hopefully, the role of occasional contributor to The Paducah Sun. Along with Bobbie's husband, Ray, and children, Donna, Terrie, Jackie, and Dennis, I wish Bobbie an enjoyable and productive retirement. I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing the career of this outstanding Kentuckian.                          ____________________
