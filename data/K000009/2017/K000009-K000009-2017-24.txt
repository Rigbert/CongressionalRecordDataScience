Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill, which basically says companies should be protected, not workers.  Imagine, when a firm is jointly owned and operated by the Chinese or the Mexicans or the El Salvadorans, where workers' rights are never protected.  Worker protections in America have long accounted for the reality that the company who writes the check isn't always the company that controls workplace conditions, but if they share control over workplace conditions, they should be held jointly responsible for violations.  I include in the Record a letter from the United Auto Workers talking about the parts industry.         International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace &            Agricultural Implement Workers of America--UAW,                                 Washington, DC, November 7, 2017.       Dear Representative: On behalf of the more than one million      active and retired members of the International Union, United      Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of      America (UAW), I strongly urge you to oppose H.R. 3441, the      ``Save Local Business Act.'' This ill-conceived bill would      make it more difficult for workers to join together and      collectively bargain to improve working conditions and raise      living standards. This is a bad bill for working people      because it would make it even easier for businesses to      replace full time jobs with precarious temporary employment.       H.R. 3441 overturns long established case law and joint      employer standards found in labor and employment law. It does      this by redefining the term `employer' in a way that would      make it nearly impossible for workers to hold their employers      accountable when their rights are violated.       Disturbingly, businesses and large corporations throughout      our economy have avoided responsibility to their employees by      hiding behind staffing agencies to claim they are not      technically their employer. The net result for working people      has been lower wages and fewer job protections. For example,      within the auto parts manufacturing sector, the National      Employment Law Project (NELP) estimates that temporary      workers earn, on average, 29% less than direct employees of      manufacturers. We have seen how, in the automotive sector,      multinational corporations often hire temporary workers, who      work side by side, doing the same job, for years, with full      time workers and earning significantly less.       H.R. 3441 would also overturn the National Labor Relations      Board's (NLRB) in Browning-Ferris. The Browning-Ferris      decision was good for working families because it established      that workers could negotiate with their true employer under      fact specific circumstances. In that case, a subcontractor      for Browning-Ferris Industries (BFI), Leadpoint, was unable      to negotiate several basic employment terms without      permission from BFI. The NLRB sensibly found that BFI must be      at the bargaining table along with its subcontractor      Leadpoint. Under the terms of this bill, that would not be      the case when similar disputes arise in the future.       Economic inequality and a shortage of good paying jobs has      hurt working people and our economy for decades.      Unfortunately, H.R. 3441 would make a bad situation worse.      Congress should reject this bill and instead work to create      more jobs you can sustain a family on.           Sincerely,                                                      Josh Nassar,                                             Legislative Director.
