Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I, too, want to thank my friends and colleagues on the other side, the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Michaud) and, of course, our distinguished chairman of the subcommittee who spoke earlier, and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans), the ranking member, just thank them for their good work on this, and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Gerlach), of course the prime sponsor.  I also want to thank Senator Specter who is the chairman of the Senate Veterans Committee with whom we worked on all of these issues, but he got this back very, very quickly in a way that actually improved it. So I want to thank him for that, and Senator Graham.
