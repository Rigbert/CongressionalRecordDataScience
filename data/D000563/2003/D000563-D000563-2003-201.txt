 million members of the National Guard and Reserve, 120,000, or 10 percent, are Federal employees; 14,000 Federal employees are currently mobilized and serving on active duty. We ask with this amendment that the Federal Government treat its employees the way State after State after State has decided to treat them. If they are activated, we will make up the difference in their lost pay, the difference between their pay as activated members of the military and what they would have earned with the Federal Government.  We know we are asking the Guard and Reserve to accept greater and longer responsibilities, with more hardship for their families. I would like to make it clear with a record vote this morning that we want the Federal Government to serve as an example for governments across America to stand behind the men and women in uniform, to make up their difference in pay, stand by their families, as they risk their lives to serve our country.  I urge my colleagues to give this a strong, overwhelming vote so the conference will stand behind it and this will become the law of the land.
