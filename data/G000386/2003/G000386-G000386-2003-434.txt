 President, I yield myself such time as I might consume.  I would like to refer to the capital gains provisions of the compromise bill. I discussed last night the benefits of seeing capital gains reduced to 15 percent, and 5 percent for low-income families and individuals. But I also want to emphasize the simplification that we are bringing to the capital gains rates. While we still have the 1-year division between short-term and long-term capital gains, we have eliminated the 5-year holding period and the 18-percent rate.  It is a small but very important step in actually eliminating lots of lines and lots of calculations that taxpayers face in their annual returns.
