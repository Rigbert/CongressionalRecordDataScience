Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 3287, the Crawford National Fish Hatchery Conveyance Act, introduced by our colleague from Nebraska, Bill Barrett.  This measure is somewhat different from other fish hatchery transfer bills in that it will convey about 6 acres of Federal lands not to the State, but to the city of Crawford, NE.  For nearly 62 years, this hatchery was used by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Nebraska State Game and Park Commission to produce millions of bluegill, channel catfish, largemouth bass, various species of trout, and their eggs.  Unfortunately, in 1991, the Crawford National Fish Hatchery was severely damaged from flooding of the White River. The facilities were closed, no repairs were made, the buildings have not been maintained, and there is no likelihood that either the Federal or the State Government will reopen this hatchery in the future.  Furthermore, the hatchery is located in the middle of the city park. While the local community has spent a substantial amount of money to rebuild its park facilities, these efforts have been undermined by this unwanted, rapidly deteriorating, and increasingly dangerous fish hatchery.  H.R. 3287 will convey the hatchery property to the city of Crawford, which has made a commitment to restore and use certain buildings for various recreational activities. In addition, the bill contains the standard reversionary clause that requires the city of Crawford to return this property to the Federal Government, if it is used for anything other than the authorized purposes.  I urge an ``aye'' vote on this legislation and compliment Bill Barrett for his outstanding leadership in this matter.
