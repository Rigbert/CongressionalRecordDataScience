He entered into the Record an opinion of another doctor which said the woman who faced that crisis pregnancy should have done it differently. I don't know if the Senator from Pennsylvania is aware of the fact that she not only had the counsel of her own obstetrician/gynecologist, but she had the counsel of her husband who was a practicing physician. She was relying on her husband's medical knowledge and the advice of her obstetrician/gynecologist. The Senator from Pennsylvania has found another doctor who disagrees. And he says that is why we should overrule her personal doctor and her personal obstetrician in this case; that we should make the decision here; that Senators and politicians should be making the decisions about what was the right information for her in that circumstance.  Is there something wrong with that picture? I think there is. We should leave the decisions in a crisis pregnancy, in a case where literally disaster occurs to the family, to the woman and her doctor, to her family, and to her God. For us to step in and say we are going to make medical decisions goes way too far.  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, representing 45,000 OB/GYNs, agrees:       The intervention of legislative bodies in the medical      decisionmaking is inappropriate, ill-advised, and dangerous.  I yield the floor.
