Speaker, if the gentleman will continue to yield, I agree that would have been easier; and, furthermore, I believe, had there been agreement and a majority for the House-passed budget numbers, we could have passed our bills.  It seems to me, Mr. Speaker, the problem is that the votes are not there to sustain the budget the House passed and put forward, and that really is the nub of the problem, that we passed a budget that was not realistic and that, therefore, we and the Committee on Appropriations are unable to pass bills which can garner the requisite votes to pass. And I sympathize with the gentleman's challenge.
