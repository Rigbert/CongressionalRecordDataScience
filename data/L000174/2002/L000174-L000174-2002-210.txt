President, I rise today to introduce the Judicial Improvements Act of 2002, a bipartisan bill that will amend judicial discipline procedures to ensure fair consideration of judicial misconduct complaints. I am pleased to have Senator Thompson as a cosponsor of this legislation, and I look forward to moving this bill through the Senate.  While I am introducing legislation addressing judicial misconduct, I wantto be clear that the vast majority of judges serve honorably. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I take a special responsibility for evaluating nominees to ensure they are fit to serve. Despite the scrutiny judicial nominees undergo, however, we have faced situations when judges have acted improperly. Some have even been convicted of criminal offenses. In the late 1980s, the Senate convicted three Federal judges who were impeached by the House. This bill does not alter the Congress' responsibility to impeach and convict judges where necessary, but it does refine the process--originally created by Congress in the Judicial Councils Reform and Judicial Conduct and Disability Act of 1980, by which aggrieved citizens can bring complaints that can be evaluated through an impartial review.  Under the framework codified by this bill, a person with a complaint about a judge's conduct may file a written complaint with the clerk of the court of appeals for the judge's circuit. The chief judge must review the complaint and either dismiss it, if it meets certain narrow criteria, or refer it to a panel of judges from the circuit. The judge who is the subject of the complaint retains the right to present evidence and argue before the panel. The circuit council may certify the judge's misconduct of disability and request that the judge voluntarily retire, but may not order removal from office. A complainant or judge aggrieved by an action of a judicial council can petition the Judicial Conference for review. And if a complaint is dismissed, the judge who was its subject may be reimbursed for reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred during the investigation.  If a judicial council determines that an Article III judge has acted in a way that might constitute grounds of impeachment, it must certify such determination to the Judicial Conference, which can in turn refer that determination to the House of Representatives.  With very limited exceptions, all matters related to judicial misconduct investigations must be confidential and not disclosed by any person in any proceeding. This provision protects judges who are accused falsely of wrongdoing while also ensuring confidentiality for those with legitimate complaints.  The bill also forbids judges who have been convicted of a State or Federal felony and have exhausted all available means for direct review of that conviction from hearing or deciding cases or accruing credit toward retirement benefits, unless the judicial council of the circuit determines otherwise. This measure, like many of the measures in this legislation, was recommended in 1993 by the nonpartisan National Commission on Judicial Discipline and Removal.  Some may question whether this bill raises separation of powers concerns. It does not. This bill is narrowly tailored, as was the 1980 law that this bill amends, to ensure that Congress gives the judiciary the powers it needs to regulate itself while preserving its constitutional role in the impeachment process. The general scheme we established in 1980 has worked well, and has conformed with our constitutional principles. This bill simply seeks to improve that system where it has shown to be lacking. To give one example, experts in this area have suggested that many litigants and interested parties are unaware of the existence of these procedures--to rectify that, we create a separate chapter within title 28 of the U.S. Code to promote knowledge and use of these procedures. It also clarifies the authority of the chief judge of a circuit and the standard by which a compliant can be dismissed as frivolous, and makes explicit that complaints can be referred to a five-member panel for examination.  Highly similar legislation has already been reported from the House Judiciary Committee with strong bipartisan support. I hope that my colleagues in the Senate review and support this bill, and that we can make it law this year.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 2713       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

In      determining what action to take, the chief judge may conduct      a limited inquiry for the purpose of determining--       ``(1) whether appropriate corrective action has been or can      be taken without the necessity for a formal investigation;      and       ``(2) whether the facts stated in the complaint are either      plainly untrue or are incapable of being established through      investigation.     For this purpose, the chief judge may request the judge whose      conduct is complained of to file a written response to the      complaint. Such response shall not be made available to the      complainant unless authorized by the judge filing the      response. The chief judge or his or her designee may also      communicate orally or in writing with the complainant, the      judge whose conduct is complained of, and any other person      who may have knowledge of the matter, and may review any      transcripts or other relevant documents. The chief judge      shall not undertake to make findings of fact about any matter      that is reasonably in dispute.       ``(b) Action by Chief Judge Following Review.--After      expeditiously reviewing a complaint under subsection (a), the      chief judge, by written order stating his or her reasons,      may--       ``(1) dismiss the complaint--       ``(A) if the chief judge finds the complaint to be--       ``(i) not in conformity with section 351(a);       ``(ii) directly related to the merits of a decision or      procedural ruling; or       ``(iii) frivolous, lacking sufficient evidence to raise an      inference that misconduct has occurred, or containing      allegations which are incapable of being established through      investigation; or       ``(B) when a limited inquiry conducted under subsection (a)      demonstrates that the allegations in the complaint lack any      factual foundation or are conclusively refuted by objective      evidence; or       ``(2) conclude the proceeding if the chief judge finds that      appropriate corrective action has been taken or that action      on the complaint is no longer necessary because of      intervening events.
