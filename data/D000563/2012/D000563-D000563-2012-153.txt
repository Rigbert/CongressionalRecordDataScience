President, today is November 13. I think what strikes me about this date is it has only been 7 days since the election. It seems like a lot longer. Maybe it is because the election campaign itself felt so long. But it has been 7 days since the American people went out and voted.  I have to say this: It was not just because of the victory of the President which was important to many of us, but it was quite a validation of this country and this democracy that millions of Americans made the personal sacrifice, took the time, and went to the polling places and actually cast a vote. When it was all over, thank the Lord, it was decisive. The President won a majority of the popular vote as well as a strong majority of electoral votes. The outcome was not in suspense or in doubt when it was all over. That was good for the process, it was good for our country, and, quite frankly, it is time for us to move forward.  During the course of the campaign, I was actively working in my State of Illinois, around the Midwest, on behalf of the President. I was at one of these spin rooms, which is kind of hard to describe. You will not find it in the Constitution. It is hard to describe. After the debates there was this scrum of politicians and spokesmen who stood together under little signs with their names on them waiting for the press to come up to them and say: What did you see? What do you think?  I was in one of those. I can't remember where it was. I think it might have been New York at Hofstra after one of the Presidential debates. One of the reporters said to me: So, Mr. Durbin, I know you are here supporting President Obama. What are you going to doif Governor Romney wins and becomes President?  I said: Well, I am going to respect him, do everything I can to work with him to solve the problems of this country.  Do you know what he said? He said: I am going to hold you to that. Well, he should. That is the responsibility we all have regardless of party, to work with the President to solve our Nation's problems.  Now, there were some who said 4 years ago that when they viewed the new President, President Obama, their goal was to make sure, above all, that he was a one-term President. That was an unfortunate statement because it suggested that solving problems and dealing with our challenges was secondary to a political victory. I hope that in the second term the President can turn to both sides of the aisle in Congress and find support for solving our Nation's problems. They are many.  The first one is this fiscal cliff which Americans are hearing more and more about. On December 31 of this year laws will expire and things are going to happen. What will happen is taxes will go up across the board, not just on the wealthy but on everyone. There will be cutbacks in unemployment compensation, cutbacks in the payroll tax, 2-percent cuts. There will be a lot of different changes that affect a lot of people. We are going to see automatic cuts in spending, sequestration as we call it, both on the defense side and nondefense side.  Many people have said: Well, who dreamed this up? And the honest answer is all of us in Congress, Democrats and Republicans, together with the President created this so-called fiscal cliff, and we voted for it. The Republican leader of the Senate was here a few minutes ago. He voted in favor of it. I did too.  The idea was to have a December 31 deadline that was so imposing and so threatening that we would do something to avoid it. We created a supercommittee to reduce the deficit, with equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans, and said: Find a way out of this deficit mess so we can avoid this cliff.  They could not. They were unable to reach an agreement. So now this December 31 deadline is looming. It is one that ought to sharpen our senses and our attention on solving the problems that face this country. They are substantial.  First, we need to get out of this recession. We are moving forward but slowly. We need to make sure that whatever we do in Congress it moves us in the direction of creating more jobs and strengthening business and making us more competitive in the 21st-century economy.  But secondly, as important, we need to deal with the deficit, a deficit which requires us to borrow 40 cents for every dollar we spend in Washington. That is unsustainable. I say that as a Democrat. Republicans say it as well. We have got to balance the two, keep the economy moving forward and yet make a serious commitment to deficit reduction.  I was on the Bowles-Simpson Presidential commission which President Obama created. There were 18 of us. Eleven of us voted for the commission report, a bipartisan report, and I still believe that it contains the basic ingredients for finding our way through this challenge. I hope we could have support from the other side of the aisle.  I listened carefully to the speech just given by the Senator from Kentucky, and he said repeatedly that the election is behind us, we need to work together. That is exactly the right thing to say. It means we have to ask the Republican side that they join us in finding revenue. We know we need more in tax revenue to deal with this deficit. The President has proposed that those making over $250,000 a year pay a little more. I don't think that is unreasonable. Those who have been blessed with success and comfort in life and doubly blessed by being part of this great Nation should be wanting to pay back a little to help us get through this economic challenge, and I think they will. I genuinely think they will. I also believe those who are in the middle-income categories, working families, need to be spared a tax increase. Many of them are struggling paycheck to paycheck. It isn't an easy economy in which to raise a child, put a child through college or keep your home or make plans for the future. We need to give those working families a helping hand to make sure they don't face a tax rise.  The President said the other day that we have a bill pending before the House that would spare those families making $250,000 or less a year from seeing a tax increase, and he asked the House to pass it. I hope they will. That means we can focus on taxes only for those in higher income categories. The Senator from Kentucky said, well, it doesn't raise that much money. I beg to differ. If we impose a tax on those making over $250,000 a year, and if we go back pre-Bush tax cuts, it raises $800 billion over 10 years. That is not insubstantial. It is an important sum that we need to have to move toward a budget that is closer to being in balance. We have to include it. We need to look at entitlement programs in an honest fashion. We need to make sure that at the end of the day the Social Security system is there for generations to come, and Medicare, which is so important to 40 or 50 million Americans, will be there for many years to come as well. That is part of our responsibility.  I welcome the statement by the Senator from Kentucky. I take him at his word that he is willing to work with the President. He has called on the President to lead, and that is only right; the President is the leader of our Nation.  I might also add that we need leadership in Congress as well, Democrats and Republicans willing to sit down at a table and reasonably work out our differences. It is not easy, but we can do it and we should do it.                           Veterans Day 2012
