 It is our hope we will be able to consider any nominations available for Senate action. The nomination of Samuel Bodman was reported earlier today by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. We hope that nomination can be cleared for action on Monday. We have no requests for a rollcall vote on the Bodman nomination. Therefore, rollcall votes are not anticipated during Monday's session.  Also, earlier today, Chairman Specter and the Judiciary Committee reported out the nomination of Alberto Gonzales to be Attorney General. We will consider that nomination, as well, next week.                          ____________________[Page S614]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
