 President, I voted for the balanced budget amendment last year. I also voted for the Reid amendment to exempt Social Security, take it off budget, last year. I want to state for the Record--and it is my intention--that I want to vote for a balanced budget amendment.  There are two reasons I want to vote for a balanced budget amendment. The first is my own life experience. The year I was born, 61 years ago, the entire Federal debt amounted to just $25 billion. When my daughter was born, the entire Federal debt amounted to about $225 billion. And 2 years ago, when my granddaughter, Eileen, was born, the entire Federal debt was 150 times greater than when I was born; it was nearly $4 trillion. My life experience shows me that, with business as usual, the Congress is not going to be able to balance a budget that, in 61 years, has gone from $25 billion to $4 trillion in debt.  So, in a nutshell, I want to support a strong balanced budget amendment. But I want to support the right balanced budget amendment.  In my first 2 years as U.S. Senator, I have had the opportunity to observe the standard operating procedure of the Senate--the budget, authorization, and appropriations processes--and I have become convinced that a balanced budget amendment is in order. The American people are sitting on a debt time bomb. It jeopardizes the economic security of my daughter, my granddaughter, and even generations to come, because if it continues to be business as usual, the Nation's path is one toward bankruptcy and that, quite frankly, is not acceptable.  I have listened to a lot of arguments about why we should not require a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. In theory, certain of these have a great deal of merit. But historical and present day practices often demonstrate the wide variation between theory and practice when it comes to dealing with the Federal budget.  In theory, the Government might run deficits in times of recession to stimulate the economy, or in war simply to pay its bills, and surpluses in times of prosperity because revenue increases and unemployment decreases. In fact, though, that has not happened. In the last 35 years, the Federal Government has balanced its budget exactly twice--once in 1960, a surplus of $300 million, and again in 1969, a surplus of $3.2 billion.  In the last quarter of a century, the Federal Government has run up this $4 trillion in debt without once balancing the budget. And during this time, the Nation has experienced war and peace and economic booms and recessions. Yet, never was this Government able to balance the Federal budget, let alone run a surplus.  As mayor of San Francisco, I balanced nine budgets, and I know it is tough to do so. I support this amendment, and I support a line-item veto, because I know that failing to balance the budget is a choice that this Nation can no longer afford, for the reasons so stated.  Let us talk for a moment about two charts which, when I came here, convinced me--and I regret that these are so small; we thought we had them enlarged, but we do not. These two charts, I think, are very instructive. If you can see them, Mr. President, in 1969--these are Federal outlay charts--military spending consumed 45 percent of our Federal outlays. In 1994, about 19 percent of our Federal outlays were military. So military spending has gone from almost one-half to just slightly under a quarter.   [[Page S1901]] In 1969, entitlements--Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and AFDC--consumed about 27 percent of Federal outlays.  In 1994, they consumed almost 50 percent of Federal outlays. There is the rub. In 1969, interest on our debt consumed slightly less than 7 percent. In 1994, interest on the debt had doubled to nearly 14 percent of total outlays.  What is left? Discretionary spending--education, health, environment, Commerce, Interior, all those departments--in 1969 consumed 21 percent of Federal outlays. In 1994, 18 percent; actually down. Discretionary spending has gone down, military spending has gone down dramatically.  What has gone up? Interest on the debt and entitlements. And there is the rub. There is the answer I believe to the right to know. That is the road that lies before us. If we really want to make the budget balanced, those are the hard choices: What to do about interest on the debt--which today net interest consumes 40 percent of every person's tax dollar--and how do we control entitlements, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and so on?  The Federal Government now spends $226 billion just on interest on its nearly $5 trillion debt. Our interest payments alone are $59 billion greater than the projected deficit of $176 billion for the year 1995. This means that if we did not have to service the debt, there would be no deficit this year. If we did not have to service our debt, there would be no deficit. As a matter of fact, there would be a small budget surplus. That is the irony of the problem that we have.  So if current policy continues, the CBO estimates that net interest payments will reach $387 billion by the year 2004, or roughly 58 percent of the amount that is expected to be spent on all discretionary programs, $669 billion will go by the year 2004 just to pay for interest on the debt. That is not for Commerce. That is not for Interior. That is not for an education program. That is not for a health program. That will not purchase a tank or an aircraft carrier or a battleship. It will be just paper to service the debt.  Today, every dollar in personal income taxes collected west of the Mississippi is used to pay for nothing more than interest. And that is the sad story, because the interest is growing and we need to stop it.  So what has 35 years of accumulated deficits meant on our committee? According to a study by the New York Federal Reserve Board, the low national savings rate, now under 3 percent--and it is the lowest of any major industrialized power--is mostly attributable to large Federal deficits. And it has resulted in a net loss of 5 percent of national income during the 1980's. That impacts interest rates, it impacts jobs, it impacts the ability to buy a home, a car, to afford an education. It impacts the job base. It impacts everything we do every day in our life.  And as it gets worse, I think what the Senator from Maine was saying is it impacts our children's destinies and our grandchildren's destinies as well.  So for all of these reasons--and I want my chairman on the Judiciary Committee to understand this--I want to vote for a balanced budget amendment because I do not believe we can make the hard choices without it. And as I have said, they are all in that 50 percent--Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, AFDC--and then that 15 percent which is interest on the debt for the most part.  Now, I do not think Congress should push through just any amendment, no matter what. It has to be an amendment which balances the budget wisely and honestly.  And that is the rub for me. This is where we come to Social Security. Let me be frank. I do not want to speak in detail because we will go into this later.  But because of a statement I made yesterday indicating my position--and I am particularly delighted that my chairman is on the floor so that he can hear this. I consider the greatest flaw in the amendment that we have before us is the fact that it places moneys placed in reserve through the FICA tax to pay for retirements in the future. It places those revenues on budget. And I believe that that is not an honest way to balance the budget.  I believe that this puts Social Security essentially on budget. It reverses congressional action and it undermines the integrity of the Social Security system.  Now between its creation in 1935 and 1969, Social Security was always off budget. Then in an attempt to cover the cost of the Vietnam war and to mask the growing deficit, Social Security was put on budget by this Congress. This was a misuse of the Social Security trust fund.  In 1990, 2 years before I came to this place, the Congress saw that and they put an end to it. They declared as follows:       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts      and disbursements of the Federal Old Age and Survivors      Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance      Trust Fund shall not be counted as new budget authority,      outlays, receipts, or deficit or surplus for purpose of:       (1) the budget of the United States Government as submitted      by the President,       (2) the congressional budget, or       (3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act      of 1985.  In this body, that vote was 98 to 2. So clearly, Members said we must not use Social Security revenues held in trust for retirement to balance the budget. And, boom, the right thing was done and it was taken off budget.  What this amendment does is put it back on budget again.  This would clearly include Social Security. It would overturn both the historical treatment of Social Security and Congress' recent decision to affirm the off-budget status of Social Security. Worse, it would allow the misuse of Social Security funds to continue.  The important point is, Congress has already debated this. They have taken it off budget. It is not a loophole. This amendment is not meant to be an escape hatch.  I know that there is an amendment at the desk called S. 290. I reviewed that amendment. That amendment is flawed because that amendment deals with benefits. It does not deal with the moneys that are taken from the FICA tax paid by employees and employers and held in trust for retirees.  Now, even without this balanced budget amendment, just for one short moment let us look at what happens with Social Security now off budget.  Here we are today in 1995. Social Security is generating surpluses.  As a matter of fact, Social Security will generate these surpluses, up to the year 2002. In 1995, $69 billion; 1996, $142 billion. It climbs and it climbs. In 1999, it is $394 billion. It goes up to $705 billion of surpluses from the FICA tax held in trust to pay retirements for the baby boomer generation that is now, alas, beginning to retire.  What happens? What happens is this: There is $3 trillion by the year 2015 in revenue surpluses. Then they plunge. They go down to the year 2030, $700 billion negative. Negative. Now, here is the rub with this amendment. It takes all of these revenues and it puts them on budget. So these revenues are used to balance the budget. The way to avoid $705 billion in 2002 when this becomes relevant is to create a surplus of $705 billion. Nobody here believes we will be able to create a surplus of $705 billion to protect Social Security.  So what is the answer? The answer is, in an honest amendment, take it off budget. Do not allow those revenues to be used.  Now, I would like to have printed in the Record a letter I received today from Martha McSteen, the president of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. She says:       I am writing with regard to S. 290, introduced recently by      Senators Kempthorne, Dole, Thompson and Inhofe. The fact that      the sponsors of S. 290 believe that it is necessary to take      action to protect Social Security under a balanced budget      amendment is, in my view, proof that it is imperative that      the Senate adopt your amendment to exclude Social Security      from the balanced budget amendment.  The pending balanced budget amendment reverses the 1990 law removing Social Security from a consolidated budget and put Social Security back on budget as part of the Constitution. This represents a serious problem for Social Security which cannot be addressed by S. 290 or any statutory measure. Sponsors of S. 290 cannot bind future Congresses to their legislation or, for that matter, ensure that this Congress will not modify or overturn this legislation while Social Security [[Page S1902]] would remain on budget as part of the Constitution.  I also note that while S. 290 attempts to prohibit Congress from increasing Social Security revenues or reducing benefits to balance the budget, it will allow Congress to continue using the surplus in the Social Security trust fund to conceal the deficit. This only confirms our understanding that the proponents of the balanced budget amendment intend to continue this budgetary charade, thereby avoiding balancing the budget well into the next century.  I ask unanimous consent that the letter in its entirety be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                    National Committee to Preserve                                 Social Security and Medicare,                                 Washington, DC, February 1, 1995.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing with regard to S. 290,      introduced recently by Senators Kempthorne, Dole, Thompson      and Inhofe. The fact that the sponsors of S. 290 believe that      it is necessary to take action to protect Social Security      under a balanced budget amendment is, in my view, proof that      it is imperative that the Senate adopt your amendment to      exclude Social Security from the balanced budget amendment.       The pending balanced budget amendment reverses the 1990 law      removing Social Security from a consolidated budget and puts      Social Security back on budget as part of the Constitution.      This presents serious problems for Social Security which      cannot be addressed by S. 290 or any statutory measure. The      sponsors of S. 290 cannot bind future Congresses to their      legislation, or for that matter ensure that this Congress      will not modify or overturn this legislation while Social      Security would remain on budget as part of the Constitution.      I also note that while S. 290 attempts to prohibit Congress      from increasing Social Security revenues or reducing benefits      to balance the budget, it will allow Congress to continue      using the surplus in the Social Security trust funds to      conceal the deficit. This only confirms our understanding      that the proponents of the balanced budget amendment intend      to continue this budgetary charade thereby avoiding balancing      the budget until well into the next century.       The nearly six million members and supporters of the      National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare      strongly oppose this practice of using the surplus generated      by the Social Security payroll tax to fund deficit reduction      or mask the true size of the general fund deficit.       Let's not forget that the continued borrowing from the      Social Security trust funds will only create huge debts for      the next generation which will be forced to redeem the bonds      through massive tax increases.       The only way for proponents of the balanced budget      amendment to live up to the many promises not to harm or      undermine Social Security is to explicitly exclude it from      the text of S.J. Res. 1.           Sincerely,                                                Martha A. McSteen,                                                        President.
