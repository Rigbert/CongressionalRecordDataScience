 President, last month when we were considering legislation to extend the Generalized System of Preferences [GSP], I raised an issue involving an unfair trade practice that has been of great concern to U.S. growers and processors of soybeans. I described a tax policy employed by certain countries, including some who are major beneficiaries of the GSP program, to give their processors and exporters of agricultural products an unfair competitive advantage in world markets. This policy is used particularly to benefit foreign soybean meal and oil processors and exporters.  This tax policy, known as a differential export tax scheme [DET], in effect operates as an indirect subsidy for exports of soybean meal and oil, permitting oilseed processors in those countries to underprice their competitors and obtain greater market shares for these products. As a consequence, the United States share of the world export market for soybean products has declined significantly, while the countries that engage in these trade-distorting practices, such as Brazil and Argentina, continue to experience tremendous export growth in these same products. Moreover, these tax schemes have had the effect of creating artificial downward pressure on world price levels for these products, which has severely reduced U.S. soybean industry revenues.  In my statement last month, I cited the tax structure utilized by the State of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil as a particularly egregious case in point. At that time, I noted the commitment of the Brazilian Federal Government to reforming that system. I am pleased to report that earlier this month, the Government of Brazil enacted reform legislation that eliminates these taxes on exports of raw materials and semi-manufactured goods. I want to publicly congratulate the Government of Brazil for this major accomplishment. I hope the example of leadership that Brazil has set in taking this important step will encourage other countries that continue to utilize these tax schemes to take similar steps toward free and fair trade. I will continue to carefully monitor these developments and, as I noted in my previous statement, I am prepared to consider appropriate measures to encourage further progress in this regard.                          ____________________
