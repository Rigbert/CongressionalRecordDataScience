 President.  Mr. President, we have had some discussion this morning, we will have some more discussions this afternoon, and some discussion tomorrow as well, on a constitutional amendment to protect the flag.  Nothing symbolizes what we might call our national spirit like the flag. In times of crisis it inspires us to do more. In times of tranquility it moves us to do better. And, at all times it unifies us in the face of our diversity and of our difference.  There are those who believe that we should not, under any circumstances, and no matter how it is worded, write an amendment into the Constitution to protect the flag because they believe there is no way to do that without damaging an even more cherished right, our right to say whatever we wish to say when we wish to say it without the Government acting as a censor, without the Government choosing among our words, which are appropriate and which are not.  I understand their view and I respect it. I believe, as strongly as I believe anything about this debate, that those against the amendment in question are no less patriotic, no more un-American, no less American, no better, no worse than those who share the view that the amendment in question is an appropriate way to protect the flag, which really means to speak to our national spirit and consensus that exists in America about what we stand for. The so-called culture norms people often speak to.  I respect their motives and I respect their views. But they are not mine. Although it is arguably not necessary to enshrine in the Constitution a way of protecting the flag, I believe that written properly, I believe stated properly, it can in fact legitimately be placed in the Constitution without doing damage to any of the other elements of our Constitution. But I should say up front that the amendment in question, in my view, does not do that. I say this as one who has made it his business here on the floor, along with my friend from Vermont, whom I see on the floor, and others, of sometimes being out of step in the minds of many people in terms of protecting the civil liberties of persons in this country to say what they wish to say, to publish what we do not wish them to publish, and to take actions we find reprehensible. But the Senator from Vermont, myself, and others believe they are guaranteed under the first amendment.  The first amendment does not say that you can only say things which reflect insight. The first amendment does not say you have to be bright. The first amendment does not say you have to be right. All the first amendment says is that you can say what you wish to say in relation to speech, and the Government cannot censor what you say no matter how, with notable exceptions, how much we do not like what is being said.  But I believe that the flag stands alone, and that is a legitimate way to protect our flag as the singular and unifying symbol of a diverse people in need--I would add in urgent need sometimes--of common ground. America is the most extraordinary nation on Earth.  I realize those who are here in the galleries who may be from other countries, or those who listen to this on CNN, or C-SPAN--if it is carried--will say, ``Isn't that a typical American assertion, a chauvinistic assertion?'' ``We are the most extraordinary nation on Earth.'' We are extraordinary in the sense not that we are better as individuals, not that we are smarter, not that we are wiser, more generous, or less venal than other people, but the genius of America is the American system, a system that takes into account our significant diversity which in other countries--that diversity I am referring to--and in other systems creates great strife.  We take that diversity, which in other countries creates strife, and we have turned it into strength. That is not very easy to do. People often fear diversity. The fact that we are black and white does not automatically generate fellowship and harmony. The fact that we are Christian, Jew, and Moslem does not send us running into one another's embrace to herald our differences. The fact of the matter is that people fear that which is different. It is a human condition.  Our diversity naturally pushes us apart, not together. But what holds us together as a nation, Mr. President, is not a common language, although I think that is necessary; not a common world view, which I do not think is necessary. What holds us together is a common commitment to a system of government, a covenant of goodwill, of tolerance, of equality, and freedom, that is enshrined in the Constitution. And the flag stands as the single most important symbol of that covenant. It is the story of all we have been and the symbol of what we wish to become.  To me, the flag is much more than the sum of the stars and the stripes. It sounds corny to say, and to listen to it sometimes, but it is also idealistic. I believe that it is important even more now than then for all Americans to feel like a family. Like all families we have our problems. We squabble with each other. We misunderstood each other. And we hurt each other in countless ways. But at the end of the day we still need to feel like a family under one roof bound together by shaped and shared values, and a shared sense of respect and tolerance.  It is the flag that symbolizes those shared values and which reminds us of how the shared covenant of respect and tolerance has to be maintained. It is the flag under which we as a diverse and sometimes divisive community can come together as one. And it is the flag that flies high and proud over our Nation's home.  But to say that the flag is worth protecting does not end our conversation. It is only, in my view, where we start, for we must ask how the flag should be protected. As we look to protect the flag, we must not lose sight of the first amendment and its guiding principles for, although the flag may stand alone, it should not and it cannot stand above our most cherished freedom of speech.  Here is what I mean. At heart of the first amendment lies a very basic notion; that is, the Government cannot muzzle a speaker because it dislikes what he or she says, or discriminate between your speech and mine because it agrees with me but disagrees with you. That sort of viewpoint discrimination is most importantly what the first amendment forbids.  As the Supreme Court has said, and I quote:       Above all else, the first amendment means that government      has no tolerance to restrict expression because of its      message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content. The      essence of forbidden censorship is content control.  Just last term, the Supreme Court forcefully reiterated its intolerance for viewpoint discrimination in the majority opinion of Rosenberger versus the University of Virginia. Justices Rehnquist, Scalia, Thomas, Kennedy, and O'Connor--Rehnquist, Scalia, and Thomas not accused of being a liberal triumvirate--said:       In the realm of private speech or expression, government      regulation may not favor one speaker over another. When the      government targets particular views taken by speakers on a      subject, the violation of the first amendment is all the more      blatant.  The Government can tell us we may not blast our opinions over a loudspeaker at 3 a.m. in the morning. It can tell us that we cannot distribute obscenity and that we cannot spread libelous statements about one another. But it cannot apply different rules based upon the viewpoint of the broadcast, the obscenity, or the libel. It cannot say you cannot engage in that obscenity because of the viewpoint of the expression, you cannot broadcast something because of the viewpoint you are expressing, or you cannot say that about another person because of the viewpoint that you are expressing. It cannot apply different rules to Democrats and Republican, hippies and yuppies, rich and poor, black and white, or any other division in this country.  It was on this point to protect the flag, while not doing violence to the core first amendment principle of viewpoint neutrality, that I wrote the Flag Protection Act of 1988. That act aimed to safeguard the physical integrity of the flag across the board by making it a Federal crime to mutilate, deface, physically defile, burn, maintain on the floor, or ground, or trample upon the American flag. It passed the Senate, was signed by the President, and it became law.  The statute focused solely on the exclusivity of the conduct of the actor, regardless of any idea the actor might have been trying to convey, regardless of whether he meant to cast contempt on the flag, regardless of whether anyone was offended by his actions.  The statute was written that way because, in my view and in the view of other of constitutional scholars, the Government's interest in preserving the flag is the same regardless of the particular idea that may have motivated any particular person to burn or mutilate the flag. Our interest in the flag is in the flag itself as the symbol of what we know in our hearts to be precious and rare and which flies high and proud over this place we call home, a precious and rare symbol of this Nation.  The flag's unique place in our national life means that we should preserve it against all manner of destruction. It does not matter whether the flag burner means to protest a war, or praise a war, or start a barbecue. It is the flag that is the treasured symbol--not the obnoxious speech nor the positive speech that accompanies the burning of the flag--that must be protected.  We are here today deciding whether to add the 28th amendment to the Constitution, with a thought, I believe, that the flag is worthy of constitutional protection. Although I believe it is worthy of constitutional protection, I nevertheless must oppose the constitutional amendment that is before us now. I oppose it because, in my view, it puts the flag on a collision course with the Bill of Rights.  Again, the purpose of these amendments is to protect the flag as if we are going to protect a tombstone, as if we are going to protect the national eagle, as if we are going to protect it as the most precious of those symbols. It does not matter to me whether someone comes with a sledgehammer and defiles a tombstone of a war hero by saying, ``I do this because I do not think this slate of granite warrants being on top of your sacred body.'' I do not care whether they do it when they smash it because they say, ``I do this because I protest you and the war that you fought in,'' and so on. The end result is the tombstone is destroyed.  That is the story I want to get across about the flag. If it is the flag we wish to protect and not amend the first amendment, not make choices among the types of speech we can engage in, then let us protect the flag--nothing else. As I said, I do not care whether someone takes that flag and lights the flag and burns it in this Chamber offering it up as a sacred symbol for all who died in the name of this country or grabbed it and burned it because they are protesting the grotesque policy of the United States on such and such. The end result is the national symbol is burned. And when we go beyond protecting merely the symbol, we go to choosing, making choices among the types of speech we will allow Americans to engage in.  I oppose the amendment because it puts the flag on a collision course with the Bill of Rights. Let me expand on that. The proposed amendment gives the Congress and the 50 States the power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag. And that word ``desecration'' is loaded. It is loaded with ambiguity. It is laden with value. And it will inevitably lead to trouble. To desecrate, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder.  Here is what the dictionary says desecrate means:       To divert from a sacred to a profane use or purpose; to      treat with sacrilege; to put to unworthy use.  So to determine whether an action desecrates, we must first make a value judgment about what the message the actor is trying to convey is. We usually talk about desecration in terms of our religious values--to desecrate a cross or a crucifix, to desecrate a menorah, to desecrate a temple, to desecrate a church, to desecrate a sacristy, to desecrate a host. Although I revere the flag, I do not put the flag on the same level as the sacred symbols of our varying religions. It is a different thing. We have never decided that any of our civil actions should rise to the level of spiritual undertaking. And so when you talk about desecration, you have to understand that you are applying and allowing the application of value judgments that we will attach to the actions of the actor who is desecrating the flag.  Does he mean to profane the flag? What does that mean? Obviously, we have to determine that subjectively, whether it profanes the flag. Does her action treat the flag irreverently or contemptuously? Is the flag being put to an unworthy use?  When we make those kinds of value judgments, we are not making the act of burning the flag a crime. We are making the message behind the act the crime. I will refer to this later. But is it in fact putting the flag to an unworthy use to put it on the side of a hot dog vendor's stand? Maybe that is all right. In one community, they may say that is a good idea.  How about the guy who runs the pornographic theater, and on one side of the marquee he puts some lewd and obscene or profane or pornographic title of a film being shown inside and on the other side he drapes the American flag. Is that putting it to an unworthy use?  How about the woman who buys the revealing thong bikini that is made in a flag. Is that profaning the flag? Is she to be arrested?  How about the woman who buys the $5,000 sequin dress that has a flag on it? Is that profaning the flag? Does it matter what her figure is like to determine what use the flag is being put to?  I rode in a parade recently in my home State, and it was a parade that was honoring the war dead. It was Memorial Day. We went by on Union Street in Wilmington, DE, the home of a black veteran, and he proudly had his flag flying on his front porch on a row house, and on the other side of the flag sewn perfectly so it was the exact same size was the African national symbol, black, red, and green. Is that profaning the flag? He meant it out of respect. He was a war veteran. If I am not mistaken, he had been president of one of our veterans organizations. Is that profaning the flag? Well, in Maine, maybe it would not be profaning the flag. In southern Delaware or Alabama it maybe would be viewed as profaning the flag.  Who makes those choices--the local constable, the local cop, the local censor? That is the crux of my objection to this amendment. It makes not the act but the message the crime. And in doing so it gives the Congress and the States license to discriminate between types of speech they like and types of speech they do not like. But you do not have to take my word for it.  Back in the bad old days, when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee and subsequently as the ranking member, we held extensive hearings about the exact same amendment 5 and 6 years ago, and we heard from its authors, then members of the Bush administration, noble and honorable men, and they pulled no punches to this question. They admitted right out that the goal was to allow the Government to discriminate between bad flag burners and good flag burners.  More specifically, then Assistant Attorney General William Barr, who became Attorney General of the United States, and a fine one, in my view, in 1989 said that the message, ``Would permit the legislature to focus on the kind of conduct that is really offensive.'' He said that there is ``an infinite number of forms of desecration and that States would have substantial discretion in fashioning flag laws.''  One year later, Acting Assistant Attorney General Michael Luttig testified that the goal of the amendment was to ``punish only actors that were intending to convey contempt.''  Now, when I heard him say that, I wanted to make sure I did not misunderstand, so I asked Mr. Luttig point blank, would it be permissible under this amendment to pass laws discriminating between types of expression--not types of burning; you use the same match, same flag--but the type of expression that went along when you were burning the flag. Was that the purpose? And he said, ``That is correct. You could punish that desecration which you thought was intended to be disrespectful toward the flag and not that which in your judgment was not.''  If I am not mistaken, I remember the example I gave. I said, how about if there are two veterans at the war memorial, the Vietnam War Memorial, and they each go down and they have their own flag, and he kneels down before the wall, one of them, and one happens to be a woman. And she takes out the flag, very respectfully, puts it in an urn, puts a little lighter fluid on it and lights it, and says, ``I'm offering this flag up to purify the soul of my deceased husband whose name is on the wall and fought valiantly for his country in a noble effort.''  And another Vietnam veteran comes down and kneels down, takes out an urn, puts a flag in it, and puts lighter fluid on it and lights it, and says, ``I'm offering this flag up in anger for the wasted lives of my friends and brothers who are on this wall''--in anger--``for what my country did to them.''  If there is a park cop, a D.C. cop standing there, what does he do? And he says, ``Arrest the veteran who said he is burning this flag out of anger, but do not arrest the widow who is burning this flag to honor.''  That will be the first time in the history of the United States of America we passed a law that was constitutional--because, by definition, a constitutional amendment will be constitutional--that said, ``Government, you can choose to punish those who say things you don't like, and let those who say things you do like go for the same exact physical act that they engage in.''  Now, ladies and gentlemen, how does that stop? Where does that stop? Do we really want the Federal Government, let alone the 50 States, to be able to make those judgments that we have never allowed before? Lest anyone say to me that things have somehow changed this year, I point to the committee report that was just published by the Judiciary Committee. The majority views make it clear that viewpoint, neutrality--that issue I talked about earlier--is neither a goal nor an attribute of the proposed legislation.  Here is what the attending committee report to this constitutional amendment says: ``The committee,'' meaning the Judiciary Committee, ``does wish to empower Congress and the States to prohibit contemptuous or disrespectful physical treatment of the flag. The committee does not wish to compel the Congress and the States to penalize respectful treatment of the flag.''  You all think I am kidding about this? Any of the people in this Chamber who listened, you get 1,000 catalogs in the mail, everyone from L.L. Bean to, I do not know, all these catalogs. Look at the catalogs you get for swimsuits. Look at them--not even ones you asked to have sent to you--and you will see the swimsuits, men and women's are flags--a flag.   In some parts of my community, someone wearing a one-piece swimsuit with a flag on it would not be viewed as disrespectful, someone wearing a two-piece swimsuit would maybe not be, someone wearing a bikini may very well be. And you think--I know this is funny, but it is real. It is real. These are real things. You are going to empower some local cop, some local community, to make a judgment. If I show up in boxer shorts, a kind of swimsuit with a flag on it, no problem. If some young, 19-year-old, muscle-bound guy shows up in a bikini with it on, well, they may say that is kind of offensive, that is too revealing.  Is that the business we want to get into? And, by the way, what is a flag? Is the flag a decal? You stick a decal on the side of a hot-dog vendor stand. Well, what is that? What happens if they take these little flags, these little decal things they hand out and put pins on--some are stickers--and burn one of those? Is that desecrating the flag? Is that the business we want to get into as a nation?  Also, this year the proponents of this amendment highlighted the testimony of former Assistant Attorney General Charles Cooper. Here is what former Assistant Attorney General Charles Cooper had to say a few months ago.       [P]ublic sentiment is not neutral.  Parenthetically, I would note that is a profound observation.       [P]ublic sentiment is not ``neutral''; it is not      indifferent to the circumstances surrounding conduct relating      to the flag. If such conduct is dignified and respectful, I      daresay that the American people and their elected      representatives do not want to prohibit it; if such conduct      is disrespectful and contemptuous of the flag, I believe that      they do.  I believe that, too. It makes my blood boil when I read the testimony of that young guy standing on the floor on the steps of the capitol in Texas saying, ``Red, white, and blue, I spit on you,'' and burning a flag. They are the kind of things that--fortunately, most of us were not around--they are the kind of things that literally start fights with people who do not have a lot of self-control in circumstances like that. And I probably would fit in that category.  But what is the difference? We are going to allow--obviously, public sentiment is not neutral on anything. It is not neutral on what we say about--I happen to be a Roman Catholic. It is not neutral on how some of the far-right folks talk about my church. I do not like the way they talk about the Pope. I do not like the kind of comments they make. I find it offensive. I happen to be a member of the largest single denomination in the United States of America because 33 percent of us are Catholic. There are more Catholics in here than any other single denomination in the Congress, if I am not mistaken.  Should we pass a law saying, ``It offends me. It offends me. You can't say those things about my church''? Is that a good idea? That is content. That is content.  So when we talk about the public is not neutral, they are not neutral on anything. Should people have a right to stand up and offend us as some do and make pro-Communist speeches or what about these defiling Nazi types around this country? What about these militia guys, some of whom wear swastikas? I am not labeling all militia people, but some are. The white supremacists--it makes my blood boil when I hear what they say about our country, about Jews, about blacks. But, guess what, folks? They are entitled to say it. It offends all of us, 95 percent of us.  So if I decide, as Mr. Cooper says, public sentiment is not neutral, it is not neutral on that, it is not neutral on the Ku Klux Klan, it is not neutral on white supremacist organizations, it is overwhelmingly opposed, so because it is not neutral, we go with a majority sentiment? Are we prepared to say that? Are we prepared to outlaw their speech? Well, it would make me feel good. I would like to do it. But if we go for them today, who do we go for next?  How about the time when people stood up 40 years ago and made speeches about black equality, made speeches about the rights of blacks to participate in our society? The majority of folks in certain parts of the country, including my State, were not for that. Would they be able to pass a law in the State of Delaware saying you cannot say that? ``You're a rabble-rouser, talking about that 19 percent of my population that is black having equal rights.''  Probably a significant portion of the American public is offended by some of the more militant aspects of the gay and lesbian movement who stand up and make speeches about what their rights are. The fact that it is not neutral, that we are not neutral on that subject as a nation, then we have a right to outlaw it?  I believe that this whole argument misses--the argument made by those who talk about whether we are neutral on it or not, that we should be able to act on what we are not neutral about--misses the greatest constitutional point.  It misses, indeed, the genius of the first amendment. Here in America the majority, by and large, does not get to choose what can and cannot be said by the minority, or by anyone else for that matter. And the Government, more importantly, is constitutionally restrained from deciding what speech is good and what speech is bad. But that is precisely what the proponents of this amendment say it would do and should do. Let me be precise.  That is what the senatorial and congressional proponents of this amendment mean for it to do. I really do not believe the vast majority of the members of the American Legion and the vast majority of veterans groups and the vast majority of Americans know that it will do this. I do not think they thought that one through. But that is precisely what the proponents of the amendment say it would do and should do. They would have the flag emblazoned with the slogan ``Government is great'' treated differently than one that says, ``Government is rotten.''  Get that flag, put on it, ``The U.S. Government is great.'' Does that deface the flag? Put on the same flag, ``The U.S. Government is rotten,'' and what is that? Is that OK? Well, as a U.S. Senator who has occasionally had some scurrilous things said about him because I am part of the Government and because I am who I am, I sure would like to have the power to pass a law saying, ``You can't say bad things about me, I'm part of the Government, only good things about me. If they are bad things, you can't say them.''  I would like all the newspaper editors in America to understand that from now on, we may have an amendment that you cannot say anything bad about a U.S. Senator, notwithstanding the fact we deserve it and I deserve it.  Under this amendment, the State could send to jail the fringe artist displaying the flag on the floor of an art museum while giving its blessing to a veteran who displays the flag on the ground at a war memorial. That, I believe, is not content neutral.  The State could, as I said, arrest the widow who burns the flag to protest the war that took her husband's life while smiling on the widow who burns the flag in memory of her fallen husband. I believe this type of viewpoint discrimination exacts too high a constitutional price to protect the flag. As Justice Jackson so memorably put it in the flag statute case of 1943:       The very purpose of the Bill of Rights was to withdraw      certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political      controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and      officials. . . If there is any fixed star in our      constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or      petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics,      nationalism, religion or other matters of opinion or force      citizens to confess by word or act or faith therein.  What it boils down to is this: This amendment, as presently drafted, allows the Government to pick and choose, to make flag burning illegal only in certain situations involving only certain circumstances and only if carried out by certain people and only for the time in question, because 2 years later, 5 years later, 20 years later, 40 years later, it can change.  This discrimination is precisely and most profoundly what the first amendment forbids, and the amendment that works this kind of discrimination does not protect the flag, it censors speech.  Another problem with the amendment is that it fails to define the word ``flag.'' This would add yet another layer of difficulty in interpretation and application and open the door further to inconsistencies among the States. Again, each State would have considerable discretion to craft its own definition, and, again, the possibilities are nearly endless.   As Assistant Attorney General Barr testified, the legislation would be able to criminalize conduct dealing not only with the flag as we know it but with, and I quote, ``descriptions of the flag, such as posters, murals, pictures, buttons or other representations of the flag.''  Indeed, Mr. Barr, in speaking in favor of such a sweeping definition, said that it would, and I quote again, be: ``consistent with the Government's interest in preserving the flag's symbolic value because it recognizes that the desecration of representations of the flag damage that interest as much as the desecration of the flag itself.''  So in Maine, it might be a crime to draw a flag being fed into a shredding machine. In California, it might be a crime to wear a sequined dress in the pattern of a flag or a flag bikini or T-shirt. In Mississippi, the legislature might make it a crime to put a flag decal on the side of a hot dog vending machine.  This sort of disparity among State laws, whether it is over the meaning of ``desecration'' or the definition of ``flag,'' is especially inappropriate here where we are talking about the Nation's symbol. This is not the symbol of Mississippi or Delaware, Alabama, South Carolina, California, Maine, or Montana. It is the national symbol. The reason it is worth preserving is because it unifies this diverse Nation, and the notion that a single State can determine what that should be is, on its face, preposterous.  I understand that there is a possibility that the distinguished Senator from Alabama, Senator Heflin, and others, may have an amendment to amend this amendment to take out the right of the States to do this. I am not sure of that, but that is what I understand. That would be a positive step, because it is, on its face ludicrous--ludicrous--to allow each State to determine how much they are going to protect the national symbol.  Some States in the past, and I do not say this disrespectfully, decided it should not be our national symbol and decided to have another flag. I do not want any State telling me what that symbol should be and how it should be treated. It is a national symbol.  It is a symbol of the Nation, not of the States, and an amendment which will foster a crazy quilt of laws all across the map misses the point and an important one: It will be more divisive than unifying.  Why is it any less reprehensible to burn a flag in Louisiana than it is in Montana? Why should we be able to wear a flag T-shirt in a wet T-shirt contest in Arkansas or Delaware and not in Florida or California?  Moreover, constitutional rights and principles should know no geographic boundaries. A Delawarean should not be accorded greater freedom of speech than his neighbor across the way in Pennsylvania. A Californian should not have more due process rights than her cousin up north in the State of Washington.  If we want to protect the flag, we should have one national viewpoint-neutral standard. The Constitution, after all, stands for proud and broad principles, not a patchwork of 50 different and idiosyncratic ideas. I agree that we should honor the flag. We should hold it high in our hearts and in our law, but we should not dishonor the Constitution in the process.  With all due respect for my good friends, Orrin Hatch and Howell Heflin, I think this amendment does violence to the core of the first amendment principle of viewpoint neutrality. This is the price that I am unwilling to pay. But more to the point, it is a price we do not have to pay to protect the flag. We can do both: Preserve the first amendment in viewpoint neutrality, and we can protect the flag and preserve the first amendment at the same time. And that is what the amendment I now propose seeks to do.                           Amendment No. 3093   (Purpose: Proposing an amendment to the Constitution authorizing  Congress to protect the physical integrity of the flag of the United                                 States)
