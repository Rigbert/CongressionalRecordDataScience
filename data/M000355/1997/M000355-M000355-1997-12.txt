 President, I rise today to recognize the career of Bob Carter, an outstanding newsman, who is retiring after more than four decades in the news business. Bob served for the last 28 years as president and general manager of the Kentucky New Era in Hopkinsville, KY. Bob is a great Kentuckian who has worked hard for the people of his community. He is a great friend, and he truly will be missed.  Bob was 19 years old when he started working for the Kentucky New Era. He took the job so he could save enough money to go to college to study architecture. But along the way, he met his future wife Ann and decided to call Hopkinsville his home. His first job at the paper was selling ads, but after 5 years, he was named manager of the advertising department. In 1969, Bob became president and general manager of the paper. At that time, the newspaper had about 30 employees and a daily circulation of 7,000 readers. Today the newspaper has 82 employees, a circulation of 15,500, and several holdings, including the local television station.  At the beginning of his career, Bob was primarily interested in the business aspect of the newspaper. He fought to get the newspaper headquartered in its current home, and to invest heavily in new equipment. It's an investment that paid off. In the early 1970's, Hopkinsville's economy began to grow and so did the Kentucky New Era. And what better way to sum it up than to quote Bob from his own newspaper, ``We grabbed onto that whirlwind and rode with it.'' He went on to add, ``We became a cheerleader for the community. We were a supporter and a critic. We challenged some people to do things that weren't being done.''  Retirement in Bob's case doesn't mean that he will slow down. He will continue to serve as chairman of the Kentucky New Era Board of Directors, and will work in an advisory capacity to assist his replacements through the end of the year. Bob will remain active in his community, as a member of the Association of the U.S. Army, the Chamber of Commerce's Military Affairs Committee, and as the newspaper's ``ambassador'' at Fort Campbell. He will also be able to spend more time with his wife, Ann, and his two daughters, Beth and Jini.  Mr. President, I commend Bob Carter for his outstanding service to the people of Hopkinsville, KY. I ask that you and my fellow colleagues join me in recognizing the career of this outstanding Kentuckian, and wishing him well in all his future pursuits.                          ____________________
