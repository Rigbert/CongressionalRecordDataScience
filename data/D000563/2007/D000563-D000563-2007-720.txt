The Republican leader has said: No, we want to delay this. We want to delay this until tomorrow and then perhaps another 2 days beyond and to filibuster it during that period of time.  It would seem there is a pattern emerging, a very clear pattern where it comes to the important business. Whether it is ethics reform or changing the policy in Iraq, the Republican position is to stop the process, slow down the process, throw in every obstacle they can find.  I ask the majority leader if this pattern has been evidenced in terms of, for example, filibusters, delaying tactics on the part of the Republicans?
