President, I tell my friend from North Dakota, not only would it be an appropriate course because cloture is not going to be invoked primarily because, for one major reason because of his qualifications, but also because the rules of the Judiciary Committee were not followed in having this nomination go out.  We could very well at that time, if we want to get judges through, not have this cloture vote, which is not going to go anywhere. We have James Cohn, of Florida. During this time we could have voted on him to be a judge. We could have voted on Frank Montalvo, of Texas. These are nominees I would support and I think a majority of us would support. Xavier Rodriguez, of Texas, could have been voted on. The Republicans have made no effort to bring them up, even though we told them they could. H. Brent McKnight, of North Carolina--these are people we would allow to being brought up. We would allow the home State Senators to take a few minutes to speak about them. In fact, they could bring them all up and do them in a stack of 10-minute rollcall votes. They would have gone through in the amount of time of some our quorum calls today.
