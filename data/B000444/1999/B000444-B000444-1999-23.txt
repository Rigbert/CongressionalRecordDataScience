 President, on October 13, the Broadcasting Board of Governors--which supervises all U.S. Government-sponsored international broadcasting--held a ceremony celebrating its new status as an independent agency.  Among the speakers was the President of Estonia, Lennart Meri, who delivered a very thoughtful and eloquent speech on the importance of international broadcasting to the mission of promoting democracy and freedom around the world.  I commend it to all of my colleagues. I ask to have printed in the Record, the text of President Meri's speech.  The speech follows:           The Unfinished Tasks of International Broadcasting  (By Lennart Meri, President of the Republic of Estonia, Washington,                          D.C., 13 October 1999)       No one talking in this city about the importance of the      media could fail to recall Thomas Jefferson's observation      that if he were forced to choose between a free press and a      free parliament, he would always choose the former because      with a free press and a free parliament, he would end with a      free parliament, but with a free parliament, he could not be      sure if he would end with a free press.       I certainly won't become the exception to that practice.      But if these words of your third president and the author of      the American Declaration of Independence continue to resonate      around the world, one of his other observations about the      press may be more relevant for our thinking about the current      and future tasks of international broadcasting. Responding in      June 1807 to a Virginia resident who was thinking about      starting a newspaper, Jefferson argued that ``to be most      useful,'' a newspaper should contain ``true facts and sound      principles only.''       Unfortunately, he told his correspondent, ``I fear such a      paper would find few subscribers'' because ``it is a      melancholy truth that a suppression of the press could not      more completely deprive the nation of its benefits than is      done by its abandoned prostitution to falsehood.'' And one of      the greatest advocates of the power of the media to support      democracy concluded sadly, ``nothing can now be believed      which is seen in a newspaper. Truth itself becomes suspicious      by being put into that polluted vehicle.''       Jefferson's optimistic comment about the role of a free      press came as he was helping to make the revolution that      transformed the world; his more critical ones came after his      own, often less than happy years as president of the United      States. Given my own experiences over the past half century,      I can fully understand his shift in perspective and can thus      testify that were Thomas Jefferson to be with us today, he      would be among the most committed advocates of international      broadcasting precisely because of his experiences in the      earlier years of the American republic.       For most of my adult life, I lived in an occupied country,      one where the communist regime suppressed virtually all      possibilities for free expression in public forums. As a      result, we turned to international broadcasting like Radio      Free Europe, Radio Liberty, the Voice of America, and the BBC      to try to find out what was going on.       Let me go back in memory for a moment. Estonia was already      under Soviet occupation when the ``Battle of Britain''--     solitary England's solitary battle against the totalitarian      world--began. This is how I saw it, at the age of twelve,      before our family was deported to Siberia. Nazi Germany      bombastically boasted of its victories, London spoke of      losses. And yet each broadcast from London, day after day,      ended with the English newscaster's dry announcement: ``Das      waren die Nachrichten am 5. Juni, am hundert sechs und      funfzigsten Tage des Jahres, wo Hitler versprach, den Krieg      zu gewinnen.''--``These were the news of June 15, 156th day      of the year when Hitler promised to win the war''. There was      no irony in these words. Rather, there was the pedantic      knowledge of a pharmacist--how many drops of truth      morning, day and night were necessary to keep the ability      of doubt alive. The end of World War II found me in exile,      buried deep into the heart of Russia, a couple of hundred      kilometers from the nearest railway station. You had your      Victory Day celebrations, and so had I. I bought a crystal      of selenium to build a radio receiver. During the time of      war, all radio equipment had been confiscated in Russia.      Now, suddenly, I was holding in my hands a thumb's length      of a glass tube containing a crystal and a short wire--my      pass to freedom. The third receiver, built already in      Estonia, finally worked, and I have been with you ever      since. I doubt whether it is in my powers to give you a      convincing picture of our spiritual confinement. Imagine      being blind, unable to see colours, to perceive light or      shadows; being surrounded by the void space without a      single point of reference, without gravity that would feel      like motherly love in this spiritual vacuum. And then, for      a quarter of an hour, or half an hour, or even--a royal      luxury--for a whole hour--the void would suddenly be      filled with colours, fragrances, voices, the warmth of the      sun and the fresh hope of spring. How many of you remember      the Moscow Conference of 1946, to which so many Estonians      for some unknown reason looked forward with hope? I      remember Mr. Peter Peterson from the BBC covering the      conference, I remember, the intonation of Winston      Churchill, when he said of the winners of this very      ``Battle of Britain'': ``That was their finest hour''. I      remember the lectures of astronomer Fred Hoyle, to which I      listened taking notes from week to week. Under Soviet      rule, his discovery was banned as ``idealistic''.       Some years ago, when I received Javier Solana, the      Secretary-General of NATO, in Tallinn, I compared the      inevitability of the expansion of the island of democracy and     NATO security structures with Fred Hoyle's expanding      universe, and noticed when I was still speaking that Mr.      Salona was deeply and personally moved by my speech. ``You      could not have known,'' he said afterwards, ``that Fred Hoyle      was during my university studies my research subject.'' This      is how the radiation from an antenna materialises into      attitudes, actions, and landscapes. Allow me two more      comments. It is my duty to thank from this chair your      predecessors for the decision to start broadcasts in Estonian      on Radio Liberty, and even more for the decision to transfer      the broadcasts in Estonian to the responsibility area of      Radio Free Europe--in full concord with the non-recognition      policy of the United States. I do not know how this decision      was taken. During the Korean War, I heard from the Russian      broadcasts, that the next day, the first Estonian broadcast      would be on the air at 1800 hours. I was still a student and      lived in Tartu, in a dormitory, which housed more than 500      students. I mentioned the forthcoming Estonian broadcast to      one single friend. Stalin's terror was rampant in Estonia.      For the time when the broadcast begun, my room was full of      people, and more were coming. I will never forget that day,      those solemn thirty minutes, and least of all the atmosphere      in my room. Those people were the friends of my friend's      friends. I knew a few, most were strangers to me. Every      listener stood apart, in different directions, motionless, no      glance met another, no word was spoken, we parted in silence.      Such gatherings were punished with twenty-five years of hard      labour. Not a single one of these twenty or thirty people got      into trouble, which bespeaks of a high morale.       And my last point. I have myself worked at the radio, and      know and knew the most distressing doubt--or ignorance, to be      more accurate--whether your message did find your listeners.      The broadcaster's work is like a dialogue with the stars:      he can hear his own voice, but never gets any answer. The      listener's temptation to respond is overwhelming. In      spring 1976 Radio Free Europe informed that the Estonian      polar explorer. August Massik had died in Canada. I picked      up the phone and dictated a message for the writers'      newspaper, and it appeared two days later, on June 18. In      the circumstances of totalitarian seclusion, this was      quite an accomplishment, which, I hoped, would morally      support Radio Free Europe's Estonian staff. I must      confess, I also wrote to your countryman Alistair Cooke      the following lines, and I am quoting: ``Your word has      always penetrated the Iron Curtain. Every week you have      been a member of our family. I don't remember if you have      ever spoken about Estonia, but you have always spoken as a      European about the democratic world, which is the same''.      I was deeply moved to get Alistair Cooke's reply, which I      would very much like to read to this audience: ``It will      be plain to you'', Alistair Cooke wrote, ``why I      particularly cherish letters from people who listened,      sometimes at their peril, from behind the Iron Curtain. Of      all such, your letter is at once the most touching and the      most gratifying. I am deeply grateful to you and wish you      all good things as you approach what (to me) is early      middle age! Most sincerely, etc. Alistar Cooke''. That was      the role you have played, and I doubt whether you yourself      are aware of how much an antenna can outweight the world's      biggest army.       Frequently, these sources provided the only reliable news      we could get about what was going on not only in the outside      world but also in our own country. These broadcasts were our      universities: They provided us with the materials we needed      to understand our world and ultimately to build a movement      capable of reclaiming our rightful place in world.       Indeed, one of the key moments in the recovery of the      independence of my country is directly tied to international      broadcasting. On January 13, 1991, Russian leader Brois      Yeltsin flew to Tallinn in the aftermath of the Soviet      killings in Lithuania. While there, he not only signed      agreements acknowledging the right of the Baltic states to      seek independence from the Soviet Union but he issued a      statement calling on Russian officers and men not to obey      illegal Soviet orders to fire on freely elected governments      or unarmed civilians.       Through a series of FM and telephone connections from      Tallinn via Helsinki to Stockholm to Munich, Yeltin's words      reached REF/RL's Estonian Service and then were broadcast      throughout the Soviet Union on all of that station's language      services. I am convinced that that broadcasting by itself      prevented Moscow from taking even more radical steps against      our national movement and thus set the stage for the recovery      of our independence as well as for the dissolution of the      Evil Empire as a whole.       Just one indication of how important that action was to us      is the fact that the head of RFL/FL's Estonian Service at      that time, Toomas Hendrik Ilves, is now Estonian foreign      minister.       I can't stress too highly what these broadcasts meant to me      and to my fellow Estonians in another sense as well. During      the long years of occupation, these broadcasts in our own      languages demonstrated that the world, and that there was no      basis for pessimism about our future. And these broadcasts,      especially those which were about our country, reminded not      only us but the Soviet Authorities that they would never      be able to prevent us from regaining our freedom.       When we finally did so in 1991, I like many other Estonians      and, I suspect, like many of you, looked to the future with      enormous self-confidence. and also like many of you, I was      sure that the chief contribution of international      broadcasting to my country lay in the past. Indeed, it was in      that spirit that I nominated Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty      for the Novel Peace Prize, an honor I still believe it should      ultimately receive.       Surely, we thought, with communism overthrown and with our      own independence reaffirmed, we could quickly establish our      own free press, one that would provide our citizens with the      information they would need not only to recover from the past      but to allow us to re-enter Europe and the West.       But the experience of the past eight years has shown that      such optimism was misplaced. First of all, the privatisation      of the media did not make it free. Because of economic      difficulties, privatisation both reduced the number of media      outlets, thus paradoxically stifling freedom, and encouraged      those remaining to seek readers and listeners by appealing to      the lowest common denominator among our citizens. Instead of      elevating the understanding of their audiences, all too many      of our media outlets played to the worst in them, filling      their pages or their broadcasts with sex, violence, and      charges of corruption.       That is why I have complained so often that the path from a      controlled press to a free press all too often lies through      the worst kind of yellow press.       There is a second reason why our optimism about our own      domestic media was misplaced; the experiences and values of      the editors and journalists who now work in the domestic      media. Not surprisingly, almost all of them are products of      the Soviet system. Their understanding of what the media is      for and what they do is thus very different from that of      journalists who have grown up in a free media environment.      They see media outlets as a form of propaganda, something the      new owners frequently even encourage, and they see individual      news stories as a chance to push their own agendas rather      than to report accurately on what is going on.       And there is yet a third reason why we expected too much      too soon in this area after the collapse of communism. A free      press needs a free audience be it readers or listeners, and      such an audience is not something that has been created      overnight in any country.       It did not happen overnight even in the United States which      never faced the same kind of tyranny that we did. Indeed,      Jefferson complained about this as well when he said that for      the citizens of his day, ``defamation is becoming a necessity      of life; in so much that a dish of tea in the morning or      evening cannot be digested without this stimulant.''       But the impact of the Soviet system in my country was far      deeper and more insidious than that and far deeper and more      insidious than many people either in Estonia or in the West      want to acknowledge. It involved more than the mass      executions and deportations, more than the destruction of      much of the landscape, and more than 50 years of the      stifling of our lives. It involved in the very first and      most important sense the deformation of our minds and      souls, a deformation that means that even today many of us      cannot confront reality except through the filters      provided by that past. Estonian is not an easy language to      learn, but any of you who can listen to Estonian      broadcasts or who read Estonian newspapers or journals      will immediately feel what you are listening to or reading      is something very different from the media you are used to      in this long-established democracy. And if you listen or      read while you visit my country--and I invite all of you      to do so--you will be shocked by the difference between      what you hear and see in the media and what you hear and      see all around you.       Jefferson again understood this problem when he wrote:      ``The real extent of this misinformation is known only to      those who are in situations to confront facts within their      knowledge with the lies of the day.'' And he added that ``I      really look with commiseration over the great body of my      fellow citizens, who, reading newspapers, live and die in the      belief, that they have known something of what has been      passing in the world in their time.''       I share that feeling almost every time I pick up an      Estonian paper or listen to a broadcast by a domestic      Estonian outlet.       Now, lest you accuse me of being overly pessimistic, let me      hasten to add that there are notable exceptions among owners,      among journalists and especially among readers and listeners.      There are owners of media outlets in my country who do      believe in the principles of a genuinely free press. There      are journalists who understand that news is not the same as      propaganda and that checking facts is important. And there      are many readers and listeners who know what genuine news is      and increasingly expect to get that and not the poor      substitute they are often given.       One of the reasons that I have some optimism about the      future of the free media is that our very oldest citizens      remember the media from before the Soviet occupation and our      very youngest are growing up without the constraints of the      communist system. These two groups have been responsible for      most of the positive changes in our country since 1991 not      only in the media but in all fields of endeavor. Indeed, I      think it is symbolic that I am a representative of those who      remember Estonia before the Soviets came     and our prime minister Mart Laar, perhaps the youngest      national leader in the world, came of age as they were      leaving.       Another reason I am somewhat more optimistic than you may      think is that international broadcasting has already done      some important work. Those of us who listened to what the      Soviets called the ``foreign voices'' not only heard the news      but learned what news is--and importantly what it isn't. Many      of our best journalists have been regular listeners to RFE/     RL, to VOA, to the BBC and to all the others for their entire      lives. That gave them the courage to think differently and a      model for their profession. Without it, we would have been      much further behind.       But there is a final reason for my optimism: the continuing      impact of international broadcasting to my country and to its      neighbors. Estonians and many other people around the world      fudge their own media on the basis of what      international broadcasting tells them. That operates as an      important constraint on the tendency of domestic media      operations to go off the rails, but it also means that      these audiences are learning what news is and thus will      demand it from their domestic outlets. And when they do,      then there will be genuinely free press and the      possibility of genuinely free society.       Consequently, I am now convinced that the greatest      challenges for international broadcasting lie ahead and not      in the past, for overcoming the problems Jefferson identified      two centuries ago is not going to be easy or quick. Estonia      as many of you know has done remarkably well compared to many      of the other post-communist countries, but our problems are      still so great in the media areas as elsewhere that we will      continue to need your help and your broadcasts long into the      future.       On behalf of the Estonian people, I want to thank you in      the United States for all you have done in the past and are      doing now through your broadcasts to my country and to other      countries around the world. I believe that international      broadcasting is and will remain one of the most important      means for the spread of democracy and freedom. And      consequently, I am very proud to greet you today on the      occasion of the formation of the Broadcasting Board of      Governors as an independent agency--even though I want all of      you who are celebrating that fact to know that your greatest      challenges lie ahead and that those of us who are your chief      beneficiaries will never let you forget it.       Thank you.                          ____________________
