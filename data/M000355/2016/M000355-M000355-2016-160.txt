 President, it has been a busy and exciting week as we have welcomed new Members, assembled our leadership teams for the 115th Congress, and gotten to work on important issues.  Today we will have an opportunity to take up a bill that is particularly important for Gulf Coast States like Louisiana. Senator Cassidy has been a leader on this issue, and I appreciate the work he has done to bring this measure up for a vote.  Sometime this session we will also take up an extension of the Iran Sanctions Extension Act, which passed the House overwhelmingly. This bipartisan bill will provide the basis for any sanctions that may be reimposed on Iran, which is critical, given the belligerent behavior exhibited by Tehran since the signing of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. I expect we will pass it on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis here as well.  Discussions are also ongoing on how to fund the government and for how long, as I noted yesterday. I will have more to say on that issue as more details are available.  So we all have some work to do. Let's get together to finish up the business of this Congress as we begin looking forward to the next.                          ____________________
