 President, I present this amendment on behalf of Senators Sununu, Gregg, Wyden, Cantwell, Feingold, Burr, McCain, Kerry, Collins, Clinton, Schumer, Snowe, and myself.  In April of this year, the President of the United States stated this:       With oil at more than $50 a barrel, energy companies do not      need taxpayer-funded incentives to explore for oil and gas.  Before a joint Senate hearing last week, the big companies--ExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, BP, and Shell--said they do not need these tax incentives. Each CEO said they did not need it.  This amendment removes those tax incentives. I think the time has come to do that.
