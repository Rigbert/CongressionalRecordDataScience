President, let me go through the list. As I made the statement, it is important that people recognize how long staff works around here. Quite frankly, I have often said, when they come around for a report from our committee--the Environment and Public Works Committee, the committee that has the largest jurisdiction in the entire U.S. Senate--we are the committee that gets things done.  If we look at the variety of philosophies that are present praising this work that is being done, we had the very most conservative to the very most progressive of Members, and it is not just this bill. We did the highway reauthorization bill, something that had to wait for about 8 years to get done, the largest one since 1998. We had the WRDA bill, which we anticipate is going to be a reality. It has come out of our committee. This committee also has jurisdiction over the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and then all of the public works. As my ranking member, Senator Boxer, has said several times during this process, we get things done.  Now, we do disagree on a lot of the issues on the environment. As I say to my good friends on the other side of the aisle, you have every right to be wrong, but we get things done, and I appreciate that very much.  Senator McCain, I already thanked you for yielding to us to allow us to pass one of the most significant bills which we just passed by voice vote.  Mr. McCAIN. I would be glad to be thanked again.
