President, I must express my amazement with the priorities of the Senator from North Dakota. He wants to cut $300 million from the missile defense. He says we have higher domestic priorities. We heard about the nutrition programs, we heard about all these social programs that seem to, in his mind, have a higher priority.  I suggest to you that this $300 million is a relatively small amount of money. The one bomb in Oklahoma City that wiped out the Murrah Federal Building cost the taxpayers $500 million--one bomb.  I suggest if the Senator from North Dakota could have stood with me in Oklahoma City on April 19, April 20, April 21, when they are sending troops and volunteers into this building to pull out people who might be alive in there, the hope was there that more would be alive, then the fourth day came and the smell of death had enveloped the city, if you could have been there, and what was going through my mind was, this is just one building in one city, one missile could come in there and wipe out every building in the city of Oklahoma City, in the city of Sioux Falls, SD, in Bismarck, ND, in New York City, could wipe out the entire thing.  Multiply that one thing, the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City by 100, by 1,000. That is the threat that is out there. That is the threat that can reach, according to many in the intelligence community, this country within 5 years. We have to be ready for that. This should be the highest priority. We are elected to defend America. That is exactly what this is about today.  So, Mr. President, in the strongest of terms, I say this is the minimum that we can do to keep on force, to have a national missile defense system in place in 5 years when the threat is very real.
