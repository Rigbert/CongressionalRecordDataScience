Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3378 was passed by the House earlier this year, sent to the other body, amended by the other body and sentback to us for further action. The other body amended the bill to make technical amendments to certain provisions in the Health Care Improvement Act and authorized several Indian Health care demonstration programs, the year 2000.  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record a letter dated September 25 from Chairman Thomas J. Bliley, Jr. This letter explains the support of the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Bliley] for 3378, as amended.  The letter referred to follows:                                         House of Representatives,                                        Committee on Commerce,                               Washington, DC, September 25, 1996.     Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, Committee on Resources,     U.S. House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Senate recently passed an amended      version of H.R. 3378, a bill to amend the Indian Health Care      Improvement Act to extend the demonstration program for      direct billing of Medicare, Medicaid, and other third party      payors. I remain concerned about the implications of passing      this measure, but appreciate your interest in having it move      forward, since the projects would otherwise expire September      30, 1996.       It is my understanding that the Committee on Resources      would like to bring the measure up for Floor consideration,      with an amendment negotiated among the House Committee on      Commerce, the House Committee on Resources, and the Senate      Committee on Indian Affairs. Based on our agreement to drop      section 2(b)(1)(A)(iv), and to include in the record of the      debate the statement regarding scholarship paybacks, the      Committee on Commerce will not object to Floor consideration      of H.R. 3378.       By participating in this process of expending consideration      of H.R. 3378, this Committee does not waive its      jurisdictional interest in the matter. Although I understand      a conference of this measure is unlikely, I reserve the right      to seek conferees on issues within the jurisdiction of the      Commerce Committee during any House-Senate conference that      may be convened.       I want to thank you and your staff for your cooperation in      this process. I would appreciate your including this letter      as part of the record during consideration of this bill by      the House.           Sincerely,                                  Thomas J. Bliley, Jr., Chairman.  Mr. Speaker, in conclusion I note that the managers have amended the other body's amendment to delete certain language which we feel is unnecessary.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3378 is an important piece of legislation which has been admitted and then readmitted. It is a good bill, and I urge my colleagues to give it full support.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3378 was passed by this House earlier this year, sent to the other body, amended by the other body, and sent back to us for further action.  The other body amended the bill to make technical amendments to certain provisions of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act and to reauthorize several Indian health care demonstration programs through the year 2000.  Among the technical amendments to the Indian Health Care Improvement Act made by the other body was legislation which clarifies that the Secretary may waive or modify the service obligation requirements, under the Indian health scholarship program, in a case of extreme hardship or for other good cause.  In the past, the Secretary has granted a small number of such waivers, in accord with National Health Service Corps regulations. This change clarifies that this authority may be exercised specifically for the Indian health service scholarship program.  Other than for severe hardship circumstances, such waivers have been considered in particular in cases where service has been performed by Indian health scholarship awardees in certain recruitment and training programs in academic institutions. In these cases, an individual scholarship awardee has served in a significant capacity in a program, funded by the Indian Health Service, designed to attract and retain American Indian and Alaska Native students in health professions training.  In recognition of the enormous need for such recruitment and retention activities, it has been decided in a small number of cases that such service can be substituted, in whole or in part, for direct provision of health care.  The managers emphasize that the primary purpose for the Indian health scholarship program is to increase the number of individuals providing direct health care to American Indian and Alaska Native people in areas and at facilities where access to health care is difficult or limited. Thus, service in such a capacity should remain the principal way that scholarship payback obligations are fulfilled.  However, the managers recognize the importance of stronger, more targeted, and more aggressive recruitment and retention of American Indian and Alaska Native students into health care training, and that such efforts may be enhanced by having an Indian health scholarship recipient serve in such a program.  When the major duties and responsibilities of an individual, who already has received training through an Indian health scholarship, are the recruitment and training of Indian health professionals, that individual may be contributing to the purpose of the scholarship program through increasing the number of available health care providers, even though that individual is not providing health care personally.  Thus, there may be a small number of cases where such service is a good cause to waive or offset the scholarship service obligation.  It has come to the attention of the managers that both the Indian Health Service and a number of tribal organizations have identified the need for greater flexibility in assessing payback obligations to best serve the health care needs of Indian people.  The managers emphasize, in granting this additional flexibility to the Secretary, that they expect this avenue of fulfilling scholarship obligations to be limited.  Most Indian health scholarship recipients will fulfill their service obligations by providing direct health care, and the Secretary is expected to exercise significant caution and considerable judgment is using this new authority.  It must not be forgotten that direct health care service to Indian people, in addition to successfully having completed a health professions program, is a key component contributing to any individual's ability to recruit students.  In conclusion, I note that the managers have amended the other body's amendment to delete certain language which we feel is unnecessary.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3378 is an important piece of legislation which has been amended and then reamended. It is a good bill and I urge my colleagues to give it their full support.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
