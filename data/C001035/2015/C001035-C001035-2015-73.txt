President, I just want to make a brief announcement before yielding to Senator Blunt and Senator Klobuchar, and that is that we are open for business as far as amendments are concerned.  I would invite my colleagues to start sharing their proposals with Senator Reed, with me, and with our staffs so we can see if there are some that can be cleared, and perhaps, later in the day, we can move by unanimous consent a package of those that are acceptable and noncontroversial to both sides. The sooner we can get going on the review of those amendments, the better. I would encourage my colleagues to proceed.  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.
