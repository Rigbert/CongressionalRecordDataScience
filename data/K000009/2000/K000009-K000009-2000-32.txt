Speaker, first I would like to say to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Baldacci), because he represents the Northeastern home heating reserve issue so well, he represents all States. So I want to say to the gentleman, his reach extends beyond his own State in many ways. I thank him for speaking on behalf of the motion to instruct.  Mr. Speaker, I ask our colleagues to vote for the motion to instruct.
