Mr. Chairman, the gentleman is correct. This section should not be implemented if it would significantly disrupt legitimate border traffic. I will support going forward with this section only if it will not impede that cross-border travel and trade that I understand the gentleman from Washington has a legitimate concern about.  At the same time I must emphasize that section 110 was included in the 1996 act because a comprehensive and efficient entry/exit is vital for our national security.                              {time}  2100  Without such a system, our government has no idea who is coming to the United States and whether they leave when they are supposed to do so. It is particularly important that the United States protect its citizens from terrorism, drug smuggling and illegal aliens.
