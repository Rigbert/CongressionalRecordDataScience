We clearly have a profound disagreement.  When we were in the majority, we got no help on your side, Mr. Majority Leader--you remember that, zero, one, two, three, four--on programs that we felt very strongly about. There was no opportunity to have bipartisan dialogue. There was no opportunity to have bipartisan agreement.  The gentleman refers to regular order. Very frankly, the person who talks about regular order most is your Speaker. And you talk about regular order. We ought to pass a bill, and then we ought to go and have an agreement.  Some 90 days ago, I believe, we passed a budget. At your insistence, the Senate passed a budget. Good for them. We have not gone to conference. You have not provided an opportunity to go to conference. You haven't appointed conferees. That's regular order. The gentleman wants it on one bill but apparently not all bills.  I tell my friend we want regular order. We want to go to conference. We want to undo the breaking of an agreement that we made in the Budget Control Act, which said there would be a firewall between domestic and defense. You have eliminated that firewall.  You have assumed sequester is in place. Sequester is bad for this country. You and I tend to agree on that, I think. But the fact is there's no legislation to undo that sequester--except the legislation you talked about passing in the last Congress, which is dead, gone and buried. Yes, we want regular order.  The reason the bill lost today is because 62 of your Members rejected Mr. Lucas' plea--which I thought was a very eloquent plea--in which he said: I know some of you don't think there's enough reform in this bill, and some of you think there's too much reform. But Mr. Peterson and I brought out a bill that was a bipartisan bill, supported by the majority of Democrats and the majority of--I think all Republicans, maybe, on the committee; I'm not sure of that, Mr. Leader. But the fact of the matter is it was a bipartisan bill--just as Homeland Security was a bipartisan bill--and it was turned into a partisan bill.  You respond that the Southland amendment was for reforms. That's exactly what Mr. Lucas was talking about. He was saying some people don't think we went far enough and some people think we went too far. Mr. Southerland thought we hadn't gone far enough. And 58 Republicans voted for Southerland and then turned around and voted against the bill, the very reforms you're talking about.  So don't blame Democrats for the loss today. You didn't bring up the farm bill when it was reported out on a bipartisan basis. Last year you didn't even bring it to the floor because your party couldn't come together supporting their chairman's bill.                              {time}  1420  So that's where we find ourselves, Mr. Speaker. I wasn't going to bring up that bill at all. What happened, happened.  Very frankly, when we lost on the floor, it was because we lost on the floor when we were in the majority. We produced 218 votes for almost everything we put on this floor. Don't blame Democrats for the failure to bring 218 Republicans to your bipartisan Lucas-supported and Peterson-supported piece of legislation on the floor. We believe that that loss, that partisanship on this bill, hurt farmers, hurt consumers, hurt our country.  Let's bring that bill back to the floor and have a vote on it as it was reported out on a bipartisan basis. I think it would pass. Maybe not because of your votes. That's been your problem all along.  Don't blame Democrats for the loss of that bill. Don't blame Democrats for being partisan.  We knew about those amendments, Mr. Leader, just as you knew about them. You knew we were very much opposed to some of those amendments, notwithstanding the fact all the leadership, I believe--I haven't looked at the record--voted for those amendments just as they voted for the King amendment on Homeland Security.  Yeah, you pushed my button.  I'm prepared to work in a bipartisan fashion, but I'm not prepared to work in a bipartisan fashion when it's said, This is what we agree on--meaning your side--so you better take it if we're going to have any agreement. That's not the way it works. It never worked that way in America. That's not what America is about. America is about expecting us to work together.  This bill was reported out overwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis. It could have been passed on a very large bipartisan vote, and was precluded by the actions taken through these amendments on the floor, most of which we did not support. You knew we did not--not only you. Your party knew that we did not support.  So I'm surprised when you talk to me about regular order and there's nothing--nothing--to do on the budget conference that you wanted the Senate to pass a budget. They did. You have just told me that you wanted regular order and that we should have passed the farm bill so we could work together.  You're assuming, of course, that the Senate would have gone to conference. I hope they would have, and I think they would have, because I talked to the chair. She would have wanted to go to conference, assuming we got votes on the Republican side of the aisle.  But we also wanted to go to conference in regular order on the budget to solve the stark differences between the two parties. That's the only way you are going to get from where we are to where you need to be, by having a conference and trying to come to an agreement.  My own premise is, Mr. Leader, that you don't have a conference because there is nothing to which Patty Murray could agree, that Mr. Ryan could agree, that he could bring back to your caucus and get a majority of votes for, because they are for what you passed and nothing more than that. We are $91 billion apart. If we divide it in two and just said, ``Okay, we'll split the difference,'' you couldn't pass it on your side of the aisle, and I think you know that.  I don't know that I have any more questions that would be particularly useful, but I yield to my friend.
