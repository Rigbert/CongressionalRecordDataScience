DORGAN. Let me say this about the unanimous consent request. If you take a look at all the arms control treaties that have been offered to the Senate--the ABM Treaty, the START I treaty, the START II treaty, on down the line--and take a look at how many days of comprehensive hearings they had, No. 1, in the committee of jurisdiction and, No. 2, how many days they were debated on the floor of the Senate, what the Senator will discover is this treaty, that has been treated lightly, it is a serious matter--treated lightly by the fact that the majority leader said, even without comprehensive hearings, we will bring this treaty to the floor of the Senate and kill it.  It alone is the arms control treaty that has been treated in this manner. All other treaties were dealt with seriously with long, thoughtful, comprehensive hearings--day, after day, after day--and then a debate on the floor of the Senate--day after day--which involved the American people and public opinion; and then this country made decisions about those treaties.  I know there are some who have never supported an arms control treaty under any condition. They have not.
