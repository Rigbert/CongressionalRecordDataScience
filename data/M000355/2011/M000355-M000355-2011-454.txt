 President, only in Washington could you argue with a straight face that starting a new multitrillion-dollar entitlement program is going to save money. CBO could only look at the proposition that was presented to it, which frontloads tax increases in Medicare cuts and backloads benefits.  Therefore, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and section 4(G)(3) of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, I move to waive all applicable sections of those acts and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of my amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.
