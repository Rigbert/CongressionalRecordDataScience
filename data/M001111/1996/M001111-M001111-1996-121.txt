 President, let me associate my remarks with my colleague from Illinois, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun. I am delighted that I had the opportunity to be on the floor to hear the very, very important words that the Senator from Illinois has shared with all of us today about this extremely important issue.  I am delighted that the citizens of Illinois had the intelligence to send her here so that she could be a leader and a voice that all of us could follow. I am delighted to support the Senator with the resolution, and I am delighted to stand shoulder to shoulder as we pursue this very, very important issue in this country and put to rest the racism that we see.
