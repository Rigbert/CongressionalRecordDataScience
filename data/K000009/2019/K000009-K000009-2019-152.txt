 Mayor Adamowicz had served his city since 1998 as it championed the values of liberty, equality, and democracy. I hold profound respect for his enduring dedication, perseverance, and honorable service to his community and nation. He loved Gdansk as a beacon for a free Poland and gave his life to it.  What a deep tragedy this is for his grieving family, his wife, his children, his associates, for the Polish nation, and for freedom-loving people everywhere.  Far too much blood has been shed on Polish soil for the world to ignore such a heinous crime that took his life.  I visited Gdansk in both 2009 and 2013, and through these visits, I gained an even deeper respect for its noble history and its place on Earth, including the location where Nazi shelling at Westerplatte began the cataclysmic invasion of Poland starting World War II.This year, we will commemorate the 80th anniversary of that moment.  Then more recently, Gdansk's redemptive transformative role in world history with the courageous Solidarnosc worker strikes that trip-wired the collapse of tyranny across Central Europe, imposed by the Soviet Union, ushering in the possibility of freedom for the millions who suffered under dehumanizing repression for over half a century.  In our modern era, Gdansk became that symbol of liberty. It formally partnered with the city of Cleveland, Ohio, which I am privileged to represent, along with Congresswoman Marcia Fudge, in a sister-cities relationship. As part of my own congressional district, I am deeply honored and proud of this relationship.  In Mayor Adamowicz's memory, I and this Congress must stand ready to strengthen this alliance of liberty, certainly at this moment in history. In his memory, our Poland Caucus must pursue an annual liberty exchange in his name to nurture aspiring young Polish leaders who follow in his footsteps in pursuit of liberty and security for Poland.  Let his death serve as a constant reminder of how precious freedom remains. I am certain Polish law enforcement officials will examine the circumstances surrounding the perpetrator's actions with a diligent eye. They must ascertain whether there are any linkages that exist with outside influence or propaganda that might have catalyzed this heinous crime.  I know I speak on behalf of all Americans and of millions of Polish Americans across our country, including in Ohio, to remind all freedom-loving people that the United States stands with Poland now at this hour of mourning.  During these uncertain times, we must work to strengthen our transatlantic and NATO alliances through increased diplomatic, cultural, and military exchanges.  May the soul of Mayor Pawel Adamowicz rest in peace, and may the worth of his noble life inspire the young leaders of Poland to pursue his visionary leadership.                          ____________________
