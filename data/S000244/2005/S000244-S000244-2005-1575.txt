Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 50th Anniversary of the Village of Brown Deer, WI. It gives me great pleasure to join Brown Deer in celebrating this historic occasion.  Brown Deer was not incorporated into a village until January 20, 1955. However, its history began much earlier in 1835, when Irish and German migrants from the eastern United States settled in the Brown Deer-Granville area in search of farm lands. A few men from Granville, New York gave the township its name, which means ``large city.'' In 1841, the original towns of Lake and Milwaukee were parceled out into seven townships of roughly 36 square miles apiece. The township of Granville was positioned in the northwest corner of Milwaukee County. It was in the northeast corner of this township where a small community referred to by residents as Brown Deer developed.  With a population of about 225, the first town meeting took place in 1842. The early 1900s showed moderate population growth in the Brown Deer area, but it was not until September 1953 that the process of incorporating Brown Deer into a village began. On November 3, 1953, incorporators applied for an order incorporating the Village with the Circuit Court of Milwaukee County. Following a hearing and a subsequent trial, the people of Brown Deer voted overwhelmingly at a referendum ordered by the Circuit Court in favor of incorporation, thereby officially creating the Village of Brown Deer and making it a municipal corporation on January 20, 1955.  Its humble beginnings helped make Brown Deer the Village it is today. I congratulate the Village of Brown Deer on its incorporation, and wish the residents of the Village of Brown Deer a very happy 50th Anniversary.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E120]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]           50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE VILLAGE OF BROWN DEER, WI                                 ______                                                     HON.
