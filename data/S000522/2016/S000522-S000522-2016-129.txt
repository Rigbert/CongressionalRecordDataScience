Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the National Association of Private Special Education Centers (NAPSEC) for their 45 years of excellent service and academic dedication to our country's individuals with disabilities. NAPSEC's educational therapeutic services, combined with over four decades of experience, are invaluable to the education community across the United States and to the many partners in my home state of New Jersey.   Established in 1971, NAPSEC represents private specialized education programs including early intervention services, school programs, residential therapeutic centers, and college experience and adult living programs for individuals with disabilities and their families. The majority of NAPSEC's member programs provide services to publicly placed students with disabilities through the Continuum of Alternative Placements and Services required by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Originally enacted into law in 1975, IDEA is the primary federal statute governing special education for children from birth through age 21 and guaranteeing the rights of children with disabilities to a free public education that suits their needs.   Nationwide, 6.6 million students with disabilities are ensured of and receive an education because of IDEA. While many of these children are successfully integrated into public schools and typical classrooms, IDEA requires that a variety of options are available to meet the individual needs of disabled students. Of these students, 3.4 percent are served in private specialized day and/or residential programs. NAPSEC member programs meet a vital need for individuals who are not able to thrive in a typical classroom environment, acknowledging each individual's unique experience, because every child has the right to an education that empowers them to succeed.   NAPSEC's hundreds of affiliates bridge the gap and offer much needed services to publically and privately placed individuals. In addition to K-12 education, these services also include early intervention services for infants and toddlers. As co-chair of the Coalition on Autism Research and Education (CARE), I've seen firsthand the impact that early intervention makes in successful outcomes for children and applaud this attention to early intervention.   Additionally, NAPSEC programs provide postsecondary college experience and adult living programs that serve individuals who have aged out of their school based supports and are no longer eligible for services under IDEA. As 50,000 individuals with autism, and many more with other disabilities, age out of their education based supports every year, supports and services for these individuals are critically necessary in ensuring that young adults with disabilities can successfully transition into the next phase of their lives. Their services needs do not end when they turn 21.   NAPSEC programs improve educational outcomes for people with disabilities and empower them to achieve their full potential and make meaningful contributions to society. When individuals with disabilities are empowered to achieve, we all benefit.   I remain impressed by the quality of care and expertise NAPSEC's partners provide to America's students with disabilities, including those with autism. Again, I offer NAPSEC my sincerest congratulations and gratitude for their 45 years of service to the disabilities community and look forward to NAPSEC's continued progress in the future.                          ____________________
