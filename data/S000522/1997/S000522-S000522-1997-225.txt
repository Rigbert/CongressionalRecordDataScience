Mr. Speaker, when large companies merge or downsize, it is often the older workers and long-time employees that bear the brunt of the job insecurity and downsizing that follows. When the corporate cost-cutters start scouring each department for cost savings, the most experienced workers often feel as though they have a bulls eye on their chest.  While every lay-off is a painful and unpleasant experience, older workers often find themselves in a unique ``catch-22'' situation: they are to young to comfortably retire, and too old for most companies to retrain. Many firms are understandably hesitant to retrain displaced older workers because the company may fear it will not be able to recoup their investment before the worker retires.  Yet clearly, in this global economy, displaced older workers in labor-intensive and ``smokestack'' industries negatively affected by trade agreements need to be retrained for jobs in other economic sectors. For example, when layoffs are concentrated in a particular industry, such as the defense industry, displaced older workers with specialized skills and knowledge have a difficult time finding comparable employment without retraining because the demand for their existing skills is low.  Mr. Speaker, data I have obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics [BLS] confirms what most Americans already know--older, displaced workers face very difficult challenges when seeking new employment.  For instance, in comparison with younger workers, older workers, those age 50 and above, have a higher unemployment rate--17 percent versus 12 percent--drop out of the labor force at higher rates after a lay-off--39 percent vs. 10 percent--suffer a longer period of unemployment between jobs--27.3 median weeks vs. 11.6 median weeks--and on average, take a 29.6 percent pay-cut in their median weekly earnings after they do finally secure a new job.  The current Tax Code compounds the problem by including severance payments made in connection with a lay-off or work force reduction as taxable income, even though this income is nonrecurring. This makes a displaced worker look suddenly wealthy on paper, pushing their family into a higher tax bracket. As a result, the current Tax Code actually taxes the severance payments of the most senior workers in a firm at the highest marginal rate, since the value of a severance package is usually derived from one's length of service to the firm.  Here is where the Tax Code is at its most heartless to displaced older workers, since those having the most difficult time finding another job are simultaneously being hit with the highest taxes on the severance payments they receive.  Mr. Speaker, to remedy this unfairness, and to provide a measure of assistance for older workers facing a particularly difficult situation, I am introducing the Career Transition Assistance Act of 1997, which will provide much needed tax relief in two critical areas.  First, my bill will allow employees who are offered severance pay packages by their employers to exclude the first $15,000 from their taxable income. No longer will the Tax Code punish displaced workers by taxing their misfortune. This income exclusion could be taken by the employee regardless of whether the reduction in force was voluntary or involuntary  In addition, if an employer's severance benefit provides for payments for up to 3 years from the date of separation, my legislation would allow the employee the flexibility to elect to exclude all or some of the severance payment from their income for the 3 year period, up to the $15,000 limit.  Second, the legislation will provide a $2,000 refundable tax credit for retraining expenses incurred after a lay-off. This tax credit is in keeping with the common-sense principle that families and individuals know their retraining needs better than government-run retraining programs.  To ensure that this tax relief is available to middle class families, jointly filing couples with incomes of up to $100,000, and single persons with incomes up to $75,000, would qualify under my legislation for the full $2,000 tax credit. The value of the credit is gradually phased out for persons earning higher amounts.  While I believe Congress should continue to reform and reduce red-tape in our Nation's patch-work of retraining programs, it is important to protect workers from slipping through the cracks of these programs' widely varying eligibility criteria.  This legislation will go a long way toward improving the efficiency of our Nation's labor markets, and I call on Members on both sides of the aisle to lend their support for this effort. Severance payments are designed to provide a financial cushion to help pad the blow of a work force reduction. When the Tax Code adds insult to injury by subjecting these families to a higher tax liability, it is clearly time to correct this insidious consequence.                          ____________________
