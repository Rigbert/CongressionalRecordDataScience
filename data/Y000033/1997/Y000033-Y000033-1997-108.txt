Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2233, the Coral Reef Conservation Act, a bill introduced by our colleagues Jim Saxton and Neil Abercrombie.  While there may be only a few scattered corals in Alaska, coral reefs represent a new frontier source for medicines and lifesaving products. In addition, they provide natural protection for coastlines from high waves, storm surges, coastal erosion, and accompanying threats to human life and property.  Furthermore, coral reefs are particularly important in generating tourism, and they contain some of the world's most productive marine habitats. These reefs make a real contribution to the economies where they are located.  This bill is a positive effort to protect our Nation's coral reefs, and I am confident that the Department of Commerce will effectively manage the Coral Reef Conservation Fund.
