Chairman, I rise in opposition to this bill, and I am proud to be a Democrat today.  Mr. Chairman, I would love to run against any Member of this Chamber who votes to eliminate the summer jobs for our teenage sons and daughters. I would be proud to run against any Member who votes to eliminate the winter heating program that helps people like Sadie in my district, a women who is 73 years old, worked all her life at a laundry, raised a family, and now survives by picking up odd jobs at age 72.  I would love to run against any Member who votes to eliminate this program today for the hundreds of thousand of seniors across our country who depend on this program, and then to take those savings and save them up for a tax cut for the wealthiest people in our society, rather than raising the money by closing tax loopholes that let billions of dollars go out the back door by letting our pharmaceutical companies manufacture abroad, or not close the transfer pricing loophole that lets foreign companies do business in this country and not pay their bills.  Mr. Chairman, I would love to run against anybody that votes to eliminate summer jobs and this winter heating program.
