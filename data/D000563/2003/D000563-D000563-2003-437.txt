President, I wish to offer praise of Charles ental holdings1Total= 000>E. ``Chuck'' Frank of Chicago, IL, for his ongoing efforts to improve ental holdings1Total= 000>our environment. Mr. Frank's stance on environmental issues deserves ental holdings1Total= 000>particular commendation because in addition to being an active ental holdings1Total= 000>supporter of the environment, he is in the business of selling cars and ental holdings1Total= 000>trucks at one of the Chicago area's largest car dealerships, which was ental holdings1Total= 000>founded by his legendary father, ``Z'' Frank.ental holdings1Total= 000>  Mr. Frank's love for the outdoors started in the early years of his ental holdings1Total= 000>life when he spent hours camping, fishing, and pursuing other ental holdings1Total= 000>activities immersed in nature. His love and respect for the environment ental holdings1Total= 000>did not stop with childhood. Mr. Frank has made a personal and ental holdings1Total= 000>professional commitment to protect the environment that he so loved to ental holdings1Total= 000>ensure that future generations will be able to experience the same ental holdings1Total= 000>natural wonders that he was able to. This commitment led Mr. Frank to ental holdings1Total= 000>join the Sierra Club in 1975, and now he is a lifetime member and Vice ental holdings1Total= 000>President of the Sierra Club Foundation.ental holdings1Total= 000>  Mr. Frank has demonstrated his commitment to the environment he loves ental holdings1Total= 000>by working with the Sierra Club to secure a significant increase in the ental holdings1Total= 000>Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards. Offering a unique perspective ental holdings1Total= 000>from inside the automobile industry, he believes the current CAFE ental holdings1Total= 000>standards of 27.5 miles per gallon for cars and 20.7 miles per gallon ental holdings1Total= 000>for trucks are standards the fail to meet consumers' demands both for ental holdings1Total= 000>more cost-effective vehicles and solutions to the worsening problems of ental holdings1Total= 000>air pollution and global warming. He believes the technology in his ental holdings1Total= 000>industry can surpass the current standards, and believes that an ental holdings1Total= 000>increase to 40 miles per gallon for cars and 27.5 miles per gallon for ental holdings1Total= 000>trucks is entirely possible. Mr. Frank strongly advocates increasing ental holdings1Total= 000>the CAFE standards to these proposed levels to ensure stronger customer ental holdings1Total= 000>satisfaction and improved environmental conditions.ental holdings1Total= 000>  Mr. Frank has termed his business, ``The Country's #1 Conscientious ental holdings1Total= 000>Chevy Dealer,'' In Mr. Frank's case, this slogan goes beyond simple ental holdings1Total= 000>rhetoric and is absolutely true of his approach to his business. Mr. ental holdings1Total= 000>Frank believes so strongly in the need for an increase in the CAFE that ental holdings1Total= 000>he has pledged part of his business profits to the Sierra Club Clean ental holdings1Total= 000>Air Campaign. He is currently running advertisements in the Chicago ental holdings1Total= 000>area that detail the need for a raise in the CAFE standards and offer ental holdings1Total= 000>consumers an opportunity to have Mr. Frank's car dealership donate $200 ental holdings1Total= 000>to the Sierra Club for each car or truck sold. I commend Mr. Frank for ental holdings1Total= 000>demonstrating that issues that affect our Nation's public health and ental holdings1Total= 000>environment are just as important as the bottom line.ental holdings1Total= 000>  The tireless work that Chuck Frank has done as a champion of the ental holdings1Total= 000>environment and as a manager in the automobile industry should be an ental holdings1Total= 000>inspiration for us all to enact legislation to raise the CAFE ental holdings1Total= 000>standards. Mr. Frank's unique position demonstrates that business and ental holdings1Total= 000>environmental issues can go hand-in-hand. I thank Chuck Frank for his ental holdings1Total= 000>unwavering support for consumers of this country and the environment, ental holdings1Total= 000>and I am confident that his work will help move us toward the increase ental holdings1Total= 000>in CAFE standards that is so needed in this country.ental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>                          ____________________ental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>
