Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, before I yield back, I want to again thank all of my colleagues and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Rodriguez), especially, for his leadership on this bill. The gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Moran), who spoke earlier, held the really landmark hearings that helped catapult this issue into the forefront in people's thought.  Let us not forget what we are talking about. The Department of Defense in some 41 tests aboard ships used agents like anthrax, VX, sarin gas. Yes, they used simulants in many cases, but they actually used the real deal. They actually used real contaminants.  We are not sure, even to this day, whether or not the protective suits that were worn by our sailors aboard those ships actually protected them from these very caustic and poisonous agents.  We need to get to the bottom of it. I am convinced, having been at the hearings, having had several conversations with people at the DOD and the VA, that they are really going to go all out to make sure that every veteran who is malaffected or could have been malaffected by this gets the kind of health care and compensation that is necessary if, indeed, they have been contaminated by it.  So this is a very important bill. I hope that the full body will embrace it.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
