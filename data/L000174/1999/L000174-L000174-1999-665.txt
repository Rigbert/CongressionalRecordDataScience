President, the Hatch-Leahy amendment is a good one. I hope everybody will support it. I have talked for years about empowering users of the Internet to control and limit access to material they did not want to see and that could be found on line. This could be any type of material. Parents may not want their children buying things. There may be obscene material. It could be types of sites parents are against.  We also know there is a lot of amazing and wonderful material on the Internet. While I oppose efforts in Congress to regulate content of the Internet, I do want to make sure children can be protected, that parents have the ability to do that, and this gives them a chance to do it.  I have always believed the power to control what people see belongs to theusers and the parents, not the Government. The amendment the chairman and I offer requires large on-line service providers to offer their subscribers filtering software and systems to stop objectionable materials from reaching their computer screens. I am supportive of voluntary industry efforts to come together and provide Internet users with one-click-away information resources on how to protect children when they go on line. Senator Campbell and I joined Vice President Gore at the White House last week to hear about this one-click-away amendment. Our amendment helps promote the use of filtering technologies. It is better than Government censorship. It is a fall-back provision, if the companies do not do it themselves.                          ____________________
