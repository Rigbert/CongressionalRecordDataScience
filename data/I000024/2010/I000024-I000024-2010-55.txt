President, I would like to take a few minutes today to speak about the importance of oversight.  As you may recall, on April 22, 2010, EPA's new lead-based paint, the lead, renovation, repair and painting rule, went into effect. At that time, offices on the Hill were inundated with intense public outcry from constituents--from homeowners to contractors to landlords to plumbers--all trying to get more information about a rule that, in most cases, they had just learned about. People were confused about the implications of the rule.  This rule affects anyone who owns or lives in a home built before 1978 and looking to do a renovation. Specifically, the rule requires that renovations in these homes that disturb more than six square feet must be supervised by a certified renovator and conducted by a certified renovation firm. In order to become certified, contractors must submit an application--with a fee--to EPA, and complete a training course for instruction on lead-safe work practices. Those who violate the rule could face a fine of $37,500 a day.  In my role as ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, prior to implementation, I sent several letters to EPA expressing concern with the rate of training. I wrote on two separate occasions warning EPA that it seemed badly unprepared to properly implement the rule. In both cases, EPA said they were ready.  In a June 3, 2009 letter responding to my concerns, EPA wrote:       I agree that both EPA and the regulated community have a      great deal of preparation in front of us as we approach next      April's deadline. I am confident, however, that the ten      months between now and April 2010 will allow us to meet this      deadline....We are confident that all renovators subject to      the requirements of the rule will be able to find a provider      in advance of our deadline.  In a letter dated December 1, 2009, EPA wrote:       we are confident there will be enough training providers to      meet the demand. EPA does not plan to revise the April 2010      effective date of the RRP rule....Currently, the capacity for      training is in excess of the demand as several training      courses have been cancelled for lack of attendance.  On implementation day, April 22, 2010, EPA had only accredited 204 training providers who had conducted just over 6,900 courses, training an estimated 160,000 people in the construction and remodeling industries to use lead-safe work practices. That number fell far short of the total number of remodelers who would be working on pre-1978 homes.  Let me say it again: on implementation day, EPA had only trained an estimated 160,000 people in the construction and remodeling industries to use lead-safe work practices.  I suspected that there wouldn't be enough contractors to even meet EPA's estimate of certifying 186,811 renovators by April 2010. So I sent a bipartisan letter to OMB requesting that they delay implementation of the rule until there was enough time for more people to be certified. Additionally, I spoke to Cass Sunstein, Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs at OMB, and was joined by some of my Oklahoma contractors, who relayed the difficulties they were facing. I appreciate Mr. Sunstein listening to the concerns of my Oklahoma constituents. He told us he recognized the economic impact of the implementation of the rule and explored ways to provide a 60-day delay, but, by April 23, we simply ran out of options.  The rule was in place, there were not enough renovators, and EPA argued that a delay in the rule would delayprotection for children and their families. But because the Federal Government failed to meet the demand for certified contractors, the Federal Government was already delaying the implementation of the rule.  I was proud that the Senate intervened to send a clear message to EPA. The Senate passed the Collins-Inhofe amendment, S. 4253, to the supplemental appropriations bill, H.R. 4899, by a vote of 60 to 37.  This amendment prevented supplemental funds from being used to implement the rule. The vote showed overwhelming bipartisan concern about EPA's disastrous implementation of the lead-based paint rule.  Fortunately, EPA got the message. On June 18, 2010, EPA's enforcement office issued a memorandum extending the lead rule deadline for renovators to enroll in training classes to September 30, 2010. Furthermore, it has extended the deadline for contractors to complete training to December 31, 2010, and most importantly, the agency agreed to work to provide additional trainers in areas of need.  EPA's concerns about extending additional time for renovators to become certified never materialized; in fact, instead of people continuing to delay signing up for classes, people flocked to them. EPA's most recent training numbers show that as of September 23, 2010, EPA has accredited 364 training providers who have conducted more than 21,400 courses, training an estimated 476,700 people in the construction and remodeling industries to use lead-safe work practices.  From just 160,000 people in April, to 476,700 people in September, more time has meant greater ability to take classes and come into compliance.  The delay has allowed another 160 training providers to be certified; an additional 14,500 courses to be held; and 316,700 people to receive training in lead safe work practices.  Unfortunately, we did not have one oversight hearing on this rule. There were numerous opportunities prior to the rule going final, but they were never taken. Nonetheless, I am pleased to have worked with Senators Collins, Alexander, Vitter, Coburn and others to highlight this important issue and provide additional time for renovators to attend training classes.                          ____________________
