 President, I rise today with Senators Kennedy and DeWine in support of legislation to empower the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, to regulate tobacco products.  During my time in the Senate, I have become very involved with cancer. I am the Co-Chair of the Senate Cancer Caucus and the Vice-Chair of the National Dialogue on Cancer, which is Chaired by former President and Barbara Bush.  The cancer community is united in the belief that the single most important preventive measure is to place tobacco products under the regulatory control of the FDA. I stand behind the cancer community and express the same belief.  Smoking causes one-third of all cancers, and is the cause of approximately 165,000 deaths annually.  I firmly believe that cancer cannot be conquered without addressing smoking and the use of tobacco products.  Smoking results in death or disability for over half of tobacco users, according to the Centers for Disease Control, CDC. Smoking costs the health care system over $70 billion annually.  Over the past two decades, we have learned that tobacco companies have manipulated the level of nicotine in cigarettes to increase the number of people addicted to their product.  There are more than 40 chemicals in tobacco smoke that cause cancer in humans and animals, according to the CDC. Tobacco smoke has toxic components, as well as tar, carbon monoxide and other dangerous additives.  It is long past time to reduce the addictive nature of cigarettes and curtail the marketing of these products to young people. I believe that empowering the FDA to regulate tobacco will help do that.  The U.S. Surgeon General and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have unequivocally demonstrated that, for example, anti-smoking campaigns can reduce smoking, a major cause of cancer.  California is a good example: My state started an aggressive tobacco control program in 1989 and throughout the 1990s, tobacco use dropped at two to three times faster than the rest of the country.  Ninety percent of adult smokers begin before age 18 and every day, 3,000 young people become smokers.  This bill will provide meaningful regulation by the Food and Drug Administration of the content and marketing of tobacco products, especially the addicting and carcinogenic components.  Dr. C. Everett Koop, former US Surgeon General, and Dr. David Kessler, former Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, in 1997 report, cited FDA and other studies and said:       Nicotine in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco has the same      pharmacological effects as other drugs that FDA has      traditionally regulated . . . nicotine is extremely addictive      . . . and the vast majority of people who use nicotine-     containing cigarettes and smokeless tobacco do so to satisfy      their craving for the pharmacological effects of nicotine;      that is, to satisfy their drug-dependence or addiction.  They go to recommend that the ``FDA should continue to have authority to regulate all areas of nicotine, as well as other constituents and ingredients, and that authority should be made completely explicit.''  I am pleased that to note that even the Philip Morris Companies has acknowledged the need for FDA to regulate tobacco. On their website, they say:       We believe federal legislation that includes granting FDA      authority to regulate tobacco products could effectively      address many of the complex tobacco issues that concern the      public, the public health community and us.  It is long past time to reduce the addictive nature of cigarettes and curtail the marketing of these products to young people. This bill gives FDA the power to regulate tobacco products' content, design, sale, and marketing.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2626       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

The Congress finds the following:       (1) The use of tobacco products by the Nation's children is      a pediatric disease of epic and worsening proportions that      results in new generations of tobacco-dependent children and      adults.       (2) A consensus exists within the scientific and medical      communities that tobacco products are inherently dangerous      and cause cancer, heart disease, and other serious adverse      health effects.       (3) Nicotine is an addictive drug.       (4) Virtually all new users of tobacco products are under      the minimum legal age to purchase such products.       (5) Tobacco advertising and marketing contribute      significantly to the use of nicotine-containing tobacco      products by adolescents.       (6) Because past efforts to restrict advertising and      marketing of tobacco products have failed adequately to curb      tobacco use     by adolescents, comprehensive restrictions on the sale,      promotion, and distribution of such products are needed.       (7) Federal and State governments have lacked the legal and      regulatory authority and resources they need to address      comprehensively the public health and societal problems      caused by the use of tobacco products.       (8) Federal and State public health officials, the public      health community, and the public at large recognize that the      tobacco industry should be subject to ongoing oversight.       (9) Under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, the      Congress is vested with the responsibility for regulating      interstate commerce and commerce with Indian tribes.       (10) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and      use of tobacco products are activities in and substantially      affecting interstate commerce because they are sold,      marketed, advertised, and distributed in interstate commerce      on a nationwide basis, and have a substantial effect on the      Nation's economy.       (11) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and      use of such products substantially affect interstate commerce      through the health care and other costs attributable to the      use of tobacco products.       (12) It is in the public interest for Congress to enact      legislation that provides the Food and Drug Administration      with the authority to regulate tobacco products. The benefits      to the American people from enacting such legislation would      be significant in human and economic terms.       (13) Tobacco use is the foremost preventable cause of      premature death in America. It causes over 400,000 deaths in      the United States each year.       (14) Reducing the use of tobacco by minors by 50 percent      would prevent well over 10,000,000 of today's children from      becoming regular, daily smokers, saving over 3,000,000 of      them from premature death due to tobacco induced disease.      Such a reduction in youth smoking would also result in      approximately $110,000,000,000 in savings attributable to      reduced health care costs.       (15) Advertising, marketing, and promotion of tobacco      products have been especially directed to attract young      persons to use tobacco products and these efforts have      resulted in increased use of such products by youth. Past      efforts to oversee these activities have not been successful      in adequately preventing such increased use.       (16) In 1999, the tobacco industry spent close to      $8,240,000,000 to attract new users, retain current users,      increase current consumption, and generate favorable long-     term attitudes toward smoking and tobacco use.       (17) Tobacco product advertising often misleadingly      portrays the use of tobacco as socially acceptable and      healthful to minors.       (18) Tobacco product advertising is regularly seen by      persons under the age of 18, and persons under the age of 18      are regularly exposed to tobacco product promotional efforts.       (19) Through advertisements during and sponsorship of      sporting events, tobacco has become strongly associated with      sports and has become portrayed as an integral part of sports      and the healthy lifestyle associated with rigorous sporting      activity.       (20) Children are exposed to substantial and unavoidable      tobacco advertising that leads to favorable beliefs about      tobacco use, plays a role in leading young people to      overestimate the prevalence of tobacco use, and increases the      number of young people who begin to use tobacco.       (21) The use of tobacco products in motion pictures and      other mass media glamorizes its use for young people and      encourages them to use tobacco products.       (22) Tobacco advertising expands the size of the tobacco      market by increasing consumption of tobacco products      including tobacco use by young people.       (23) Children are more influenced by tobacco advertising      than adults, they smoke the most advertised brands, and      children as young as 3 to 6 years old can recognize a      character associated with smoking at the same rate as they      recognize cartoons and fast food characters.       (24) Tobacco company documents indicate that young people      are an important and often crucial segment of the tobacco      market.       (25) Comprehensive advertising restrictions will have a      positive effect on the smoking rates of young people.       (26) Restrictions on advertising are necessary to prevent      unrestricted tobacco advertising from undermining legislation      prohibiting access to young people and providing for      education about tobacco use.       (27) International experience shows that advertising      regulations that are stringent and comprehensive have a      greater impact on overall tobacco use and young people's use      than weaker or less comprehensive ones.       (28) Text-only requirements, while not as stringent as a      ban, will help reduce underage use of tobacco products while      preserving the informational function of advertising.       (29) It is in the public interest for Congress to adopt      legislation to address the public health crisis created by      actions of the tobacco industry.       (30) The final regulations promulgated by the Secretary of      Health and Human Services in the August 28, 1996, issue of      the Federal Register (62 Fed. Reg. 44615-44618) for inclusion      as part 897 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, are      consistent with the standards set forth in the amendments      made by this Act for the regulation of tobacco products by      the Food and Drug Administration and the restriction on the      sale and distribution, including access to and the      advertising and promotion of, tobacco products contained in      such regulations are substantially related to accomplishing      the public health goals of this Act.       (31) The regulations described in paragraph (30) will      directly and materially advance the Federal Government's      substantial interest in reducing the number of children and      adolescents who use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco and in      preventing the life-threatening health consequences      associated with tobacco use. An overwhelming majority of      Americans who use tobacco products begin using such products      while they are minors and become addicted to the nicotine in      those product before reaching the age of 18. Tobacco      advertising and promotion plays a crucial role in the      decision of these minors to begin using tobacco products.      Less restrictive and less comprehensive approaches have not      and will not be effective in reducing the problems addressed      by such regulations. The reasonable restrictions on the      advertising and promotion of tobacco products contained in      such regulations will lead to a significant decrease in the      number of minors using and becoming addicted to those      products.       (32) The regulations described in paragraph (30) impose no      more extensive restrictions on communication by tobacco      manufacturers and sellers than are necessary to reduce the      number of children and adolescents who use cigarettes and      smokeless tobacco and to prevent the life-threatening health      consequences associated with tobacco use. Such regulations      are narrowly tailored to restrict those advertising and      promotional practices which are most likely to be seen or      heard by youth and most likely to entice them into tobacco      use, while affording tobacco manufacturers and sellers ample      opportunity to convey information about their products to      adult consumers.     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.       The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to provide authority to the Food and Drug      Administration to regulate tobacco products under the Federal      Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), by      recognizing it as the primary Federal regulatory authority      with respect to the manufacture, marketing, and distribution      of tobacco products;       (2) to ensure that the Food and Drug Administration has the      authority to address issues of particular concern to public      health officials, especially the use of tobacco by young      people and dependence on tobacco;       (3) to authorize the Food and Drug Administration to set      national standards controlling the manufacture of tobacco      products and the identity, public disclosure, and amount of      ingredients used in such products;       (4) to provide new and flexible enforcement authority to      ensure that there is effective oversight of the tobacco      industry's efforts to develop and introduce less harmful      tobacco products;       (5) to vest the Food and Drug Administration with the      authority to regulate the levels of tar, nicotine, and other      harmful components of tobacco products;       (6) in order to ensure that adults are better informed, to      require tobacco product manufacturers to disclose research      which has not previously been made available, as well as      research generated in the future, relating to the health and      dependency effects or safety of tobacco products;       (7) to continue to permit the sale of tobacco products to      adults in conjunction with measures to ensure that they are      not sold or accessible to underage purchasers; and       (8) to impose appropriate regulatory controls on the      tobacco industry     SEC. 4. SCOPE AND EFFECT.       (a) Intended Effect.--Nothing in this Act (or an amendment      made by this Act) shall be construed to--       (1) establish a precedent with regard to any other      industry, situation, circumstance, or legal action; or       (2) affect any action pending in State, Tribal, or Federal      court, or any agreement, consent decree, or contract of any      kind.       (b) Agricultural Activities.--The provisions of this Act      (or an amendment made by this Act) which authorize the      Secretary to take certain actions with regard to tobacco and      tobacco products shall not be construed to affect any      authority of the Secretary of Agriculture under existing law      regarding the growing, cultivation, or curing of raw tobacco.
