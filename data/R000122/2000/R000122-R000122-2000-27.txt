 Bill Gray, as many know, is a former distinguished Congressman from Philadelphia, PA. He is now President of the College Fund, which was formerly known as the United Negro College Fund.  He points out in his letter the long association between the United States and Liberia and urges that we act quickly and decisively to pass this legislation.  The letter from the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service also makes that same plea for prompt and sympathetic action on this legislation. It is signed also on behalf of numerous organizations: the Catholic Charities Immigration Legal Services Program; the Episcopal Migration Ministries; the National Ministries of American Baptist Churches USA; the Lutheran Social Services of Minnesota; the Union of American Hebrew Congregations; the United Methodist Church, General Board of Church and Society; and it goes on and on.  Again, this is the heartfelt plea by the church community and the religious community in general of this country for a favorable and immediate response to the plight of these Liberians who are here with us.                          ____________________
