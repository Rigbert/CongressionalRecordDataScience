 I am concerned, however, that it may not be practical for States with existing advisory councils to reconfigure their membership to reflect all of the individuals mentioned in the Head Start bill. In my home State of Washington, we are leading the way on early childhood coordination and reform with the establishment in 2005 of Governor Gregoire's cabinet-level Department of Early Learning and the Early Learning Council, which became the Early Learning Advisory Council. The council is working hard to make sure early learning programs in my State are aligned and are providing high quality services. However, I want to make sure that the council is not unduly burdened for being a leader, and that it will not have to reconstitute its membership. I ask the chairman for his commitment to work with me as this bill is considered in conference with the House, to further resolve this issue.
