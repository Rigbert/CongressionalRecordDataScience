Is it not the right of Senators to raise questions on the floor about Miguel Estrada? Why is that unfair while the treatment of Enrique Moreno was fair? He did not even have a hearing. Miguel Estrada had a hearing, an opportunity to answer questions, and he refused to answer the questions. How is this fair to Enrique Moreno and unfair to Miguel Estrada?
