First, air pollution doesn't hurt, so don't be worried if there is more of it. And what we have is medical evidence and testimony from the experts he is wrong. I don't know if he presented any doctors--I would love to know--who support that position, that air pollution doesn't cause problems. We know it does. It stands to reason it does. Medical and human experience tells us.  The second argument that he is making, if you can get past the first, is this is how we are going to create jobs in America. On 168 separate occasions, the Republican-led House of Representatives has sought to repeal those environmental protections of our air and the safety of the water we drink, and they have bragged about it, saying when we get rid of all of these standards on air and water pollution, more Americans will go to work.  I wish to ask the Senator from California to respond, because the way I see it, if the Paul resolution passes, sadly, the people who will go to work are those who work in emergency rooms, those who work to make nebulizers for those suffering from asthma, and people who make oxygen tanks. I am sorry to say this but that is the reality. If you ignore the health consequences, the jobs created will be to treat those who are going to be afflicted by pulmonary disease because of this eradication of a standard.  I wish to ask the Senator from California, talk to me about job creation and pollution.
