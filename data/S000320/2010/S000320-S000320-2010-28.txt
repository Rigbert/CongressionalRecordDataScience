 President, I will be brief. I commend both the Senator from Delaware and the Senator from Tennessee for their hard work in this area. This is very arcane. It is difficult, but it is very important. I was hoping we could bake a whole loaf of bread, not a half. One-half is better than nothing--but a whole loaf. What we are doing thus far is Main Street. We are not worried about Wall Street. Wall Street will take care of themselves, as Senator Corker and others have said on this floor. They always have, always will. But it is Main Street, the smaller banks in our communities, in our towns all across the country. If we could, in the wisdom of the chairman of the committee, if we could move to a whole loaf of bread, that would be commendable. I feel like we are not going to do a whole loaf here today because we don't have the votes. But gosh, a whole loaf is always better than half.  I yield the floor.
