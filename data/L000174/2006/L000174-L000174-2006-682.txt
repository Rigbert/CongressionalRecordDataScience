President, I thank my friends from Tennessee and Texas for their courtesy.  I commend the Senator from Maryland. I enthusiastically--enthusiastically--cosponsor this amendment. It is going to bring relief to employers by easing the shortfall of seasonal workers. I know it is desperately needed in Vermont.  Last May we passed, and the President signed into law, assistance for small and seasonal businesses by enacting a special exemption. The amendment passed last May, offered by Senator Mikulski, cosponsored by myself, Senator Jeffords, and others, created an exemption to the cap for seasonal workers.  The Vermont ski, hotel, and conference industries rely on hiring foreign workers when they cannot find Americans to fill seasonal jobs. Over the past several years, the demand for these workers across the country has far exceeded the caps and has led to a severe shortage of workers which threatened the hospitality industry which is such an important part of Vermont's economy.  Senator Mikulski's amendment will simply extend the sunset date and give businesses in Vermont, Maryland, and other States the resources they need to compete and succeed. We need this relief in Vermont. The broad range of bipartisan support for this amendment shows how badly it is needed.  I thank the Senator for her persistent efforts. I thank my good friends on the other side of the aisle for the courtesy they showed a late arrival.  I yield the floor.
