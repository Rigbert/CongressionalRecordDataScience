 President, I am pleased the Senate passed the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996. However, I am disappointed the Senate rejected the Kennedy amendment to the minimum wage increase.  I cannot sit idly by as I hear of those struggling to live on today's minimum wage. I thought, as many of you do, that the typical minimum wage earner was someone like my daughter or one of her friends: a teenager flipping burgers or taking food orders to earn some extra cash for new clothes or a movie.  That, however, is a grave misperception. The sad fact is that 73 percent of those earning between $4.25 and $5.14 an hour are over the age of 20. That means that 9 million adults this year will have to try to live on a salary of $8,840. One-third of these sameadults are the sole sources of income for their families. If these workers were attempting to support a family of three, they would fall $2,682 below the Federal poverty line.  I am extremely concerned that 58 percent of those struggling with a minimum wage are women--5.2 million women, many of these single mothers, would benefit directly from this increase.  These single moms are trying. They are trying to raise two kids on a below-poverty income. And how does Congress reward a struggling parent's hard work? By attacking Medicaid that would have paid for her son's asthma medicine. By cutting the child care support that enables her to work. By taking away funding for nutrition programs that pay for her kids to eat at school or day care. By eliminating her Head Start Program that gives her kids a chance at coming to school ready and able to learn. By refusing to add 90 cents to her hourly wage--a wage that pays for heat, clothing and food.  Aren't these exactly the same individuals and families we are trying to keep employed and off of Federal support? Instead, this Congress has targeted the low-income family with cut after cut and a resistance to move them above the poverty line.  Mr. President, the Kennedy amendment would not have eliminated jobs. It would have barely kept people working--people who otherwise would be completely reliant on public support. If we had only passed this amendment a year ago, it would have meant that the single mother would have earned an additional $2,000 today.  To low-income families, that would have meant more than 7 months of groceries, 4 months of rent, a full year of health care costs, or 9 months of utility bills.  I did not reach my decision to support the minimum wage hastily. I have listened carefully to the concerns of small business owners from across my State, who have highlighted the implications of this increase. I don't want to see prices for the American consumer rise or jobs eliminated. But I don't think an increase to the minimum wage will end employment in small business, either.  It has now been more than 5 years since the last minimum wage increase. We must remember that the value of the current minimum wage has fallen by nearly 50 cents since 1991 and is now 27 percent lower than it was in 1979. Now is the time to adjust that inequality and demonstrate a true commitment to our working families.  A slight increase in this wage provides those who work hard and play by the rules an increased opportunity and a chance to succeed. If any of my colleagues opposes the minimum wage, I urge them to live on $8,840 this year and then reconsider their vote.  Mr. President, I want to take a minute to express my support for title I of H.R. 3448, the small business provisions. This section incorporates a variety of tax changes, pension simplifications and S corporation reforms that expand business opportunities for America's small businesses.  We all know small business is the engine that drives the American economy. As large corporations across the country downsize and consolidate, innovative small businesses expand and add jobs to the work force. In 1995, 22,000 individuals in Washington State were employed by software-related companies--66 percent of these companies are small businesses with less than 11 employees.  This legislation will only make it easier for these and other small businesses to invest in research and development, raise capital and spur economic growth.  Most importantly, the legislation reinstates several expired tax provisions including the research and development [R&D] tax credit and employer provided educational assistance.  The R&D tax credit is vital to small, technology-based companies that need to invest in long-term endeavors in order to stay competitive in rapidly changing business climates. At the same time, the employer-provided educational assistance is essential to maintaining a highly skilled, well-educated work force.  The legislation also improves the flexibility subchapter S corporations have when they set out to raise capital. Like S. 758, a bill which I cosponsored, this legislation raises the number of shareholders who can invest in S corporations. It increases the number from 35 to 75, and in doing so, this bill greatly increase an S corporation's ability to raise capital.  Mr. President, title I of this bill also incorporates two changes to our pension laws that were introduced in S. 1756, legislation I support that was introduced by Senator Moseley-Braun. First, the Treasury Department will be required to create a clear spousal consent form so that couples can make informed decisions about annuities. Also, Treasury will need to develop a qualified domestic relations order form spelling out how, to whom and when pension plans should be paid upon divorce. These provisions are essential to protecting spousal rights.  Finally, H.R. 3448 expands tax deductible IRA contributions to homemakers. This change will make retirement savings opportunities possible for individuals who work at home rather than in the work force. It will encourage greater savings in the United States, and it will improve retirement security for our hard-working homemakers.  Mr. President, even without the Kennedy amendment, this legislation still goes a long way to helping over 10 million hard-working Americans. This legislation ultimately raises the minimum wage 90 cents over 2 years. It rewards our working families as they struggle to rise above the poverty line. I am proud the Senate took this important and eagerly awaited step today.                           ____________________
