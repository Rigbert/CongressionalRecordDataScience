President, I would like to take a moment to pay tribute to MG Raymond Carpenter, the acting director of the Army National Guard, for his ongoing, selfless dedication and service to our country.  After enlisting in the South Dakota National Guard in 1967, Major General Carpenter joined the Navy and deployed to South Vietnam. After returning to the Guard as a Vietnam veteran, General Carpenter became a commissioned officer in 1974 and has since commanded at all levels. His efforts have transformed the Army National Guard from a strategic reserve into an operational reserve force, and the Army National Guard is now at its highest level of readiness in its 375 year history.  In our most recent conflicts, and through these tough economic times, General Carpenter has been credited for driving cost efficiencies that have saved millions of taxpayer dollars. General Carpenter led the Army National Guard through the drawdown in Iraq and oversaw a critical component of the U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, the implementation and expansion of the Guard's Agribusiness Development Teams.  General Carpenter's service to our Nation has come with considerable personal sacrifice from himself and his family. Rather than fill the role of the adjutant general of the South Dakota Guard and return home to live with his family, General Carpenter answered the call of duty, accepted the job of the director of the Army National Guard at the National Guard Bureau, and uncomplainingly shouldered a three star workload for his two star pay. General Carpenter put his and his family's life on hold for over 2 years and lived at the mercy of the nomination process, never knowing when he might be replaced by a full director of the Army Guard. I call on my colleagues in the Senate to join me in honoring MG Raymond Carpenter, and I hope his successor will be confirmed in the near future.  I know that the entire Senate joins me in expressing my appreciation for General Carpenter's service to our grateful Nation.                          ____________________
