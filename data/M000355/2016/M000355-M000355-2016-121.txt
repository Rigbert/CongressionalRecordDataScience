 President, as we come to the end of this year and of this Congress, we will continue in our efforts to complete the business before us. Members have been working diligently on their respective conference committees to conclude the outstanding conference reports on the Defense authorization bill, the waterways infrastructure and resources bill, and the energy policy modernization bill. I look forward to the full Senate taking up these measures as they are available so that we can pass final legislation to be signed into law.  In the coming days, the Senate will also consider a critical and bipartisan medical innovation bill known as the 21st Century Cures bill, as well as acontinuing resolution to keep the government funded and carry us into the spring.
