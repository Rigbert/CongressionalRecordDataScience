 President, I am pleased today to introduce the James Guelff Body Armor Act of 1999.  Currently, Federal law does not limit access to body armor for individuals with even the grimmest history of criminal violence. However, it is unquestionable that criminals with violent intentions are more dangerous when they are wearing body armor.  Many will recall the violent and horrific shootout in North Hollywood, California, just two years ago. In that incident, two suspects wearing body armor and armed to the teeth, terrorized a community. Police officers on the scene had to borrow rifles from a nearby gunshop to counteract the firepower and protective equipment of these suspects.  Another tragic incident involves San Francisco Police Officer James Guelff, for whom this act is named. On November 13, Officer Guelff responded to a distress call. Upon reaching the crime scene, he was fired upon by a heavily armed suspect who was shielded by a kevlar vest and bulletproof helmet. Officer Guelff died in the ensuing gun-fight.  Lee Guelff, James Gueff's brother, recently wrote a letter to me about the need to revise the laws relating to body armor. He wrote:       It's bad enough when officers have to face gunmen in      possession of superior firepower . . . But to have to      confront suspects shielded by equal or better defensive      protection as well goes beyond the bounds of acceptable risk      for officers and citizens alike. No officer should have to      face the same set of deadly circumstances again.  I couldn't agree with Lee more. Our laws need to recognize that body armor in the possession of a criminal is an offensive weapon. We need to make sure that our police officers on the streets are adequately supplied with body armor, and that hardened-criminals are deterred from using body armor.  The James Guelff Body Armor Act of 1999 has three key provisions to achieve these goals. First, it increases the penalties criminals receive if they commit a crime wearing body armor. Specifically, a violation will lead to an increase of two levels under the Federal sentencing guidelines. Second, it makes it unlawful for violent felons to purchase, use, or possess body armor. Third, this bill enables Federal law enforcement agencies to directly donate surplus body armor to local police.  I will address each of these three provisions.  Enhancing criminal penalties for individuals who wear body armor during the commission of a crime: Criminals who wear body armor during the commission of a crime should face enhanced penalties because they pose an enhanced threat to police and civilians alike. Assailants shielded by body armor can shoot at the police and civilians with less fear than individuals not so well protected.  In the North Hollywood shoot-out, for example, the gunmen were able to hold dozens of officers at bay because of their body armor. This provision will deter the criminal use of body armor, and thus deter the escalation of violence in our communities  Making it unlawful for violent felons to wear body armor: This bill makes it a crime for individuals with a violent criminal record to wear body armor. It is unconscionable that criminals can obtain and wear body armor without restriction when so many of our police lack comparable protection.  The bill recognizes that there may be exceptional circumstances where an individual with a brutal history legitimately needs body armor to protect himself or herself. Therefore, it provides a mechanism for violent felons to obtain specific permission from the Secretary of the Treasury to wear body armor.  This provision has already been codified into law in California. Several other states are also actively considering legislation to restrict violent felons access to body armor.  California police applied the law for the first time earlier this year. Police arrested an individual for wearing body armor who had a violent criminal record. Besides a conviction for second-degree assault in 1993, the suspect is independently facing charges for threatening to kill his ex-girlfriend. He also is facing trial for issuing death threats against security guards at a West Hollywood Nightclub.  Direct donation of body armor: The James Guelff Body Armor Act of 1999 speeds up the procedures by which Federal agencies can donate surplus body armor to local police.  It is disturbing that so many of our local police officers do not have access to bullet-proof vests. The United States Department of Justice estimates that 25% of State, local, and tribal law enforcement officers, approximately 150,000 officers, are not issued body armor.  Getting our officers more body armor will save lives. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, greater than 30% of the 1,182 officers killed by guns in the line of duty since 1980 could have been saved by body armor, and the risk of dying from gunfire is 14 times higher for an officer without a bulletproof vest.  Last year, Congress made some inroads into this shortage of body armor by enacting the ``Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998.'' This act established a $25 million annual fund to help local and State police purchase body armor. The James Guelff Body Armor Act of 1999 will provide a further boost to the body armor resources of local and State police departments.  This legislation has attracted the support of a broad cross-section of thelaw enforcement community. The Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, the National Sheriffs' Association, the National Troopers Coalition, the International Association of Police Chiefs, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA), the Police Executive Research Forum, the International Brother of Police Officers, and the National Association of Black Law Enforcement Executives, have all endorsed the legislation.  Richard J. Gallo, President of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association notes:       In the past, FLEOA members have confronted individuals,      with prior criminal convictions, wearing body armor and      violently resisting arrest. Federal, state and local law      enforcement officers, and the public, deserve protection from      this, and at the very least, will now know theses felons will      receive enhanced sentences for using body armor during the      commission of a criminal act.  Robert Stewart, Executive Director of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, writes:       There is a societal obligation to assure the men and women      in blue are afforded all the protection they need to maintain      public order. Very real fiscal constraints can, however,      compromise the ability of local governments to accomplish      that critical goal. Hence, NOBLE heartily endorses the James      Guelff Body Armor Act of 1999.  I look forward to working with my fellow Senators from both sides of the aisle in turning this bill into law.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 783       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``James Guelff Body Armor Act      of 1999''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) nationally, police officers and ordinary citizens are      facing increased danger as criminals use more deadly      weaponry, body armor, and other sophisticated assault gear;       (2) crime at the local level is exacerbated by the      interstate movement of body armor and other assault gear;       (3) there is a traffic in body armor moving in or otherwise      affecting interstate commerce, and existing Federal controls      over such traffic do not adequately enable the States to      control this traffic within their own borders through the      exercise of their police power;       (4) recent incidents, such as the murder of San Francisco      Police Officer James Guelff by an assailant wearing 2 layers      of body armor and a 1997 bank shoot out in north Hollywood,      California, between police and 2 heavily armed suspects      outfitted in body armor, demonstrate the serious threat to      community safety posed by criminals who wear body armor      during the commission of a violent crime;       (5) of the approximately 1,200 officers killed in the line      of duty since 1980, more than 30 percent could have been      saved by body armor, and the risk of dying from gunfire is 14      times higher for an officer without a bulletproof vest;       (6) the Department of Justice has estimated that 25 percent      of State and local police are not issued body armor;       (7) the Federal Government is well-equipped to grant local      police departments access to body armor that is no longer      needed by Federal agencies; and       (8) Congress has the power, under the interstate commerce      clause and other provisions of the Constitution of the United      States, to enact legislation to regulate interstate commerce      that affects the integrity and safety of our communities.
