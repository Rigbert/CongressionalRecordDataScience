 I share their passion on this issue, having lost three young children in Bellingham, WA, a year and a half ago when a pipeline exploded at a school where my sister teaches seventh grade. It has impacted the lives of those families every single day since that explosion.  This is a passionate issue in my State. I have to say, before that explosion, no one knew that they lived next door to a pipeline. No one knew that their school was on a pipeline.  I commend them for bringing forward these provisions. They are all excellent. They are all incorporated into a bill that I have dropped in with the Washington State delegation today. If they are unable to pass on this bill, I urge my colleagues from New Jersey to continue to work with us.  This bill has a long way to go before passage, certainly as it goes through the House and through conference. These provisions are excellent ones that I hope will be incorporated into a final bill, regardless of what happens on the floor today.  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.
