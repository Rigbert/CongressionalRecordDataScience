Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to announce that the Calumet Project will be hosting its 9th Annual Job and Justice Awards Banquet on Friday, November 19, 1999, at the Social Hall of Our Lady of Perpetual Help Parish in Hammond, Indiana. The Calumet Project is a 15-year-old grassroots, labor-community-religious coalition that works for economic and social justice in Northwest Indiana. Each year, the Calumet Project honors prominent, extraordinary residents of Northwest Indiana for their tireless work to educate and organize people to fight for the betterment of all our lives. This year, four outstanding citizens from Northwest Indiana will be honored for their dedication to justice, and for their commitment to the people of Northwest Indiana.  One of this year's Calumet Community Hero Award recipients is Tom Conway. Mr. Conway is being honored for his dedication and contributions to the labor community. During the last year, he has been responsible for directing the United Steel Workers of America's (USWA) field campaign in the recent ``Stand Up for Steel'' efforts aimed at the steel imports which continue to be a source of concern to the USWA.  Additionally, Carlotta King and Jose Bustos will receive the Calumet Community Hero Award for their organizing efforts in their respective communities, Hammond and East Chicago. Ms. King's passion and focus has been to improve the quality of life for children. She is the board president of the Bethany Child Care and Development Center, and president of the board of V.A.U.L.E.S., a group that mentors African-American males. Ms. King also serves as a Redevelopment Commissioner for the City of Hammond. She is a strong advocate for community participation in the redevelopment of brownfield sites. Mr. Bustos has devoted much of his life to helping the people of East Chicago. He and his wife Eva started the group, ``The Youth Conqueror,'' which was responsible for bringing attention to how the increase in gang activity and violence was threatening the community's young people. Additionally, they started the Cesar Chavez Catholic Workers Community House. The community house has assisted many young individuals in different areas of their lives. Mr. Bustos has also been active in organizing a Christmas dinner for the needy, organizing a student walkout to protest against a toxic waste dump, and the protest against Napalm.  Reverend Michelle Cobb will also be receiving the Calumet Community Hero Award for her religious work in the community. Reverend Cobb is a native of Gary, Indiana. She has served as the pastor of the Marquette Park United Methodist Church in Gary, Indiana, and is currently senior pastor of the Merrillville United Methodist Church in Merrillville, Indiana. Cobb is a member of the NAACP, the Merrillville Kiwanis Club, and the Black Methodist for Church Renewal. She also serves on the Northwest Indiana Worker's Rights Board.  This year's Lifetime Achievement Award recipient, Reverend Dr. Robert Lowery, is one of the most dedicated citizens of Northwest Indiana. Dr. Lowery is the minister at St. Timothy Community Church in Gary, Indiana, and has spent nearly half a century providing leadership on economic and social justice issues. Dr. Lowery serves on the executive board for several organizations, including: the Northwest Indiana Urban League, the Calumet Council Boy Scouts of America, the Lake County Mental Health Association, and the Referral and Emergency Service.  State Senator Frank Mrvan will be presented with the One of Our Own Award for his support of workers' rights. Senator Mrvan has been a state legislator for more than 16 years and a member of the Hammond City Council for 10 years. He is a member and serves on the board of directors for the Hammond Chamber of Commerce, the Urban Enterprise Association, and the Hammond Development Corporation.  Christine Walters will receive the Special Recognition Award for her active role as a Calumet Project Board member and her leadership in economic and social justice actions. Walters joined the Calumet Project Board in 1994 and became a member of the Northwest Indiana Brownfield Redevelopment Project (NIBRP). NIBRP is an organization designed to promote the clean-up of polluted urban sites and to return these sites to productive use, while bringing increased tax revenue to our communities.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating these fine individuals for their dedication to justice and for their commitment to the people of Northwest Indiana.                          ____________________
