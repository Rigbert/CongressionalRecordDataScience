Speaker, today I am introducing a bill to make technical corrections to the United States Code. The bill updates cross references, corrects typographical errors, and makes stylistic changes such as conforming the capitalization of certain words.  The Office of Law Revision Counsel has prepared the bill and submitted it to the Committee on the Judiciary as a part of the responsibilities of the Office under section 285b of Title 2, United States Code that have been enacted into positive law so that those titles may be kept current.  Anyone with questions about the bill should contact Robert Sukol, Assistant Counsel, Office of the Law Revision Counsel, U.S. House of Representatives, H2-304 Ford House Office Building, Washington, DC, 20515-6711. The telephone number is (202) 226-9060.                          ____________________
