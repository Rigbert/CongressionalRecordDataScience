 President, I oppose this amendment. I feel exactly about Medicare and prescription drug issues as the Senator from Michigan, but this is not the way to do it. This amendment reduces our jobs and growth package even before the Finance Committee takes up a comprehensive prescription drug benefit and Medicare improvement bill.  I hope everybody knows that I am very committed to reporting a $400 billion bill out of the Finance Committee, and doing it this summer, hopefully within the month. This will add a comprehensive prescription drug benefit for seniors.  The amendment before us jumps the gun. I am working in a bipartisan way on a prescription drug policy that fits within that $400 billion framework in our budget resolution. In fact, I have a 4 o'clock meeting today with Senators on that issue that, obviously, I am not going to be able to keep because of these rollcall votes. We need to keep the jobs and growth package complete.
