 Led by their coach, Ken Lolla, these young student athletes made it to the championship game of the NCAA Division I tournament. In a close competition against the University of Akron they suffered their first defeat by one goal as the score was one to zero. This team spent most of the season ranked number one over the rest of their opponents. Becoming NCAA men's soccer runners-up is an accomplishment that has brought a lot of positive energy to the university as well as the entire city of Louisville. The team has made their university, city, Commonwealth and this Senator very proud. The Louisville Courier-Journal recently published an article describing the team's accomplishments. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:         Near-Miss a Big Hit for University of Louisville, City                            (Eric Crawford)       The game had ended in a flurry of breathtaking near-misses      for the University of Louisville men's soccer team. Akron's      players now were filling the TV screens at Molly Malone's in      St. Matthews, celebrating their national title. Then the      applause started. Fans at other locations reported something      similar. The mood hardly matched the disappointment of the U      of L players as they flashed onto the screen following their      1-0 loss to Akron.       ``What a great season,'' said Silas Boyle, a former      Louisville Thunder player and the goalie for the 1975      Kentucky Country Day state championship team. ``What a great      job they did. There's no way not to be proud.'' No, there      isn't. Not with Louisville sports bars turning their      attention to another kind of football on an NFL Sunday.       Snow fell outside the bar for most of No.1-ranked and      previously unbeaten U of L's loss, just as it did in the      final home game. As the game clock wound down, you could see      out the windows the wet reflection of traffic and      streetlights in the middle of a busy holiday scene.       It was a nice reminder that while the experience of a      national championship game is something that coaches and      players earn, for fans and program and city, it is a gift.      It's a gift U of L teams have given twice in the past three      seasons.       And as with the run to the national title game in women's      basketball in 2009, this soccer run was designed by a coach      who's hard not to respect, one who manages to coach the team      without becoming its focal point.       David Horne, player and general manager for the Louisville      Lightning professional team, said U of L coach Ken Lolla's      reach extends far beyond his program, that he has quietly      become a mentor for local coaches--``I read every book he      mentions,'' Horne said--and a resource for players and clubs.       ``To me, he could become a [John] Wooden-like influence,''      Horne said. ``I know that's a big name, but that's how he      carries himself and how he coaches. He's going to keep      winning, and he does it the right way.''       Akron, after controlling possession in the first half,      exerted itself still more in the second. By the time the Zips      scored in the 79th minute, U of L keeper Andre Bordeaux      already had put together a highlight reel of saves.       Still, the Cardinals had some golden opportunities in the      end, the last when two-time last-minute hero Aaron Horton's      strike into a goal whose keeper had strayed was deflected on      the ground by a defender's leg.       Another foot or two higher, and the score would've been      tied. But after Horton's last-minute game-winners in back-to-     back NCAA games, how much magic does one player's foot      possess?       Instead, U of L comes home with a runner-up trophy and a      new profile in college soccer. If you know athletic director      Tom Jurich, you can go ahead and put a soccer facility      expansion or enhancement on the stopwatch.       For soccer in Louisville, there's added energy--and perhaps      some momentum in building the kind of much-needed soccer      complex that a city this size already should have, one that      would keep local clubs from having to travel to Bowling Green      and other places for big tournaments.       For U of L, it's another NCAA championship chance in a      sport that not long ago wasn't anywhere on the national      landscape. ``You just have to believe it's only the beginning      for that program,'' Horne said as fans headed home Sunday      night. ``It's a really exciting thing for the sport in this      city.''       It's pretty rare around here for another kind of round ball      to grab any part of the spotlight in December. For the local      sports scene, it was a holiday gift. For Lolla and the      Cardinals, the goal is to make it a holiday tradition.                          ____________________
