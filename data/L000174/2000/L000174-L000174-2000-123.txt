President, I thank my friend from Alaska for his usual courtesies. I will take time on our side briefly.  I thank the Senate Chaplain, Dr. Ogilvie, for his courtesy in inviting today's visiting Chaplain, Father Claude Pomerleau. Father Pomerleau is very special to me; he is my brother-in-law. He is the chairman of the department of history and political science at the University of Portland. He has a distinguished career, a doctorate from the University of Denver, where actuallyN O T I C EEffective January 1, 2001, the subscription price of the Congressional Record will be $393 per year or $197 for six months. Individual issues may be purchased for $4.00 per copy. The cost for the microfiche edition will remain $141 per year with single copies remaining $1.50 per issue. This price increase is necessary based upon the cost of printing and distribution.                                                              Michael F. DiMario, Public Printerone of his lead professors was Dr. Madeleine Albright's father. He speaks many, many languages. He is seen as a leading authority on Latin America. He teaches in Chile as well as at the University of Portland--in fact, he just came back from there.  I could go through all these things about him, but from a personal point of view he is very special to me. His sister, Marcelle, and I have been married now for 38 years, and he was present when we were married, as were his brother Rene and his father and mother, Phil and Cecile Pomerleau. Phil and Cecile are no longer with us, but I have a feeling they look down in pride at their son this morning, as we all do. He is a teacher, he is a mentor, a brother, a son, a beloved uncle--in our family he has been all of those and more.  He has been a very dear friend to me. I think of what Edward Everett Hale, a former distinguished Senate Chaplain, once said. He was asked:       Do you pray for the Senators, Dr. Hale?  And he said:       No, I look at the Senators and I pray for the country.  I am privileged to have a brother who not only prays for the country, but prays for this Senator. I consider it, in my 26 years here, one of the rarest privileges I have had to be able to see him on the floor.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
