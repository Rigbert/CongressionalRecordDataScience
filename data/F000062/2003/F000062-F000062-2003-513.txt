 President, ``Success is to be measured not so much by the position one has reached in life, as by the obstacles which he has overcome while trying to succeed.'' This statement, made over 100 years ago by Booker T. Washington, rings true today.  Twenty-seven years ago, February was designated ``Black History Month.'' Today, I am pleased to join in the celebration of the many achievements and contributions African Americans have made to our history. I encourage all of you to celebrate this rich history of achievement year-round.  America's history has been shaped by the courage, talent, and ingenuity of African-Americans. Each February we rediscover familiar stories of those who triumphed over bigotry and hatred to help move our Nation closer to living up to its greatest potential. In the lives of Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth, Rosa Parks, and Thurgood Marshall we find heroes who dedicated their lives to liberty, freedom, and equality. During this month we also celebrate the achievements and vision of civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King, Jr. and Medgar Evers and are reminded that we must continue the important work they started.  A look through our own State's history reveals a rich portrait of African American achievement in California.  In science, George Edward Alcorn, Jr. is a brilliant physicist and inventor who has made considerable contributions to semiconductor technology and other scientific fields. He graduated from Occidental College in Los Angeles with a B.A. in Physics, and received an M.S. and Ph.D. in Nuclear, Atomic and Molecular Physics from Howard University. He has been issued more than 25 patents for his groundbreaking work and is most well-known for inventing the Imaging X-ray Spectrometer used for detecting life on other planets.  Dr. Alcorn has also been extensively involved in community service. He was awarded a NASA-EEO medal for his contributions in recruiting minority and women scientists and engineers and for his assistance to minority businesses in establishing research programs. He is a founder of Saturday Academy, which is a weekend honors program designed to supplement and extend math-science training for inner-city students in grades 6 to 8.  Mae Jemison, an African American physician, scientist and engineer, was the first woman of color to go into space more than 10 years ago. Dr. Jemison was only 16 when she entered Stanford University; she graduated in 1977 at age 20 with degrees in both chemical engineering and African American studies. A few years later, she received a medical degree from Cornell University. Dr. Jemison was selected by NASA in 1988 for Astronaut training and in 1992 became a mission specialist aboard the space shuttle Endeavor.  Throughout her career, Dr. Jemison remained undaunted by the lack of role models in her area of expertise and instead paved the way as a hero for women and minorities interested in the science and technology fields. She once said, ``I saw a world that was changing and I wanted to be a part of that.''  Last year, she was honored by the Mentoring Center in Oakland during a ceremony where she stressed the need for caring adults to reach out for young people in these troubled times. Just recently, Dr. Jemison encouraged a young audience at the Modesto Community College to shoot for the stars and realize their capacity to dream. She said, ``We have to have a vision of what we want the world to be in the future. We must combine lessons from the past with our responsibility for the present. It's the only way to have hope for the future.''  Politics: African Americans in the political arena have worked tirelessly to advance the civil rights of all people in California. Largely as a result of their efforts, African Americans are well represented in California local, State and Federal Governments.  Below is a short list of other African-American Californians who have made similar contributions to our State and communities across the Nation:  Yvonne Brathwaite Burke was the first black woman to be elected to the California General Assembly and the first to be elected to represent California in the United States Congress.  Congressman Ronald V. Dellums was elected to Congress in 1970. He was the first African-American to serve on the Armed Services Committee and was its first black chairman.  Herb J. Wesson, Jr. is only the second African American in California history to be elected the 65th Speaker of the California State Assembly, one of the most powerful positions in the State. As a student at Lincoln University, a historically black college, Mr. Wesson was inspired to pursue a political career while listening to a speech by then Congressman Ron Dellums of California.  During his career, Mr. Wesson has introduced bills that protected labor rights for immigrant workers, ensured pay equity across gender lines, increased funding for low performing schools, and promoted job training for at-risk teens. He has earned a reputation as a natural born leader, mediatorand bridge-builder, someone other Assembly members turned to when seeking to resolve a conflict.  Sports: African Americans have played an extremely influential role in the development of professional sports. Among the most prominent, Tony Gwynn has demonstrated excellence on and off the field. A native of Long Beach, Gwynn played baseball for the San Diego Padres for 20 years.  In addition to his incredible skill on the diamond, Gwynn became a sports hero for youth across the nation. Demonstrating sportsmanship, community service, and athleticism, Gwynn has won numerous community awards for his dedication and activism. He was inducted into the World Sports Humanitarian Hall of Fame in 1999.  California can also be very proud of its local African American heroes--those who often go unrecognized by the national community.  Improving the community relations in her native neighborhood of Watts, in Los Angeles, has been a lifelong commitment for ``Sweet'' Alice Harris. ``Sweet Alice,'' as she is affectionately called, is the founder of Parents of Watts, a program designed to encourage children to stay in school and away from drugs.  Today, Parents of Watts has grown into numerous organizations that provide emergency food and shelter for the homeless, offer health seminars, provide legal and drug counseling, and operate a program for unwed mothers.  Sweet Alice is truly one of the best known and most influential community leaders of her generation. Her lifetime of service and commitment to disadvantaged youth stems from her early years as a homeless teenage parent at age 16. In March of 2002, Lt. Governor Cruz Bustamante honored Sweet Alice with the Lt. Governor's Woman of the Year award for her tireless efforts for providing Los Angeles youth with a fighting chance in their community, a dedication that has spanned nearly 40 years.  This Black History Month, I would like to applaud all African American heroes who have overcome great adversity and risen to incredible heights of success. Many of these heroes have come from humble beginnings, making their successes and contributions to their communities all the more remarkable.  I look forward to the coming year in which we will, without a doubt, continue to see African Americans succeed and make a difference, both in their communities and in our country.                          ____________________
