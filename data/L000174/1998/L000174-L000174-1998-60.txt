President, recently a publication from St. Michael's College in Winooski Park, Colchester, VT, profiled Professor Edward Pfeifer. Dr. Pfeifer is referred to as ``Historian Ed Pfeifer, '43.'' I have always thought of Ed Pfeifer as the special mentor I had in college and the man who did so much to shape my thinking and my life after college.  He was the kind of professor who not only helped you learn, but taught you to want to learn. He would find students he could mentor and introduce them to the joys of learning. Fortunately, I was one of those students and I have benefited from his help every day since.  Ed and his wife, Joan, are now retired in Vermont. One of the great pleasures Marcelle and I have is when we end up in the same place with them, ranging from events at St. Michael's, to meeting in the grocery store near our own home in Vermont.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article from St. Michael's Founders Hall, September 1998, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From St. Michael's Founders Hall, Sept., 1998]                        Historian Ed Pfeifer '43                            (By Buff Lindau)       Nine-year old Eileen Gadue had to write an essay explaining      why she needed a new trunk to take her sneakers, swim suit,      tennis racket, and other belongings to summer camp. She      didn't know it, but she had Ed Pfeifer to thank.       Eileen's parents, Mark and Marjorie Gadue '79, of      Colchester, Vt., were both students of SMC Emeritus Professor      of History Edward Pfeifer '43 in the 1970's. They have shaped      their lives and their children's lives on Pfeifer's patient      insistence on developing ideas, supporting those ideas,      researching to back them, and working carefully with language      to clarify and defend the ideas.       After the fifth draft of her essay and repeated discussions      with Dad, Eileen got the new trunk.       ``He taught us life skills and we teach our kids as we      learned from him,'' said Marjorie. ``He was someone who made      a real difference.'' All his students say that Dr. Pfeifer      taught reading, thinking, debating, clear defending of ideas,      and taught with a hard to define skill that included quiet      patience, kindness, and intellectual rigor.       Mark Gadue graduated as a history major from Saint      Michael's in 1979 and almost headed to get his Ph.D., but      entered the family dry cleaning business instead.       Pfeifer students Gary Kulik '67, Joseph Constance '76,      Francis MacDonnell '81, Gayle Brunelle '81, and Jonathan Bean      '84 were inspired to aim for the professorial ranks as a      result of their experience in Pfeifer's classroom. ``I took a      number of years off after college, but he influenced me to go      back to graduate school and I am ultimately following in his      footsteps,'' said Bean, who was unanimously voted in May to      receive early tenure as a history professor at Southern      Illinois University. Bean, who took at least 10 courses with      Pfeifer, models his teaching on Pfeifer's style of      methodically eliciting student response. Bean is the author      of Beyond the Broker State: Federal Policies Toward Small      Business, 1936-1961.       Pfeifer says it was his goal to get a response from      students about the historical material they were studying,      ``something that was their own comment that reflected their      own evaluation.'' But the magic of Pfeifer as a teacher      resides in the method and manner he brought to the classroom      to get the students engaged, to elicit their response.       To Fran MacDonnell, a teacher who earned his master's in      history at Marquette and his Ph.D. at Harvard, ``Dr. Pfeifer      is in the handful of teachers that you admire and like to      imitate and that you owe a lot to. ``He had three, one-year      appointments teaching history at Yale University, and now he      and his wife live in Lexington, Va., where she teaches and he      finishes his second book--a study of white southerners who      fought in the Union Army during the Civil War. (His first      book is titled Insidious Foes: The Axis Fifth Column and the      American Home Front.) ``I can think of no greater legacy than      the one Ed Pfeifer gave his students--I mean Professor      Pfeifer taught my dad'' (Dr. Kenneth MacDonnell '57 a Boston      physician), MacDonnell said. He gave his students the drive      to think independently, and confidence in expressing their      thoughts.       Pfeifer was a master Socratic teacher, which meant using      the Q & A method to guide the student, leaving room for      different opinions and approaches and calling for      conclusions from the student. ``That is the hardest kind      of teaching, yet the one with the most rewards for the      student,'' MacDonnell said, who aspires to Pfeifer's      method.       Joe Constance concurs, ``Dr. Pfeifer was probably the      finest practitioner of the Socratic method that you'll ever      find as a teacher--getting the student to arrive at the      answer,'' and encouraging you as you progressed. Constance      says Pfeifer also inspired him to pursue the intellectual      life; he earned a master's in history at UVM and a library      degree at SUNY Albany. Constance is now library director and      political science professor at St. Anselm College, and is      pursuing his Ph.D. in political science at Boston University.       ``I asked Dr. Pfeifer a question in class one morning about      a trade agreement between Peru and Bolivia and he didn't know      the answer,'' Constance related. ``That afternoon I found a      note in my mailbox from him with the answer to the question--     I've never been so impressed with a teacher before or      after.''       Pfeifer's students all describe him as extremely kind and      concerned about them as individuals. They suggest that his      influence creeps up on you quietly and takes strong hold,      rather than hammering you. He was a model teacher and      scholar, one student said; fairness, balance, objectivity      characterized him. But there was humor--droll, quiet, dry--     but a key element in his make-up that emerged unexpectedly.       In 1986 Edward Pfeifer retired with his wife Joan Sheehey      Pfeifer to Cabot, Vt. He says he now has time to keep up with      his four children, chase after his grandchildren and mow lots      of grass. Because his teaching touched many who have gone on      to become teachers, Dr. Pfeifer's legacy multiplies beyond      his own classroom into the lives of students in university      classrooms from New Hampshire to Illinois to California. Ed's      son and daughter are graduates: John '85 and Justine '84 who      is married to Frank Landry '82. His brother, Charles '43 is      deceased.                         edward pfeifer profile       Pfeifer graduated from Saint Michael's in 1943 with a      degree in English, and served in WWII in the U.S. Navy, 1943-     46. He earned a master's in American civilization from Brown      University in 1948 and then joined the SMC English      department. He served in the Navy during the Korean War,      1951-53, and returned to Brown in 1954, where he earned a     Ph.D. in American Studies in 1957. Focusing on the history of      science he wrote a dissertation titled. The Reception of      Darwinism in the U.S.. 1859-1880. He rejoined the SMC history      department in 1956, and created the interdisciplinary      American studies major.       Pfeifer was vice president for academic affairs and dean of      the College from 1969 to 1974, and was awarded the first SMC      faculty appreciation award ever given, in 1966. He received      the award again in 1967 and 1982. Pfeifer retired in 1986 and      the SMC yearbook was dedicated in his name, yearbook editor,      Linda Robitaille '86 said, ``He was kind to his students, he      awed us, he was remarkably concerned with helping us learn.''                          ____________________
