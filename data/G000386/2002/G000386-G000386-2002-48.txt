  The author of the Sense of the Senate resolution, Senator Harkin, has said ``it was my understanding the Finance Committee people had [his amendment] for some time and had looked at it.''  This was not the case, because I was not given the courtesy of knowing about or even seeing the resolution in advance. No one talked to me about it at all. In fact, my staff and I did not learn of the resolution until we saw it raised on the Senate floor. By the time my staff had the resolution in their hands, the Senate had moved on to other business, claiming that I was withholding my consent.  I believe the resolution, and all legislation to improve Medicare fairness in rural areas, deserves our attention and support. And I intend to support the resolution when we vote on it next week.
