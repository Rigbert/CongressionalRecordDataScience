Speaker, so today the United States House of Representatives voted in the next decade, the coming decade with the retirement of the baby boomers looming before us, to borrow, borrow $762 billion so the wealthiest among us can escape taxation and helping to carry the burden of the United States. On the same day the Republican leaders refused to allow any vote on an increase in the minimum wage, $5.15 an hour, the Federal minimum wage. Fairly extraordinary, but it says a lot about priorities.  On my side of the aisle there was near unanimity on increasing the minimum wage, and a large majority voted against borrowing $762 billion so we can give massive tax cuts to estates, for the most part, worth more than $25 million.  It is not about small business, family farms, tree farmers. There will be in 2009 an exemption of $7 million per family. That will take care of most small businesses, family farms, and tree farms that I am aware of. No. This is about the massive accumulation of wealth, some of it unearned.                              {time}  1830  For instance, let's take Lee Raymond, a wonderful gentleman, recently the CEO of ExxonMobil. We all know them well. They made $100 million a day last year. ExxonMobil made $100 million a day last year extorting the American public, the driving public, through price gouging and extraordinary profiteering.  Now, Mr. Raymond, who held the helm until recently, was rewarded fairly handsomely for doing that, a $400 million retirement payout. So this one gentleman, one gentleman, of course, he really worked hard to earn that $400 million, and he is going to have to limp through his retirement on $400 million, although I think he still gets to use the corporate jet, and they still would have to provide him some other emoluments suitable to his status.  But, in any case, this one change in the Tax Code is going to be worth an approximately $160 million tax break to Mr. Raymond. So while ExxonMobil is fleecing the consumers over here, Mr. Raymond gets a $400 million windfall pension, and then he gets from the Republican leadership a $160 million tax break.  Now, that might be kind of okay, except they are going to borrow the money to give him the tax break. We are borrowing right now $1.3 billion a day to run the Government of the United States, and with this new tax break for the richest among us, estates worth more than $25 million, we are going to borrow another $210 million a day. Our credit is good. Isn't that great? That is the good news, they would say, our credit is good.  Unfortunately, the bill isn't going to go to Mr. Raymond. The bill is going to go to people who work for wages and salaries. Under the bill that passed here today, a schoolteacher will pay a higher rate of taxation on their salary than Mr. Raymond will on his windfall from ExxonMobil. Now, that is fair in their world. It is not fair in my world, and it is not fair to the people I represent.  You can look at it another way. The next decade, as the Social Security annual surplus diminishes down towardzero toward the end of the decade, roughly the surplus during that decade will be about $780 billion. So we are going to borrow the entire surplus collected to pay the benefits of retired Americans; of course, not Mr. Raymond, he is not too worried about it, but other Americans, and we are going to give that as a tax break to people who have estates worth more than $25 million.  Isn't that great? And they say this is about small business and family farms. No, it is about feeding those who have given so generously to you. This is the contributor class that we are talking about here, and the contributor class is awfully generous and has been incredibly generous to George Bush over his political career and extraordinarily generous to the Republican majority here in Congress.  So, it is not too much to ask that they should pass a bill that gives them a $762 billion windfall, hands the bill to working Americans, and they hope to stay in power. A very sad day for the United States House of Representatives.                          ____________________[Pages H4496-H4497]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                    THE ESTATE TAX AND MINIMUM WAGE
