TITLE III--DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL STRATEGY     SEC. 301. FINDINGS.       (a) Prior to permanent closure of the geologic repository      in Yucca Mountain, Congress must determine whether the spent      fuel in the repository should be treated as waste subject to      permanent burial or should be considered an energy resource      that is needed to meet future energy requirements.       (b) Future use of nuclear energy may require construction      of a second geologic repository unless Yucca Mountain can      safely accommodate additional spent fuel. Improved spent fuel      strategies may increase the capacity of Yucca Mountain.       (c) Prior to construction of any second permanent geologic      repository, the nation's current plans for permanent burial      of spent fuel should be re-evaluated.     SEC. 302.
