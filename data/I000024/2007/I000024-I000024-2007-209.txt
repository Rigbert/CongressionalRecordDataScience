President, first of all, I don't see Senator Baucus here. He is the chairman of the subcommittee. He did a great job on this. We worked closely together. They called us the big four, the chairman and ranking member and the chairman and the ranking member of the subcommittee. We all worked tirelessly on this. We are all pleased with the product we have.
