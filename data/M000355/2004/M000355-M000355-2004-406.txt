 President, let me describe why the McConnell amendment is preferable to the Kennedy amendment. My colleagues will be given an opportunity in the next few minutes to vote on two approaches to administration reporting on Iraq. The Kennedy troop estimate requirement is entirely too burdensome. We cannot predict troop levels 5 years in advance. No one is that good. Political developments in Iraq will drive security estimates so we cannot determine now what our needs are going to be years in advance.  Kennedy's 30-day requirement would not give the Department of Defense enough time to staff a report, much less complete one.  I recommend voting for the McConnell alternative which is a reasonable reporting requirement from the Defense Department related to Iraq.
