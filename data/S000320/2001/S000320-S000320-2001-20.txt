 149) with 2 days of debate. In discussions with Senator Thompson, he related to me that he was working with leadership on both sides to form an agreement in which we would permit S. 149 to be considered on or after September 4th, but that myself and Senators Thompson, Kyl, Warner, and Helms would be guaranteed 2 days to present, debate and have votes on our national security related amendments. This agreement will give the Senate time to consider amendments that I believe will make this bill better for our national security. I look forward to a healthy debate and exchange of views.                          ____________________
