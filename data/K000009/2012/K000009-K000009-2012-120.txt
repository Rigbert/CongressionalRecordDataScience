Speaker, during the Christmas Season we remember people far and near and reminisce about those who are no longer with us. I rise to remember Jean Ward, who passed from this life on July 16, 2012.  Jean Ward was born in Detroit, Michigan on March 8, 1934 to Clarence and Agnes Ward. He graduated from Michigan State University and served in the U.S. Navy. Together he and his wife Jean raised five daughters. His family was most precious to him.  Jean worked with the City of Toledo in forestry, and then began a career with the Toledo Area Metroparks. He became the Metroparks Director in 1985 and served until his retirement after 35 years in service to the organization. During that time he was Founding Director of the Stranahan Arboretum. His tenure brought a growth which established the Toledo Area Metroparks as a hallmark of our region. Jean Ward was ``an ambassador of conservation. He had a passion and a dedication to protecting, preserving and improving natural areas for all to enjoy.'' His legacy will last through the ages. His extraordinary efforts brought him statewide recognition when, in 2009 he was inducted into the Ohio Parks and Recreation Association Hall of Fame and later received a Lifetime Achievement Award.  I was privileged to work with Jean through many years of shared public service. Though he will be missed by all whose lives he touched, his spirit carries forward in the natural beauty his efforts enshrined for generations to come.                          ____________________
