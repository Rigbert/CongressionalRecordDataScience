Mr. Speaker, Ted Turner's $1 billion gift to the United Nations is remarkable. This man saw a problem in this country, in this world, and he decided to help. He did not have to act, but he wanted to make a difference, and he will.  Ted Turner's gift is an inspiration to us all. It should inspire Congress to pay our debt to the United Nations. Bosnia, El Salvador, Somalia, as a community of nations, we have helped millions around the world.  Ted Turner's gift should also inspire each and every one of us to serve. Even though we all cannot give large amounts of money, we can care, we can get involved, in our schools and our neighborhoods, and we can make a difference.  So thank you, Ted Turner. You have reminded us all to be a little more caring and do a little more sharing.                          ____________________
