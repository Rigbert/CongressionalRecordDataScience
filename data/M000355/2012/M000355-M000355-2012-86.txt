 President, I stand before you today to pay tribute to a woman who has spent a significant amount of her life working to inform and entertain local communities in eastern Kentucky through the television station WYMT. After 20-plus years and a plethora of job titles within the company, Ms. Ernestine Cornett retired from her position as general manager in May of 2012 with as much passion and joy in her heart as when she first began.  In the mid-1980s, Ernestine, her husband, and their daughter relocated from the city of Lexington to Perry County. It was here that the admirable works produced by Cornett began. Responding to an ad in the newspaper began the journey of this extensive television-business career. I have great respect for Ernestine as she started at the bottom, worked hard, and eventually progressed to the top of the hierarchical ladder.  Ambitiously, she pressed through to accomplish great things, not only for eastern Kentucky but also for the television company in which she was employed. Working for WYMT television station, Ernestine knew that her friends and family would be adequately updated with weather and news announcements, as well as sports and other forms of entertainment. The television station matured and displayed ample signs of success while Ernestine was aboard with the company.  Her motivation in life was to make sure that eastern Kentucky was knowledgeable and well-informed. Finally, after 27 years of working, Ernestine Cornett retired in order to enjoy time with family and the next phase of her life. Ernestine trusts that WYMT will continue to prosper and the team members will carry on with her same passion.  The Hazard Herald recently published an article about the accomplishments of Ms. Ernestine Cornett, and I would ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record following my remarks.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Hazard Herald, May 30, 2012]       Ronald Reagan was president, very few people had ever heard      of high-definition television, and a small CBS affiliate with      the call letters WYMT was about to revolutionize the way      eastern Kentuckians got their news each day.       It was 1985, just two years after Ernestine Cornett and      husband Keith had returned to their native Perry County with      their four-year-old daughter Ashley in tow. Keith had just      sold his accounting and income tax business in Lexington.       They were, as Ernestine put it, ``starting over in familiar      surroundings.''       A graduate of Hazard High School, and then Morehead State      University, Ernestine Cornett had been substituting in the      city and county school districts when she ran across an ad in      the Hazard Herald for a position at this new television      station. She answered the ad, interviewed with a Lexington      broadcaster by the name of Ralph Gabbard, and got the job in      the avails coordinator position, a job which she described as      consisting of inputting advertiser information and ensuring      that the ad would have time on the air.       ``Frankly, at the time, I had no idea what I was suited for      in the television business,'' Cornett said. ``Certainly I had      no experience, but evidently Mr. Gabbard knew.''       Mr. Gabbard must have known, because in a couple of years      she took the position of sales assistant and then office      manager. And then, in 1990, when station manager Wayne Martin      was promoted to the WKYT station in Lexington, Cornett also      received a promotion and began what would be a career heading      WYMT that would last more than 20 years. That career will      come to an end with Cornett's retirement later this month,      but it was Martin whom she credited with her long tenure at      WYMT, and with her landing the job in the first place.       ``Certainly Wayne Martin was a big part of my success at      WYMT, as he recommended me for his replacement, and although      I was intimidated at the prospect, I knew it was a once-in-a-     lifetime opportunity,'' Cornett said.       Martin returned to Hazard on Tuesday of this week, as he      attended a special lunch to honor Cornett's career and noted      that her leadership has been a cornerstone at WYMT now for 22      years.       ``Her leadership has been one which I know I've tried to      emulate because of her integrity, and sense of fair play, and      her absolute passion for eastern Kentucky,'' Martin said.       WYMT was purchased by Gray Television in 1994, an Atlanta-     based media company that owns several other stations,      including WKYT in Lexington and WVLT in Knoxville. When Gray      took over WYMT, Cornett's title changed to vice-president and      general manager.       In the years that Cornett has headed WYMT, the station has      shown growth and success, and has also maintained its      relevancy as eastern Kentucky's only localized television      broadcast. There are no other television stations that cater      solely to the eastern Kentucky market. The station has been      able to do that, Cornett explained, because the station      serves the community, both as a local advertising source and      a news outlet that offers hard news updates and features, as      well as weather, sports, and entertainment options for the      residents of eastern Kentucky. That was something that had      never been done on television prior to WYMT's creation.       And as a native and resident of eastern Kentucky, as well      as the leader of a media outlet, Cornett knows well the      importance that a news organization can represent, and the      service it can provide.       ``As a local, I was a manager fully invested in the success      of this station because I can remember what it was like      before WYMT came along,'' she said. ``I would not want to      return to those times. Now, I will be fully invested in the      station in new ways, as a viewer, as a consumer.''       But there have been a lot of changes and challenges along      the way that Cornett oversaw during her career. Gone are the      analog broadcasts, and WYMT's newscasts are not solely      offered on television anymore.       ``Our news can be watched on the World Wide Web and on      mobile devices,'' she noted. ``And, although it took us years      to get a satellite truck, there are now small portable      devices that can transmit news packages through phone and      data lines. Technology in this business is always moving      forward. Our challenge is to keep up.''       Cornett will spend her last day at the station in Hazard on      Friday, and of course, after a long career there are going to      be some things she will miss, from the people she meets every      day in the station's hallways to     the excitement of being inside the news machine as it does      its work. But at the same time, she knows that WYMT won't      miss a beat with the management team in place, and she's      certainly happy about that.       ``We have a great cohesive crew here and a great management      team in Neil Middleton, Jim Boggs, Louise Sizemore, and      Philip Hayes,'' she noted. ``I am leaving the station in very      capable hands, thus I have am leaving with a wonderful sense      of pride and peace.''       Cornett said she doesn't have any specific plans after her      retirement is final, and after attending school or working      for the majority of her life, she is ready for what she      called ``unstructured days.''       ``I have no immediate plans except to enjoy my family, get      up every day and do what pleases me,'' she said, and from all      accounts that is something she has certainly earned.       ``She's a very compassionate person, and she realizes the      needs, day to day, of the people that work here,'' noted Phil      Hayes, chief engineer at WYMT. ``She didn't micromanage      anyone, but she was able to comprehend and anticipate what it      took to make this station operate as efficiently as it has,      and she's just a great person to work with.''       ``You couldn't have a better boss than Ernestine Cornett,''      added Neil Middleton, WYMT's news director. ``I think the way      we look at Ernestine is, she was our boss, but more      importantly she is our friend, and she is family.''                          ____________________
