President, I commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for crafting this comprehensive pension reform measure to strengthen the defined benefit pension system and ensure the solvency of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.  One provision that I am pleased we were able to find bipartisan agreement on and include in S. 1783 is language that recognizes the special nature of multiple-employer defined benefit plans. These multiple-employer plans are sponsored by rural electric, rural telephone, and agriculture-related cooperatives. Nationwide, more than 1,700 cooperatives participate in a multiple-employer plan, providing benefits for over 109,000 workers and retirees. InKansas, more than 160 cooperatives will benefit from the multiple-employer provisions in this bill.  These cooperatives are not-for-profit, and provide at-cost services to their consumer owners. Multiple-employer defined benefit plans allow cooperatives to pool experience and expenses by maintaining a single plan as opposed to single-employer defined benefit plans that cover just one company's employees.  For companies that sponsor a single-employer plan, if that company goes out of business, the pension plan terminates, and if underfunded, creates risk to the PBGC. Multiple-employer cooperative plans are different because the pension plan continues to operate even if some cooperatives go out of business. Most importantly, no liabilities shift to the PBGC. These cooperative plans are ongoing plans that can outlive many of their participating employers, and are treated as such under this bill.  The Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, of which I am a member, and the Finance Committee, both recognized the special nature of multiple-employer plans, and their lack of risk to the PBGC, in their respective pension bills. During consideration of the HELP Committee's pension bill, the Defined Benefit Security Act, an amendment I offered to clarify the treatment of multiple-employer cooperatives was approved by unanimous consent. The Finance Committee adopted a different approach to recognize the unique nature of multiple-employer plans.  As the committees worked to bring a bill to the Senate floor, I, along with several of my colleagues, shared our concerns about the need to include multiple-employer cooperative language in a final bill in a letter to the chairmen and ranking members of the HELP and Finance Committees.  While different from the provisions of both the HELP and Finance Committee bills, the multiple-employer provisions in S. 1783 achieve their goal. S. 1783 provides a 10-year delayed effective date for these rural cooperative plans, continues to exempt these plans from the bill's at-risk rules, and provides special funding and premium rules during this 10-year period. With regard to funding, these plans will use the four year weighted average of the third segment rate of the corporate bond yield curve created in this bill. For purposes of the premium rules, these plans will use a spot version of the third segment rate.  Mr. President, I urge the inclusion of the multiple-employer rural cooperative provisions contained in S. 1783 when a final pension reform bill is sent to the President for his signature. These provisions have bipartisan support, recognize the special nature of rural cooperatives, and provide an important benefit for over 109,000 employees and retirees across the country.  I ask unanimous consent to print the letter to which I referred in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                               Washington, DC, September 23, 2005.     Hon. Michael B. Enzi, Chairman,     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy, Ranking Member,     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, Russell          Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles Grassley, Chairman,     Hon. Max Baucus, Ranking Member,     Committee on Finance, Dirksen Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Enzi, Chairman Grassley, Senator Kennedy and      Senator Baucus: We write to urge you to continue recognizing      the special nature of rural cooperative ``multiple-employer''      defined benefit plans sponsored by the National Rural      Electric Cooperative Association, the National      Telecommunications Cooperative Association and the United      Benefits Group (agriculture-related cooperatives), as you      work toward an agreement on comprehensive pension reform. By      design, these rural cooperative plans are different because      they would continue to operate even if some cooperatives go      out of business. Most importantly, no liabilities shift to      the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC).       Both the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee      and the Finance Committee have recognized the special nature      of ``multiple-employer'' defined benefit plans of these rural      cooperatives. We believe that any bill sent to the floor for      consideration should include both Committees' provisions.       These rural cooperatives are not-for-profit, and provide      at-cost services to their consumer-owners. Their defined-     benefit plans permit them to pool experience and expenses by      maintaining a single plan for hundreds of employers, as      opposed to single-employer plans that cover only one      company's employees. We have concerns that unless these      specific cooperative provisions are included, these entities      may be forced to either reduce benefits to their employees or      pass along substantially increased costs to their member-     owners.       For companies that sponsor a single-employer plan, if that      company goes out of business, the pension plan terminates,      and if underfunded, creates risk to the PBGC. Again, these      rural cooperative plans are different because the pension      plan continues to operate even if some were to go out of      business, and no liabilities shift to the PBGC. In fact, none      of the liabilities of these rural cooperative ``multiple-     employer'' plans have ever been shifted to the PBGC.       These rural cooperative plans are ongoing plans that can      outlive many of their participating employers, and they      should be treated as such under any bill that goes to the      floor. Again, we urge you to include both Committees'      provisions in any bill sent to the floor to recognize the      special nature of rural cooperative plans, their ongoing      nature, and their lack of risk to the PBGC.       Thank you for your consideration of this request.           Sincerely,         Pat Roberts, Lamar Alexander, Johnny Isakson, Gordon            Smith, Craig Thomas, Tom Harkin, Jeff Bingaman, Ron            Wyden, Tim Johnson, John Thune.
