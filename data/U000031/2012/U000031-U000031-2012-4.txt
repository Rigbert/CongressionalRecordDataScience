And I rise with so many to honor a really good friend, Jay Pierson.  Years ago I came to this Capitol Hill as a congressional aide. I had the pleasure of working as a legislative aide at the White House, and then I headed Congressional Affairs at the Office of Management and Budget. And my job was what's going on; make sure my boss, the President of the United States, in essence, knew what was going on. That meant I had to have a direct line right here.  And this was before C-SPAN. You couldn't turn on the TV and watch what's going on. Sorry.  And by the way, Mr. Petri, there are 30 million people watching tonight as they let us honor Jay Pierson. But you had to know what's going on, and Jay was my contact. He was my link. He would let me know what was going on.  I have to say that when I probably surprised a few people and became a Member and actually had a voting card here, he still had my back. He really did. And there's probably not a week, probably not a week certainly when we've been in session, but even when we've been out of session, that I haven't called his office to find out what's going on and be able to share with my colleagues and really do the people's business.  We've had a great relationship, we really have. And just like he had my back, he had the back of every Member in this institution. He taught us the rules and the procedures, time on amendments, how to get things done.  When we took over the majority and actually had to run the Speaker's chair, he knew the rules then and walked us and guided us through those procedures. And frankly, he did it the way that our Founding Fathers wanted it to be done.  On our side of the aisle, he really followed folks who loved this institution, who really knew its rules, people like Billy Pitts and Ron Lasch and Jim Oliver and J.L. Cullen, and Peggy and Tim, who are here tonight. They care about not only the institution, but the people on both sides of the aisle to make sure that this place runs the way that it should. =========================== NOTE ===========================     On Tuesday, December 18, 2012 on H6858 the following appeared: On our side of the aisle, he really followed folks who loved this institution, who really knew its rules, people like Billy Pitts and Ron Lasch and Jim Oliver and Joelle Cullen, and Peggy and Tim, who are here tonight.

Jay, you're both. You really are. You care about the people's House, the U.S. House of Representatives, and we are so grateful for your decades of service.  And yes, Jay, you look just the same.  God bless.
