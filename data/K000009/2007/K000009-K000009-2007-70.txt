Chairman, I would just like to respond to the gentleman from Michigan and say that my district borders Canada too, across Lake Erie. The planes fly over our border, and we go up to Michigan and we take the Ambassador Bridge and so forth up into Canada. So we share those concerns. But what we don't share is our dismay at the lack of transparency that characterizes the Bush administration. What exactly are they discussing with the Government of Canada, with the Government of Mexico and other governments in the Americas?  We have a right to know. We have a right to participate. We want transparency and disclosure on the SPP. Their secretiveness about what is going on is a deep concern. Vote for the Hunter-Kaptur amendment.
