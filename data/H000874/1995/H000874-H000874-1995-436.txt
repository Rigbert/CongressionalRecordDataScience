Chairman, this is not a new issue. It is an issue that is easy to make fun of. The American public hears you have got push-button elevators. What do you need an operator for? Like all the elevators around the country, they are run by computers and the computers cannot tell, they are not as sophisticated as human beings still.  And human beings, as the chairman has pointed out, can make a difference, can make judgments, can make sure that people get up and down the 7 floors of the Longworth Building or the 6 floors or the 5 floors of the Cannon and Rayburn Buildings so that Members can get to the floor on time.  We have just had a substantial incident where a number of Members were late getting to the floor. We had a big confrontation about that and the Speaker told us, voting in a timely fashion is important. We want to limit it to 17 minutes. This facilitates that at a relatively small cost. Why? Because the computers cannot tell as well as human beings can how to accommodate the 15-minute voting patterns.
