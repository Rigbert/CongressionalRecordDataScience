President, I come to the floor today to speak about the responsibility of Congress considering the referral from Kenneth Starr.  I am deeply concerned about how this is unfolding. This process is fast losing credibility. It is enough off track that the national interest, which should be our paramount concern, is suffering. It is enough off track that our institutions of government--the Congress, the Presidency, and the Constitution itself--may suffer damage that will linger long after we are all gone from the scene. The way we handle this responsibility, the character of our own institution is also at stake.  America, look where we are. The President has misused his office. Kenneth Starr is leaving in his wake a body of debris that will bring down the entire independent counsel law. And now that this matter is on our doorstep, we in the Congress increasingly risk, through our actions, undermining the public's faith and trust in our own institution of our own national government.  In these early stages of this inquiry into the actions of the President of theUnited States, it is time we ask whether we, ourselves, are on the verge of becoming not part of the solution but, instead, part of the problem, by harming our national interests and further eroding the public's confidence in their government.  Should we be disappointed and offended and angered by the President's conduct? Certainly we should be. As a father, a husband, as an American, and as someone who knows this President and supports the good he has done for the Nation, I am appalled and saddened by this episode.  These are difficult days in Washington and they are difficult days for the Nation. But this is a time when the Congress must rise above partisanship and look beyond short-term political objectives. We must consider what best serves the common good of the American people.  Four tenets must guide Congress' proper handling of the referral from Mr. Starr: We should put the national interests first in all of our considerations. Secondly, proceedings should be structured and enjoined to be as bipartisan as possible. Third, we must be fair. And fourth, we must move toward resolving this controversy as promptly as possible.  Early statements by the House leadership point in the right direction, but these have been overtaken by events and actions. I have noted on many other occasions my respect for Henry Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and John Conyers, ranking Democratic member of that committee. These two distinguished leaders have the wisdom and experience to work together for the good of the country and to construct a fair, bipartisan process. It does not augur well for such a process, however, that unilateral decisions and party-line votes already have become the norm, and the House has paid little attention to ensuring fairness in its initial decisions and actions.  The past several weeks have not been reassuring. The other body has yet to determine what rules and procedures should govern their actions, how our traditional notions of due process and fundamental fairness will be guaranteed, and how to prevent this process from degenerating into a partisan exercise. The House only now is beginning to examine the precedence and bipartisan actions of the House Judiciary Committee that considered the impeachment of President Nixon. In effect, they have put the cart before the horse.  Perhaps the meeting yesterday involving the House leadership will yield some progress. It is time for leaders in the House and the Senate, leaders from both parties, people of good will who put the national interests first, to reconsider how this matter is being handled and where it is headed.  A partisan train seems to be rolling out of the House station in a decidedly political direction. Perhaps it is too much to hope that Members, in the midst of reelection efforts, would view this matter through any prism other than their own campaigns or prospects for majority control in the Congress and the presidential election in 2000. The public is wondering whether this Congress can do anything serious now that election season is upon us.  Congress risks undermining the public's trust in our institutions of our national government. We must consider what best serves the common good of the American people and our national interests. This is a time when Congress must rise above partisanship and look beyond short-term political objectives.  Like Dwight Eisenhower before him, my friend and former colleague Senator Dole used his Farewell Address to the Senate in 1996 to warn of an impending danger to the Nation. He chose to speak about a fundamental lesson he learned in his years in Washington: that people of both parties must work together. He reminded Senators that we represent all our constituents--Republicans, Democrats, and independents.  On any consideration of proceedings to inquire into the possible impeachment of the President of the United States, as on matters of such overriding significance as the declaration of war or amending the Constitution, all Members of Congress must be mindful of the Nation's interests and the potential for harm that can be caused by pursuing narrow partisan goals.  We have already seen personal criticism of the President while he was overseas on a trip to Russia and Ireland. On Monday, the videotape of the President's appearance before one of the Starr grand juries was broadcast over the airwaves, even while the President of the United States was making a major address before the United Nations on international terrorism--one of the greatest current threats to our Nation's security and to stability around the world. These rash acts harm the Nation and they harm the international standing of the United States. Such actions may help the political fortunes of some in Congress, but they ignore the precedent of past Congresses where criticisms of the President were put on hold during those periods when he represents the United States in issues with other countries.  The national interest would not be served by a divided House membership proceeding to punt this matter to the Senate while they crossed their fingers and hoped for the Senate to bail them out of an ill-considered finding. The national interest should not be hostage to months of meandering through an undefined partisan process that leads inexorably to impasse. A lengthy, partisan impeachment inquest would serve no national purpose but only lead to a year of balkanized polarization that would poison a generation of relationships across the aisle in Congress and even across the Nation.  A fundamental lesson I learned as a practicing lawyer and that was reinforced when I served as the State's Attorney for Chittenden County, in my work as a U.S. Senator, as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and now as its ranking member, is that fairness in a process is critical to the result of that process. The process must be fair for the American people to find it credible. If it is not fair, the American people will not find it credible.  One measure of a prosecutor's fairness is fulfilling the duty to disclose exculpatory evidence. That aspect of fairness has constitutional implication in criminal matters. Now, weeks after the allegations have saturated the public media, we find buried in the thousands of pages of documents, transcripts and appendices that Ms. Lewinsky, the principal witness upon whom Mr. Starr relies for his charges, volunteered at the conclusion of her testimony before the grand jury that ``no one ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a job for my silence.'' Neither Mr. Starr, nor the lawyers working for him, felt any duty of fairness to ask this critical question. It was left to an anonymous juror who felt an obligation to the real issue at the heart of this matter.  One measure of the credibility of the House's proceedings will be whether it achieves the balance and fairness that so far has been lacking in the work of Mr. Starr's office.  An independent counsel does not have the checks and the accountability that enforce judgment and discretion in other prosecutors in this country. Wielding that enormous authority, therefore, it is incumbent upon an independent counsel to discipline himself with discretion and judgment. Unfortunately, in this matter, it is by this juncture quite clear that the report from Mr. Starr is an advocate's brief, intended to persuade, rather than the balanced presentation that should be the hallmark of such a somber exercise.  And, again, this makes it all the more important that the House exercise independent judgment and provide the balance and fairness that is lacking from the work of a zealous band of prosecutors.  I am concerned that the same House that is charged with this awesome responsibility is the body that is being asked to hold the Attorney General of the United States in contempt for having sought to protect the investigative process in connection with the ongoing campaign finance investigation.  I participated in a lengthy meeting with Senator Hatch, Mr. Hyde, Mr. Burton, Mr. Waxman, and the Attorney General on this matter on September 2. The Attorney General extensively consulted with us in a sincere effort to allow congressional oversight without compromising the ongoing investigation. In spite of the efforts shemade to satisfy any legitimate congressional oversight interest, and despite the lack of any basis to charge contemptuous conduct, the House persists in its efforts to pressure and sanction.  This effort and the lack of balance it signals do not bode well for the House's other tasks.  I recall, as well, that it was not too many months ago in this same Congress that Republican leaders in the House were urging that impeachment be used as a device to intimidate federal judges when they rendered decisions that a Republican Member did not like. Impeachment should not be used as a partisan, ideological bludgeon in any context. That is not the proper use of this important constitutional authority. Such comments, at a minimum, complicate the task at hand.  Nor is it reassuring to read accounts of meetings, on the other side of the aisle, in this body, where partisan litmus tests on this matter are being applied to those chairing committees in the Senate.  There are few matters of such possible significance that may come before Congress as the matter of a President's fitness to serve.  The people of the United States elected William Jefferson Clinton to the Presidency in 1992 and reelected him in 1996. He and the Vice President are the only people serving anywhere in the Nation in any office who were elected by the entire country.  Under our Constitution, the Senate is charged with the ultimate responsibility to act as the jury in connection with any charges that the House were to deem worthy of impeachment.  Never in our history as a country has the Senate convicted a President of an impeachable offense. Only in the tumultuous times following the Civil War has the Senate been through the ordeal of a Presidential impeachment trial.  Mr. President, I am honored to have been elected by the people of Vermont to serve as their United States Senator. In our history, only 20 other Vermonters have had the privilege to hold the seat I now have representing our State. I am proud to serve as the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. I appreciate my limited role in the Senate and in our government. I cannot take lightly being asked to judge whether a President, elected by the people of the United States, ought to be removed from office by an act of the Congress of the United States.  Now, the search for blame is a practiced congressional skill. It always bears fruit--sometimes bitter fruit. But the acceptance of our own solemn responsibility is more difficult. We must discharge our duties by serving the national interest, not by appealing to partisan or even public passions.  Let our actions not compound the Nation's anguish, harm the common good, nor further shake the public's faith in our institutions of self-government. These institutions have served this country well for over 200 years, in accordance with our Constitution, which has been a guidepost for that time. Our Constitution has survived because good men and women have stood up when needed to make sure it survives.  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I yield back the remainder of my time.                          ____________________
