President, this Friday marks the beginning of the 2012 London Olympic Games. Every 4 years, our national pride is displayed as we join our family and friends to cheer on Team USA. In this summer's London Games, the 530-member U.S. team will compete in 25 sports that span 246 medal events. Individuals and families make so many sacrifices just to have the opportunity to be a part of these competitions every 4 years. Rigorous physical challenges, early morning workouts, and total commitment are hallmarks of Olympians. Support of family and friends are also key to the success of these athletes.  Several of the team members have ties to my home State of Oklahoma. Many basketball players have Oklahoma ties--Blake Griffin, James Harden, Kevin Durant, and Russell Westbrook are all members of the USA basketball team. Many of us have followed Griffin's career from his early days, even before he was a University of Oklahoma Sooner. Then, of course Durant, Westbrook, and Harden are members of the Oklahoma City Thunder team that captivated our State and drew us together on their amazing journey through the NBA playoffs this past season.  All eyes will be on the Team USA's rowing team as they compete for a medal. Anthony Fahden of Oklahoma City, Will Newell of Oklahoma City, Tom Peszek of Oklahoma City, Nick LaCava of Oklahoma City, and Robin Prendes of Oklahoma City, will compete in rowing events.  Our State has a rich wrestling heritage. Three wrestlers, one from Oklahoma State University and two from the University of Oklahoma, will represent our Nation and State. Cowboy Coleman Scott and Sooners Jared Frayer and Sam Hazewinkel will continue that tradition in London as they hit the mat for Team USA.  Oklahoma will also be represented during the track and field events. Tia Brooks, a shot putter residing in Norman, secured a spot on the Olympic team with a big second throw at the U.S. trials. Brittany Borman, a javelin thrower also residing in Norman, secured first place and a spot on the U.S. team on her final throw at U.S. trials.  In gymnastics, Norman resident Jake Dalton will regale audiences on the vault and floor exercises. Meanwhile, in the pool, Mary Killman, who was born in Ada, will compete in solo, duet, and team synchronized swimming.  My wife Kay and I and our 20 kids and grandchildren will be watching these individuals and the entire U.S. Olympic team during the London Games, and we wish them every success as they make our State and our entire Nation proud.                          ____________________
