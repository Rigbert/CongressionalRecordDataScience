 President, the amendment I have sent to the desk is the amendment that I believe the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry, had indicated he was going to be offering today so that we can have an appropriate debate on this very important day about whether it is appropriate to withdraw American troops by the end of 2006. That is the second-degree amendment that I just sent to the desk.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
