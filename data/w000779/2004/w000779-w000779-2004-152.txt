President and colleagues, there is now clear evidence that it is open season for large-scale commercial marketing to the Nation's smallest children. As a result, today I am introducing with the distinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, legislation to protect the privacy of America's children.   I suspect parents of very young children would not want their children's names and addresses, their e-mail addresses, their ages and other datatreated as a simple marketplace commodity to be freely bought and sold for a profit with no questions asked. Yet that is exactly what happens every day.   Parents may not be aware of it, but large list brokers routinely advertise and sell information on very young children for marketing purposes. Their lists cover millions of children and often include such data as ethnicity, family income, and hobbies or interests. In short, commercial trafficking in personal information about very young children is surprisingly commonplace.   How extreme has it gotten? Take a look at this example. The broker of this list says on their Web site that they have more than 15 million names of children from the ages of 2 to 13. They said they update it monthly. That is why it is clear it is open season for large-scale marketing to the country's smallest children, which has concerned Senator Stevens and I. The list brokers break it down for the marketers, as well, to help them target the very young.   On this next graphic, a list broker offers marketing lists that only contain the names of preschool children ages 2 to 5. If that is too young for a particular marketer's needs, the marketer could pursue lists of elementary school children ages 5 through 11 or junior high school kids age 11 to 13. These lists of young children are advertised openly on the Internet for anyone who is interested.   We can see the details promised: Full name, address, and age. My view is that is not information about youngsters that parents want available for sale without the consent of the parents. But it is happening now all the time because there is big money in marketing to the very young. Children, of course, influence the purchases of their parents. Sometimes they have money to spend of their own. As a result, an estimated $12 billion per year is spent on marketing to these very young children.   Unfortunately, with all the money involved, the ethics of direct marketing to children and appropriate limits get short shrift. The very young are not likely to understand the intent and tactics of marketing pitches the way adults do and may be more vulnerable to influence, manipulation, and questionable and deceptive tactics. The wholesale trafficking of specific information about individual youngsters and the use of that information to target and contact those children for marketing purposes is something that most parents find very troubling.   The suggested use for these lists runs the gamut. Here is another list broker that has 20 million names of children in preschool through eighth grade. They have all kinds of suggestions. We can see a few of the examples on the chart that make it clear exactly how great this potential market is.   That is why I am introducing today, with the bipartisan support of our colleague, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, a privacy act to protect our youngsters.   The bill's premise is simple: Trafficking in data on very young children for the purpose of commercial marketing should not be permitted in our country. Specifically, the bill bans the selling or purchasing of personal information about people that the seller and purchaser know to be very young. There would be an exception for cases where the parent is given express consent, provided that the parent had notice of what he or she was consenting to and was not required to grant consent as a condition of obtaining a desired product or service.  There would also be an exception for the sale of information for nonmarketing purposes as long as the purchaser certifies it will neither use the information for marketing nor allow others to do so. This exception would allow, for example, health care officials to still use available data to track the spread of a disease or for students, of course, to get information about various academic activities. The list buyers would have to certify that lists are not being purchased or resold for marketing; otherwise they will be in violation of the law.  The bill's enforcement provisions track those of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. Primary enforcement authority would rest with the Federal Trade Commission, and State attorneys general would be authorized to bring enforcement actions as well.  I think we all understand marketers have products they want to get out, and lists are a big part of their trade. But it is one proposition when the person on the list is an adult; it is quite another to be buying and selling and trafficking in all of this data and all of these lists on the very young.  I say to the Senate, if you just spend a little time on the Internet, you will see what I have concluded; that it is open season for the large-scale marketing that is targeted at very small children, and we ought to make an effort to draw some lines.  Yes, marketing is accepted and important with respect to adults. But I hope my colleagues will join me and Senator Stevens today in supporting a commonsense effort to limit the way in which data is used and commercialized about America's smallest children.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation I am introducing today with Senator Stevens be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2160       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Children's Listbroker      Privacy Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds the following:       (1) Commercial list brokers routinely advertise and sell      detailed information on children, including names, addresses,      ages, and other data, for use in marketing. This data is      commonly available on children as young as two years old,      enabling marketers to target specific demographics such as      junior high school, elementary school, or even preschool.       (2) Commercially available marketing databases can be very      large, covering millions of children.       (3) Commercially available marketing databases can include      a variety of information on the children they cover, from      ethnicity to family income to hobbies and interests.       (4) Money spent on marketing to children has been estimated      at $12 billion per year.       (5) Several Federal statutes, including section 1061 of the      No Child Left Behind Act, the Children's Online Privacy      Protection Act, and the Family and Educational Rights and      Privacy Act, restrict the collection and disclosure of      information about children or students under specified      circumstances. When data on children is collected in a manner      that is outside the scope of those statutes, however, Federal      law does not significantly restrict the commercial sale or      resale of such data.       (6) The ability to sell information about children to      marketers for a profit creates an economic incentive to find      new and creative ways to collect and compile such      information, and possibly to circumvent or subvert the intent      of those Federal statutes that do govern the collection of      information about children or students. There are a variety      of means and sources that marketers and list brokers can and      do use to compile names, addresses, and other data about      children.     SEC. 3. RESTRICTION ON SALE OR PURCHASE OF CHILDREN'S                    PERSONAL INFORMATION.       (a) In General.--It is unlawful--       (1) to sell personal information about an individual the      seller knows to be a child;       (2) to purchase personal information about an individual      identified by the seller as a child, for the purpose of      marketing to that child; or       (3) for a person who has provided a certification pursuant      to subsection (b)(2), in connection with the purchase of      personal information about an individual identified by the      seller as a child, to engage in any practice that violates      the terms of the certification.       (b) Exceptions.--       (1) Parental consent.--Subsection (a) does not apply to any      sale, purchase, or use of personal information about a child      if the parent of the child has granted express consent to      that sale, purchase, or use of the information.       (2) Certification.--Subsection (a)(1) shall not apply to      the sale of personal information about a child if the      purchaser certifies to the seller, electronically or in      writing, before the sale is completed--       (A) the purpose for which the information will be used by      the purchaser; and       (B) that the purchaser will neither--       (i) use the information for marketing that child; nor       (ii) permit the information to be used by others for the      purpose of marketing to that child.     SEC. 4. ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
