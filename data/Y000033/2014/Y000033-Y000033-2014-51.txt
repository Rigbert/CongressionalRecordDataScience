Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3998, as amended, will direct the GSA to convey property in New Mexico to the Amy Biehl High School Foundation for fair market value. The Amy Biehl High School is a public charter school that has been using the building since 2006.  While the school currently leases the facilities from the General Services Administration, GSA only receives nominal rent, making it more costly to the taxpayer to maintain the property. In fact, the Amy Biehl Foundation has invested funds to renovate and restore the building for use as a school.  GSA has determined there is no Federal need for the property and concluded the cost of managing this building exceeds any revenue. Selling this property for fair market value will ensure the taxpayer receives the best return on the property.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
