Though it will help some homeowners who are facing foreclosure, this bill requires asking a few additional questions.  Why would Congress want to pass a bill that uses bankruptcy as the first option to resolve only some loans, and not all loans, as opposed to invoking the full power of the FDIC and SEC to handle all loans?  This legislation will ``protect mortgage services from legal liability.'' Why would we do this at the same time as we are sending individual homeowners to the bankruptcy gallows?  Why would we pass a bill that eliminates the government's share of any appreciation in the home's value at sale?  Madam Speaker, these are some of the questions for which this bill does not provide answers to those critical questions.  Most of all, this bill continues to reinforce the seriously flawed mortgage securitization approach to the U.S. housing market. The overarching concentration and securitization of the housing mortgage market by Wall Street bond houses and money center banks are continued in the bill rather than replaced by an approach that restores prudent Main Street lending practices again.  Our housing finance system is far too concentrated. Its system-wide imprudent practices centered in the securitization process, itself, have done enormous damage domestically and internationally and have ripped neighborhoods and communities apart across our Nation.  Responsible lending requires that our financial system re-empower the local banking, local underwriting and local mortgage markets first. This bill merely rewards the wrongdoers by letting them fall in the government basket of FHA, FNMA, and Freddie Mac.  A real reform plan should be the foundation stone that precedes any legislation that proposes to transfer hundreds of billions of dollars more to the very money center banks and servicing companies that have produced the chaos that ails our mortgage lending system today. Reform must come first, not last. No matter how well-intentioned any housing bill is, there must be a broader policy context in which it is advanced.  In sum, this plan does not do enough to address the fundamental cause of the financial crisis--widespread and overuse of concentrated securitization practices, mortgage and appraisal fraud, and the seize up of credit markets due to improper use of federal instrumentalities in attempting to resolve the situation.  This bill nips at the edges of a very troubled system, picks up some of the casualties, and lets the Titanic continue to chug toward some iceberg.  Our citizens deserve full justice, not continuing reliance on the very institutions that brought us to this fork in the road.                          ____________________
