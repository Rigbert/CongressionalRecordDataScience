President, I see the Democratic leader is rapidly leaving the floor, so he obviously does not want to hear anything more about our hearing, but this makes no sense whatsoever.  This is an example of the dysfunction of the Senate. How does it make sense that the Aging Committee, which operates in a completely bipartisan manner, is being prohibited from holding a hearing that is important to our seniors and that has nothing to do with the issues that are in the news today?  I just don't understand why we are being prohibited from proceeding to do our work, to do our important jobs on an issue where we have four experts from four different States, including the State of the Democratic leader, including a witness chosen by the ranking member of the committee, and none of that matters. We are being prohibited from holding this hearing.  Mr. President, it is a great disappointment to me--and I am sure it is going to be a great disappointment to our witnesses and our committee members--that we are going to have to cancel this hearing for reasons that are totally unrelated to the subject of this hearing.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  Seeing no one seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
