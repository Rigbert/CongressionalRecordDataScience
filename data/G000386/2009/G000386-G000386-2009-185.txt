 Mary Jo Hoffman was a loyal and trusted adviser to me and a beloved friend to my wife, Barbara, our family, and many of my Senate staff who served with her more than a decade ago and still, in a sense, are serving with her today.  Always filled with purpose, Mary Jo spent the last 2 years 4 months fighting cancer with the tenacity, strength, and determination we all knew and loved about her. When Mary Jo set her mind to something, she didn't let much get in her way. She was that way when I met her when she was a bright young college student at the University of Northern Iowa, my alma mater, and she was that way when she worked effectively to serve constituents, first as a legislative correspondent, then as scheduler and as a top aide in my Senate office, and later on when she worked for my political campaigns. I valued her judgment and appreciated her hard work and commitment to quality in every position she held. Mary Jo also taught at night as a volunteer and earned a master's degree while working on Capitol Hill.  She reached out and gave to others in so many ways through her church, in her community, and even on the U.S. Air Force base in Greece where she lived for a short period of time with her husband while he was serving. Someone in need had a friend in Mary Jo. She always got a lot done, and she did it in a way that was generous, spirited, and committed to ideals.  Mary Jo was a person of great faith. She provided leadership wherever she went through worship and fellowship and with the example she set with her own life. Mary Jo was a faithful witness for Christ and never more so than the darkest hours and days of her last 2 years. She will continue to inspire those of us who were lucky enough to have her in our lives.  We all mourn Mary Jo's departure, and our heart goes out to her family, including her devoted husband, Brent, and mother, Karen. I know Mary Jo's beautiful young children, Silas and Lydia, will miss her every day. I pray that they find comfort in the honorable life lived by their mother and my dear friend Mary Jo. She served the people of Iowa and the Lord with distinction and humility. She left this world for the next with courage and grace.  I wish to read one sentence from the Sioux City Journal which I think sums up her life: ``Her words were like thunder because her life was like lightning.''  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have the full text printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From Sioux City Journal, Aug. 4, 2009]                            Mary Jo Hoffman       Sioux City.--Mary Jo Hoffman, 44, passed on to heaven on      July 31, 2009, having lived life well and faithfully. She      leaves a timeless legacy of faith and love for family and      friends. Her words were like thunder because her life was      like lightning.       Memorial services will be 11 a.m. Thursday at Heartland      Community Baptist Church, 3601 Country Club Blvd., Sioux      City, with the Rev. Gene Stockton officiating. A luncheon      will follow the memorial service. Burial will be at a later      date in Arlington National Cemetery, Washington, D.C.

Born in Centerville, Iowa, on April 5, 1965, Mary Jo was a      precocious student and musician, graduating as class      salutatorian from Chariton (Iowa) High School in 1983. She      adored her family and friends.       She received her bachelor of arts degree from the      University of Northern Iowa in 1987, graduating with high      honors. During a distinguished career, she put her faith in      action through teaching and public service. She worked on      Capitol Hill for many years, serving proudly on the staff of      Senator Chuck Grassley. She also earned a master of arts      degree from George Mason University in Arlington, Va.       While living in Virginia and attending First Baptist Church      of Alexandria, Mary Jo (Archibold) met and married Brent      Hoffman. She joined Brent on military assignments in Greece      and at the Pentagon. Their children, Silas and Lydia were      born in 2000 and 2002, and she promptly set all career plans      and ambitions aside. In 2004, they returned to their native      Iowa and Sioux City. Though she maintained interests in      fundraising and community service, she was a mother who put      her family's needs first and foremost. She enjoyed reading,      music, cooking, politics, knitting and most of all, visiting      with friends and family.       Though admired for her extraordinary achievements, she was      beloved for her faith and kindness. She accepted Christ as      her Savior and her faith in God was the driving purpose in      her life. Friends describe Mary Jo as a bright shining light      who lived a life pleasing to God. Her influence will not be      forgotten.       Survivors include her children, Silas and Lydia; her      husband, Brent; her parents, Ron and Karen Stein of Mason      City, Iowa; a sister, Malinda Hilzer of Des Moines; and many      other relatives, all of whom she loved and are left to      cherish her memory.       She was preceded in death by her father, D.W. Archibold;      and her grandparents.       A memorial has been established in the name of Mary Jo      Hoffman at Heartland Community Baptist Church.                          ____________________
