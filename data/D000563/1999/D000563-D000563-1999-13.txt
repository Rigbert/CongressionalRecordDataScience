We have spent more time this morning on the floor of the Senate talking about providing health insurance to the uninsured than we have spent in the entire session this year debating any proposals to deal with the problem.  I would say to my friends on the Republican side of the aisle that if you have an idea, or a concept, or a piece of legislation, come forward with it. Let us put our best proposal on the table. That is what the Senate is supposed to be about. It is supposed to be a contest of ideas, and the hope that when it is all said and done, the American people will prosper because we will come out with something that improves the quality of their lives. This year we have not.
