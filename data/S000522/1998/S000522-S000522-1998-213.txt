Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res.364) urging the introduction and passage of a resolution on the human rights situation in the People's Republic of China at the 54th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 364                Whereas the State Department's Country Reports on Human      Rights Practices for 1997 state that ``[t]he Government [of      China] continued to commit widespread and well-documented      human rights abuses, in violation of internationally accepted      norms,'' including extrajudicial killings, the use of      torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, forced abortion and      sterilization, the sale of organs from executed prisoners,      and tight control over the exercise of the rights of freedom      of speech, press, and religion;       Whereas, according to the State Department, ``Serious human      rights abuses persisted in minority areas [controlled by the      Government of China], including Tibet and Xinjiang [East      Turkestan], where tight controls on religion and other      fundamental freedoms continued and, in some cases,      intensified [during 1997]'';       Whereas, according to the 1997 Country Reports, the      Government of China enforces its ``one-child policy'' using      coercive measures including severe fines of up to several      times the annual income of the average resident of China and      sometimes punishes nonpayment by destroying homes and      confiscating personal property;       Whereas, according to the 1997 Country Reports, as part of      the Chinese Government's continued attempts to expand state      control of religion, ``Police closed many `underground'      mosques, temples, and seminaries,'' and authorities ``made      strong efforts to crack down on the activities of the      unapproved Catholic and Protestant churches'' including the      use of detention, arrest, and ``reform-through-education''      sentences;       Whereas, although the 1997 Country Reports note several      ``positive steps'' by the Chinese Government such as signing      the United Nations Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural      Rights and allowing the United Nations Working Group on      Arbitrary Detention to visit China, Assistant Secretary of      State John Shattuck has testified regarding those reports      that ``We do not see major changes [in the human rights      siguation in China]. We have not characterized China as      having demonstrated major changes in the period over the      course of the last year'';       Whereas, in 1990, 1992, and each year since then, the      United States has participated in an unsuccessful      multilateral effort to gain passage of a United Nations      Commission on Human Rights resolution addressing the human      rights situation in China;       Whereas the Government of China has mounted a diplomatic      campaign each year to defeat the resolution and has succeeded      in blocking commission consideration of such a resolution      each year except 1995, when the United States engaged in a      more aggressive effort to promote the resolution;       Whereas China's opposition to the resolution has featured      an attack on the principle of the universality of human      rights, which the United States, China, and 169 other      governments reaffirmed at the 1993 United Nations World      Conference on Human Rights;       Whereas on February 23, 1998, the European Union (EU)      agreed that neither the EU nor its member states would table      or cosponsor a resolution on the human rights situation in      China at the 54th Session of the United Nations Commission on      Human Rights;       Whereas on March 13, 1998, the Administration announced      that it would not seek passage of a resolution at the United      Nations Commission on Human Rights addressing the human      rights situation in China;       Whereas without United States leadership there is little      possibility of success for that resolution;       Whereas, in 1994, when the President announced his decision      to delink Most Favored Nation (MFN) status for China from      previously announced human rights conditions, the      Administration pledged that the United States would ``step up      its efforts, in cooperation with other states, to insist that      the United Nations Human Rights Commission pass a resolution      dealing with the serious human rights abuses in China'' as      part of the Administration's ``new human rights strategy'';       Whereas a failure vigorously to pursue the adoption of such      a resolution would constitute an abandonment of an important      component of the ``expanded multilateral agenda'' that the      Administration promised as part of its ``new human rights      strategy'' toward China; and       Whereas Chinese democracy advocate and former political      prisoner Wei Jingsheng has stated that ``[t]his [United      Nations Commission on Human Rights] resolution is a matter of      life and death for democratic reform in China'': Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--       (1) urges the President to reconsider his decision not to      press for passage of a resolution on human rights violations      in China at the 54th Session of the United Nations Commission      on Human Rights;       (2) expresses its profound regret that the European Union      will not table or cosponsor a resolution on human rights      violations in China at the 54th Session of the United Nations      Commission on Human Rights; and       (3) urges all members of the United Nations Commission on      Human Rights to support passage of a resolution on human      rights violations in China at the 54th Session of the United      Nations Commission on Human Rights.
