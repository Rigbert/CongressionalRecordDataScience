 The Republican leadership appears to be very reluctant to do that. You know, we have been through this, some of us in this Chamber, back in the Reagan and Bush era, when we were told to just have confidence and faith in the so-called Laffer curve. That was appropriately named, the Laffer curve, and some of the different approaches, that it was all going to work out, we could increase spending, cut taxes, and when it was all over the economy was going to blossom and flourish. It didn't happen. What did flourish was our national debt during the Reagan-Bush era because we were buying into the economic theories of extreme thinkers. The Republicans have a tendency to gravitate toward extreme thinkers. I think we are hearing from those folks again.  I think most of us would agree we should reduce Federal mandates where they just involve bureaucracy and paperwork and do not serve a national purpose. But do not go too far. If the Republicans want to go so far as to jeopardize environmental quality, jeopardize health standards, they have gone too far. They should stay away from that extreme thinking.  We should move toward a balanced budget amendment, but from my point of view, more important than that is economic growth in this country. I would like to make sure we are creating new good-paying jobs. That should be our highest priority, not some bookkeeping standards that really do not pay any attention to the real world. That is the kind of extreme thinking Americans are not going to buy into. They want this Government, this Congress, to be sensitive to the real problems, to the real families, to the need for jobs, to the need for business to the need to expand.  Merely paying homage to some bumper sticker with some extreme viewpoint is not serving the national purpose.  I yield to the gentleman from California.
