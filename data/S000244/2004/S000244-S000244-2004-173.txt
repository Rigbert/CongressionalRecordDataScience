Chairman, I yield myself the balance of the time.  Mr. Chairman, I will just repeat myself. The issue is settled law. There cannot be a coerced or forced recitation of the Pledge. This bill does notchange that. The amendment allows the courts to determine what coercion shall be. That has far-reaching consequences. I think that the best vote to prevent unintended consequences from occurring is ``no'' on this amendment. I urge that it be defeated.
