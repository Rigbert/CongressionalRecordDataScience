328 is a bipartisan amendment that Senator Kyl and I have cosponsored with Senator Domenici, Senator Bingaman, and others. It deals with the national fire plan. Suffice it to say, Senators know that the West over the last few summers has just been an inferno. We expect another very hot summer. This legislation is a bipartisan initiative which would allow us to set aside additional funds for forest restoration, hazardous fuels reduction and fire research, and real on-the-ground collaboration with States and localities to help them improve their environment and protect against catastrophic fire. It is backed by the timber industry and a host of environmental groups. I see my colleague from Arizona on the floor as well.  It is a bipartisan amendment on which Western Senators cooperated. I urge my colleagues to support it.
