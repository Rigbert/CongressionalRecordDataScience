 President, today the Senate Agriculture Committee began marking up the commodity title to the 1995 farm bill. Although I am no longer a member of that committee, the farm bill has as much impact on my State as any other piece of legislation considered before this body.  For that reason, Mr. President, I have used my position on other committees to indirectly influence farm policy. I have also formed a group, the Farm Policy Coalition, that is cochaired by Senator Dorgan and consists of 52 Members of the Senate. In order to more directly influence the debate.  Today, however, the Agriculture Committee was not able to agree on a farm bill to take to reconciliation. And there are rumors that the Budget Committee may have to act to make the necessary cuts in farm spending. As a member of the Budget Committee, I publicly stated that the Agriculture Committee, and not the Budget Committee, is the best place to write the farm bill.  But now with the Agriculture Committee deadlocked, I feel it necessary to send a clear signal, as a Budget Committee member and a Senator interested in the future of agriculture, on how I believe we should proceed on the 1995 farm bill; taking into consideration what is in the best interests of my State and American agriculture as a whole.  Therefore, Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Farm Income Transition Act of 1995. This bill is similar to one introduced by the distinguished chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Pat Roberts, known as the Freedom to Farm Act.  My bill represents a transition to a new era of farm programs; an era that will be characterized by limited Government intrusion in the market and the unleashing of the productivity of American agriculture. Yet the Federal Government will still play a role in providing a safety-net for the family farmer.  Mr. President, this bill is a dramatic departure from the farm programs of the past. We all know that our current farm programs were established during the Great Depression of the 1930's.  The intent of the program then, as it is now, was to stabilize farm income while ensuring a dependable, abundant, and inexpensive food supply. This is accomplished mainly by making direct payments to farmers when commodity prices are low, and implementing production controls to limit the supply of commodities.  To a large extent, the programs of the past have been successful. The American consumer spends less than 10 percent of their disposable income on food; the lowest of any Nation in the world.  Despite its success, the farm program has had many critics. Some criticize the program for its high degree of Government intervention. Others argue that the benefits go primarily to large, corporate farms. Many farmers, themselves, have grown tired of the endless amount of paperwork and redtape associated with the program.  Through all the criticism, however, the farm program has remained virtually unchanged for the last 50 years. But times have changed. And these changes mandate that a new direction be taken on farm programs.  The crisis of the 1930's was rampant unemployment and poverty. Drastic action was needed to support the income of ordinary Americans.  The crisis of the 1990's is rampant Government spending and intervention into the lives of ordinary Americans. The voters told us in no uncertain terms last November that they wanted the Government out of their lives and the budget deficit brought under control.  Mr. President, the Senate approved a budget resolution this spring that will bring the Federal budget into balance in the year 2002. This resolution contains a sense-of-the Senate calling for a cut in spending on agriculture commodity programs of about $9.6 billion over the next 7 years.  During the debate on the budget, I voiced my strong opposition to further cuts in agriculture spending. I will not repeat all of the arguments I made at that time, but it is clear to me that agriculture has contributed disproportionately to deficit reduction in the past. All I asked for at that time, Mr. President, was that agriculture be treated equitably in the budget process.  I also argued during the budget debate that agriculture, more than any other sector of this economy, has much to gain by achieving a balanced budget.  Agriculture is a capital-intensive business, its success dependent on low-interest rates. Only by getting our fiscal house in order can we ensure a sustained period of low-interest rates and the continued success of the family farmer.  So although Federal spending on agriculture will be reduced, because this reduction is within the context of a balanced budget, agriculture will benefit greatly in the long run.  But, Mr. President, it is vital that as Federal spending on agriculture is reduced, the regulations and restrictions on individual farmers are reduced accordingly. Because if farmers are getting less from the Government, they must have the tools to earn more income from the marketplace.  This bill meets both of these goals: It reduces spending to meet the requirements of my sense-of-the Senate in the budget resolution and it dramatically reduces the regulatory burden placed on farmers.  Mr. President, I will take a moment to describe how this bill accomplishes these goals. First, it mirrors the Freedom to Farm Act by providing farmers with a 7-year contract consisting of annual payments. In return, the farmer must maintain compliance with current conservation requirements. The total payments over the 7-year period are capped at $43 billion, which meets the requirements of the budget resolution.  Furthermore, the regulatory burden on farmers is significantly diminished. For many years, the planting decisions of American farmers have been dictated, in part, by the U.S. Congress and the Department of Agriculture. This limits a farmer's ability to maximize his profit from the marketplace. These decisions must be removed from the hands of bureaucrats and put back into the hands of the farmers.  My bill provides for full planting flexibility. Farmers' planting decisions will no longer be restricted by their historical crop base. This will allow farmers to plant for the marketplace and not the Federal farm program.  The bill also eliminates the acreage reduction program. No longer will farmers be required to leave a portion of their productive land unplanted because of a mandate imposed by Washington.  Furthermore, the bill maintains certain aspects of the current farm program while reforming others. For instance, nonrecourse loans will continue to be made available. This is a necessary and important marketing tool for farmers that does not require direct Government spending.  On the other hand, the three-entity rule is eliminated. Payments will now be directly attributed to farmers instead of corporations and other entities.   Last, the bill provides for a new era of farm programs based on risk management. Specifically, it directs the Secretary to initiate a revenue insurance pilot program as an alternative to the crop insurance program.  Revenue insurance will cost the Federal Government no more than the current crop insurance program. But it will give the farmer a solid and dependable safety net.  The program will allow a farmer to pay a premium to protect himself from a significant decline in revenue, whether it is caused by crop loss or low prices. Thus unlike crop insurance, the farmer is protected from both natural disasters and from situations when too much grain on the market causes extremely low prices.  This revenue insurance program truly represents a revolutionary new farm program.  Mr. President, the future of American agriculture is not in Government payments and subsidies. The future of American agriculture rests on the ability of farmers to remain competitive in a world marketplace.  The role of government consists of opening access to new markets for agricultural products, providing research for the development of better crops and new uses for existing commodities, and providing a safety net for the family farm structure.  Mr. President, I am convinced that not only will American agriculture reach unprecedented levels of productivity and profitability in the future, but there will continue to be a vital role for the family farmer.  The independent, family farmer is still the backbone of the agricultural economy in my State of Iowa. These farmers tell me that they can compete with the large farms, if they only have a level playing field and equal access to markets and information.  Government should do everything in its power to provide this level playing field. I believe that the bill I have introduced today helps put all farmers on an equal footing as agriculture approaches the 21st century.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1276       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
