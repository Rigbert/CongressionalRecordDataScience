I share the Senator's view. I just add, this question of violent juvenile crime is especially important. Again, you see Senators of both parties who have done excellent work on this, Senators Hatch and Thompson--I have watched Senator Biden--all of whom have been very helpful to me and my staff in my early days as a Senator. I think they can help us put together a package dealing with violent juvenile crime.  In a lot of communities--the adult crime rate is still too high but has sort of leveled off--but the rate of violent juvenile crime has just gone through the stratosphere. In fact, the Justice Department had a study recently that showed, particularly between 3 and 7 o'clock, 3 in the afternoon and 7 in the evening, when you have these at-risk kids, that is when you really have a great portion of the violent crime in America.  There is nothing partisan about tackling violent juvenile crime. There are Senators of both political parties that have dealt with it and come up with innovative ideas. There are people like the criminologist, James Q. Wilson, who are advancing approaches that could be backed by both political parties to try to particularly make sure that these violent juvenile offenders are accountable.  But we are not going to get the important work done that the Senator from North Dakota is talking about without thoughtful debate that ensures that both sides have a reasonable opportunity. I hope the Senator from North Dakota takes the lead on this crime issue as a Member of leadership, and the kind of bipartisan approach the Senator is talking about will prevail, because issues like violent juvenile crime are issues that we can bring this body together on in a bipartisan way to deal with. I thank the Senator for yielding.
