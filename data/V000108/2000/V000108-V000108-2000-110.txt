Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Donna Osborn, who has worked in my office as an Albert Einstein fellow since July 1999. The Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Program offers elementary and secondary teachers with demonstrated excellence in teaching an opportunity to serve in the national public policy arena.  Since Donna's arrival in my office, she has handled all education issues--elementary, secondary, and higher education--as well as children's issues. She researches legislation, updates me on changing information, and answers constituent mail on these topics. Donna has also been invaluable in other areas of my office. I can guarantee you that she now knows more about steel manufacturing and bulletproof vests than she ever imagined she would. She is the first person to volunteer for any task, and greets every visitor with a warm welcome. Her enthusiasm is contagious.  Donna has not been a passive member of my staff, rather she has taken initiative and vigorously pursued projects that she believed would be valuable to my constituents. First, she organized and planned a grants workshop for all of the schools in Indiana's First Congressional District. Several Einstein Fellows and other individuals from Washington and Indiana provided educators with information on obtaining grants and other educational opportunities for students. She also reached out to our community, working with local businesses and organizations to include them in the event, and securing their place as stakeholders in the education of our children. This workshop was a very successful event, and would not have been possible without Donna's initiative and hard work.  Donna was also integral to the implementation of the Missing Child Alert Plan in Indiana's First Congressional District. The Missing Child Alert Plan gives detailed information about a missing child and the suspected abductor utilizing a joint police-media effort to alert the public when a child has been abducted. Donna worked closely with my staff and local police departments and media outlets, to get this program off to a successful start. The Missing Child Alert Plan has been successful in recovering missing children in other areas of the country. Thanks to Donna's hard work, Northwest Indiana is one of only 11 areas of the country with such a program. Activating the alert often receives considerable press attention, which increases the reach of the emergency announcement--enlisting hundreds of thousands of people in their search parties. Leads usually pour into police departments within hours. In addition to the Missing Child Alert Program, Donna saw to it that a picture of a missing child from the First Congressional District appears on each of my office envelopes. The first set features five children, one each from Gary and Hebron, and three from Hammond.  The zeal that Donna brought to my office must be even more apparent to her classroom. Donna has taught mathematics in Lafayette School Corporation in Lafayette, Indiana since 1972, and is currently a mathematics teacher at Jefferson High School. She is a graduate from Anderson College, with a degree in mathematics. Her master's degree is from Purdue University. She was a Christa McAuliffe fellow in 1998 and a Tandy scholar in 1997. She won the Presidential Award for Excellence in Teaching of Mathematics in 1996. She taught school in Billericay, England on a Fulbright scholarship in 1979-1980; at the International School of Paris in Paris, France in 1991-1992; and at the Hong Kong International School in the summer of 1997.  She served as the President of the Lafayette Education Association Board of the Indiana Council for the Teaching of Mathematics in 1996-1997, and on the Mathematics Department Advisory Council (Purdue, West Lafayette). Donna has received the Golden Apple award from the Lafayette Chamber of Commerce, and was recognized as a Distinguished Alumnus by the Purdue University-School of Science.  Donna has been a wonderful addition to my office, and I want to express my appreciation and gratitude for all of her hard work. She has touched the lives of countless young people throughout Indiana, the United States, and the world. Donna's passion for education and children, along with her indescribable enthusiasm, will surely be missed in my office.                          ____________________
