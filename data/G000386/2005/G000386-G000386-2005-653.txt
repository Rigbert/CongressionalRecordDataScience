 President. I rise today to pay tribute to an honorable soldier who has fallen in service to his country. Specialist Casey Byers of the 224th Engineer Battalion died on the 11th of June in Al Taqaddum, Iraq when an improvised explosive device detonated beneath his Humvee. Specialist Byers was a young native of Schleswig, IA, who was only 22 years old. I salute his patriotism and his sacrifice for the sake of freedom.  Specialist Byers was a proud American who joined the Iowa National Guard in1999. He graduated from Ar-We-Va High School in 2001 where he participated in football and track and later attended Iowa Lakes Community College. Specialist Byers graduated from the combat engineer qualification course in July 2004 and volunteered for duty with the 224th in Iraq. This was his second tour of duty in the Middle East.  Casey Byers has earned the highest gratitude of the entire Nation and today I want to recognize him with the respect he deserves. His sacrifice reminds us of the incredibly high cost of ensuring freedom. My prayers go out to Ann and William Byers who grieve the loss of their son, Paul and Jennifer Byers who grieve a lost brother, and his infant daughter Hailey who grieves the absence of her father. I also extend my prayers to all of the family, friends, and neighbors of Casey who are touched by his passing. I ask my colleagues to join me and all Iowans in remembering Specialist Casey Byers. Such men as Casey Byers inspire us to hold in ever higher esteem the ideals of freedom and service. His valor shall certainly not be forgotten.                          ____________________
