 The point I want to make in all seriousness, and we are almost ready, but, further reserving my right to object, the point I want to make is that this is a very serious proposal which will adversely affect middle-class working Americans, and I have a lot of good friends on their side of the aisle with whom I agree some of the time, but very frankly this is not a partisan issue in terms of those who are being focused on it. The gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Davis], the gentlewoman from Maryland [Mrs. Morella], and, as the gentleman mentioned, others share our concerns that we not in a short term, without serious consideration, without extended debate in the subcommittee or in full committee, without an opportunity for persons to be heard who will be adversely affected, impose on middle-class working Americans in effect a 10- to 12-percent tax increase.  Now we do it by increasing their pension from 7 to 9\1/2\ points. That is a 2\1/2\ point--about $750--$750 on the average [[Page H3123]] Federal worker, and that is akin to about a 10-percent tax increase. That is something we ought not to do in the fashion that we are doing it. That is the purpose of us rising.  Mr. Speaker, we are not going to object because there has been an agreement, and very frankly we understand, even if we objected, they could make a motion tomorrow to do the same thing, and I am convinced they would prevail, but I hope we look at this matter very closely. My friend from California said he may agree with me if we affected military retirement in this fashion. We would not want to do that. I say to my colleagues, don't do it to civil service employees any more than you would do it to military personnel in this fashion.
