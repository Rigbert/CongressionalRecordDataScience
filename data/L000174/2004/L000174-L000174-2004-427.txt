It reads:       The Committee recommends that USAID provide $2,000,000 in      Child Survival and Health Programs Fund and Development      Assistance to Laos--one of the world's poorest and most      repressive countries--through non-governmental organizations.      The Committee intends that these funds will not be used to      offset or substitute INL funding that would otherwise go to      Laos.       The Committee is concerned by the actions of the regime in      Laos, which continues to be responsible for serious human      rights abuses. The Committee is also concerned by the recent      detention and trial of an American citizen and two foreign      journalists in Laos. While the Committee is pleased that      these individuals have recently been released, it is deeply      troubled that the fate of four Laotian citizens accompanying      the journalists is still unknown.  Mr. McCONNELL. As I know my friend from Vermont is particularly interested in this issue, it would be both accurate and fair to say that it is our collective intention that this language be implemented.
