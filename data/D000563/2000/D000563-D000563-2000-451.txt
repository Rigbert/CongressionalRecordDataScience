President, reserving the right to object, I do not speak for my colleague from the State of Nevada, but I address this, not to my friend who offered the amendment butto the Senate in general. It would be much better, I think, if, when we file amendments, we have two copies so they can be shared with each side, rather than suspending the reading and having no knowledge of the substance of the amendment. That is the reason I object at this point. If there is a copy to be shared for us to read it, I would have no objection.
