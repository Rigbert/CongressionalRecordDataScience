 I appreciate it very much. If he would allow me one brief comment.  I think one of the reasons that for awhile the American automobile had lost the cutting edge was the reluctance to do research and development to develop those kinds of automobile products that became very popular, that were produced by the Japanese marketplace. Since then, the American automotive companies have changed dramatically. The very kind of innovation that was absent for so long has now been restored. So it would seem to me any innovation in weight or size or engine capacity could very easily overcome these problems and that these vehicles could function as efficiently. I will point out it is the largest single thing we could do to alleviate global warming. So I thank the Senator from Nevada.
