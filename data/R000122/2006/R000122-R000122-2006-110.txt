President, today, on behalf of the Greek Cypriot population of Rhode Island, and Greek Cypriots around the world, I recognize the 32nd anniversary of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus.  Shortly before dawn 32 years ago today, heavily armed Turkish troops landed on the northern coast of Cyprus launching the invasion and subsequent occupation of Northern Cyprus. Over the next 2 months, over 200,000 Greek Cypriots, an overwhelming 82 percent of the island's population, were forced to seek refuge in the southern Greek controlled portions of Cyprus. Turkey eventually called a ceasefire after seizing 37 percent of the island. To this day Turkey is the only country that recognizes the self-declared ``Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.''  Over the last 30 years, the United Nations Security Council and General Assembly have striven to resolve this ongoing territorial dispute through multiple failed peace talks and resolutions. While many years and much thought has gone into determining an equally agreeable solution, talks between the Greek Cypriot south and the Turkish Cypriot north constantly end in a stalemate.  However, hope was renewed this month when the United Nations began drafting recommendations on reviving stalled peace talks between this war-divided island's Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities. Furthermore, Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat were hailed by the Cyprus Parliament Speaker Demetris Christofias as taking positive steps toward restarting the Cyprus peace talks.  We must applaud the continued efforts of the United Nations and the renewed focus of the Cypriot leaders to reunite a divided Cyprus and remain committed to ushering the settlement process forward. Cypriot, Mediterranean, and U.S. interests will benefit from a settlement that addresses all legitimate concerns of both sides and promotes the stability of a hostile region.  Much like the Greek proverb, ``learn to walk before you run,'' Cypriot leaders must take small steady steps forward and continue forward even when the road looks unpaved. There is a path that leads to the reunification and peace between these two communities. Traversing this path, however, will take patience and tolerance.                          ____________________
