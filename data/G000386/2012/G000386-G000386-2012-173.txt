 President, today I am introducing legislation designed to help family farmers across this nation have a more level playing field when it comes to livestock markets. The bill would prohibit meat packers from owning livestock. The ownership of livestock by packers compromises the marketplace and hinders the ability of the farmer to receive a fair price. It is simple, as one meat-packing executive once told me, packers own livestock so that when prices are high, they slaughter their own livestock. When prices are low, they buy from farmers.  I would love to say opportunities for independent producers have gotten better since the last time we debated this bill during the 2008 Farm Bill. But that simply isn't the case. We are to the point where most farmers have to deliver their livestock to one of a few very large packers. Farmers' bargaining power is diminished by the sheer size and economic position of the packers. But beyond that, farmers have to compete with the livestock owned by the packing plant itself. The packer ban would make sure the forces of the marketplace work for the benefit of the farmer as much as it does for the slaughterhouse.  I am sure there will be folks in the packing industry that point out that farmers are doing okay right now, and that's great that farmers are experiencing a good period. I am pleased anytime the hard work of livestock farmers results in a good price. But I don't want my colleagues here in the Senate to be lulled to sleep and think just because prices are good right now means we don't have competition issues in the livestock industry that need to be addressed. This is about ensuring farmers are able to get fair prices for years to come. We need to work today, and implement this reform, to ensure the next generation of independent farmers has an opportunity to raise livestock and receive fair prices as a result of their hard work.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2141       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
