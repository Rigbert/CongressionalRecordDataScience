 President, this order allows that once the electoral vote counting is complete and the joint session is dissolved, we will adjourn until 3 p.m. on January 20.  As a reminder, January 20 is the date of the inauguration. We will convene later that day following the swearing in of the President and the Vice President. We expect to consider one or more of the President's nominations on that day and, therefore, rollcall votes are expected.  With that said, we will now wait for the message for us to return to the House Chamber.                          ____________________
