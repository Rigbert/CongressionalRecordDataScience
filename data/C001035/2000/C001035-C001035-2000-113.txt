President, I thank the Senator from Michigan. He is absolutely right in that we need to pursue a long-term energy policy for this Nation, as well as to provide short-term price relief by tapping our Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  I thank all my colleagues who have supported and have spoken out in support of this resolution, but particularly my primary sponsor of the legislation, Senator Schumer of New York. Since a point of order will lie against the amendment, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be withdrawn.
