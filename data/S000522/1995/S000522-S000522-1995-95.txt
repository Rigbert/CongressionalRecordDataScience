Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from California for his very fine statement. I urge Members to support this amendment. I think it is very pro refugee. As the gentleman pointed out, there are over $2 million in operating expenses for salaries for the State Department. We held seven hearings in my subcommittee. A portion of those hearings were looking at precisely that very point. There is room there, believe me, to fund the salaries and expenses of the PRN Bureau as there is using those proper spigots to fund the other bureaus and not take it away from the refugees, which again we tried to hold harmless.  I hope this amendment, if passed, will survive in conference, because again we are awash in refugees, and I think we need to recognize this is a modest effort we are making, and there is nothing above and beyond in preserving this $12 million.
