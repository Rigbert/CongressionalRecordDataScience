Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2194, the Iran Refined Petroleum Sanctions Act of 2009, which my good friend and colleague Chairman Berman introduced on April 30, and of which I am a co-sponsor.  Madam Speaker, this bill amends the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996 to impose sanctions on persons who sell to or service, or otherwise commercially or financially support, Iran's petroleum industry. The bill responds to Iran's lack of refining capabilities--Iran imports 40 percent of its gasoline and relies on foreign companies to develop its energy industry. Limiting Iran's access to refined petroleum could have a major effect on the Iranian economy--and on Ahmadinejad's policies.  Even as President Obama opens diplomatic talks with Iran, we know, from all our experience with Iran and so many other dictatorships, that a serious effort to peacefully stop Iran's development of nuclear weapons will require the strongest political and economic pressure our country can muster.  Madam Speaker, it will not only be worth the effort, but it's absolutely necessary that we make this effort. In this regard, I want to point out that we have repeatedly seen the correspondence between the way a government treats its own people and the way it behaves internationally. It seems to be almost a law of international relations: massive human rights violators behave deceitfully and aggressively, and the more massive the violations, the greater the deceit and aggression.  The law has certainly held in the case of the Ahmadinejad government, whose deceit in hiding a previously secret uranium enrichment facility was revealed several weeks ago, and whose support of Hezbollah and other terrorists and declarations of genocidal intent toward Israel are notorious. When we read the State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices--I will attach the Iran summary as an addendum--we should keep in mind that all these outrages and atrocities Ahmadinejad and his cronies commit on their own citizens are more evidence of the aggression Ahmadinejad and his cronies are fully prepared and preparing to commit on Israel, toward whom they don't even pretend to have anything other than the most malevolent intent.  As former Senators Coats and Robb and General Wald wrote in the Washington Post on September 21: ``By ratcheting up pressure on Iran before we sit down, Western negotiators would gain both sticks (additional measures) and carrots (repealing sanctions) with which to induce Iranian cooperation.''  This is exactly right: the time to move this bill is now, before the administration opens its talks with the Ahmadinejad government. This House is ready to send a clear signal to the Iranian regime--that, though our President is negotiating, this country has not weakened one bit its fundamental commitment to defend Israel, that we will not tolerate nuclear threats to Israel, and we will not permit the Ahmadinejad government to obtain nuclear weapons.  Madam Speaker, I urge you and Chairman Berman to move this bill, which now has over 325 co-sponsors, to the floor for passage by the full House as soon as possible. The bill is right, and the time is right.                   2008 Country Reports, Iran Summary       The government's poor human rights record worsened, and it      continued to commit numerous serious abuses. The government      severely limited citizens' right to change their government      peacefully through free and fair elections. The government      executed numerous persons for criminal convictions as      juveniles and after unfair trials. Security forces were      implicated in custodial deaths and committed other acts of      politically motivated violence, including torture. The      government administered severe officially sanctioned      punishments, including death by stoning, amputation, and      flogging. Vigilante groups with ties to the government      committed acts of violence. Prison conditions remained poor.      Security forces arbitrarily arrested and detained      individuals, often holding them incommunicado. Authorities      held political prisoners and intensified a crackdown against      women's rights reformers, ethnic minority rights activists,      student activists, and religious minorities. There was a lack      of judicial independence and fair public trials. The      government severely restricted civil liberties, including      freedoms of speech, expression, assembly, association,      movement, and privacy, and it placed severe restrictions on      freedom of religion. Official corruption and a lack of      government transparency persisted. Violence and legal and      societal discrimination against women, ethnic and religious      minorities, and homosexuals; trafficking in persons; and      incitement to anti-Semitism remained problems. The government      severely restricted workers' rights, including freedom of      association and the right to organize and bargain      collectively, and arrested numerous union organizers. Child      labor remained a serious problem. On December 18, for the      sixth consecutive year, the UN General Assembly (UNGA)      adopted a resolution on Iran expressing ``deep concern at      ongoing systematic violations of human rights.''                          ____________________
