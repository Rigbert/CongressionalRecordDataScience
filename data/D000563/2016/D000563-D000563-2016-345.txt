President, I would like to take a few minutes to talk about an extraordinary person who passed away on Monday, March 7, at the age of 92. Dr. Quentin Young was a dedicated physician and an advocate for civil rights in Chicago.  Some of Dr. Quentin's patients included the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., the Beatles, Studs Terkel, the late Mayor Harold Washington, and even President Obama.  Dr. Young's commitment to the common good is what makes him a legend. He spent 35 years at Cook County Hospital and 56 years of private practice in Hyde Park improving health care while fighting for social justice and racial equality. His autobiography is titled, ``Everybody In, Nobody Out: Memoirs of a Rebel Without a Pause.'' And he meant it.  Doctor Quentin Young grew up in Hyde Park in Chicago's Southside. And when America entered World War II, he enlisted in the Army and served his country honorably.  After returning from the war, Dr. Young graduated from medical school at Northwestern University and would go on to spend 35 years at Cook County Hospital treating patients and becoming a moral voice during the Civil Rights era. When people outside of Chicago hear the words Cook County and hospital, people think about the show ``ER'' and doctors resembling George Clooney. For the people in Chicago, they think of Dr. Quentin Young.  Dr. Young's experience at Cook County Hospital and his efforts during the Civil Rights movement were intertwined. In 1951, he was a founder of the Committee to End Discrimination in Chicago Medical Institutions, which focused on ending racist practices in Chicago's hospitals and clinics.  By 1960, the Cook County Hospital was serving the Black community and immigrant Mexican community almost exclusively. Eighty percent of Chicago's Black births and nearly half of all Black deaths were at Cook County Hospital. This place was one of the frontlines of social inequality and Dr. Young and his family fought to change that. His efforts were not limited to the Chicagoland area. Dr. Young was a founder and national chairman of the Medical Committee for Human Rights or MCHR, which formed in June 1964 to offer support and medical care for civil rights workers, community activists, and summer volunteers working in Mississippi during the Freedom Summer.  It was the MCHR that provided help and emergency medical care to anti-war protesters at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. In October of that year, Dr. Young received a summons by the House Un-American Activities Committee for his involvement in MCHR. He valiantly defended the MCHR's work.  After Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., was struck in the head by a rock while marching through a White neighborhood, Dr. Young was there to patch him up. He was not only Dr King's physician but a fellow marcher during the Marquette Park protest in 1966.  Dr. Young and the late Dr. Jorge Prieto, former head of the Chicago Board of Health, became the primary force behind the movement to found neighborhood medical clinics in the late 1960s. These clinics gave medical help to countless people when they couldn't afford to go to the doctor.  From 1972 to 1981, he served as chairman of Medicine at Cook County Hospital. His example helped bring many dedicated people back to the hospital, but it wasn't without challenges. The staff went on strike because of the lack of resources in 1975. Dr. Young sided with the young doctors, and the governing commission fired him for it. With loyalty, the striking staff took his office door off its hinges so management couldn't change the locks and held a 24-hour vigil outside his office until he regained his position after a court fight.  In 1980, Dr. Young founded the Chicago-based and Illinois-focused Health & Medicine Policy Research Group, which conducts research, education, policy development, and advocacy for policies that impact health systems to improve the health status of all people. He would go on to serve as Mayor Harold Washington's appointment as president to the Chicago Board of Health.  Dr. Quentin Young never lost his passion for providing equal access to health care for the people of Illinois. Since retiring from private practice in 2008, he fought hard for a single-payer system.  In 2001, at the age of 78, he walked 167 miles across Illinois, from Mississippi River to Lake Michigan, with former Governor Pat Quinn to promote access to health care.  He never wavered in his belief in humanity's ability and responsibility to make a more equal and just nation. My prayers and thoughts go out to his family, Michael, Ethan, Nancy, Polly, Barbara, William, Karen, and his nine grandchildren.                          ____________________
