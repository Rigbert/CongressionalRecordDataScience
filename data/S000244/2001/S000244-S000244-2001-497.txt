Speaker, today I am introducing legislation to extend to the principal campaign committee of state and local candidates for elective public office the same graduated tax rates which apply to the principal campaign committee of a candidate for Congress.  In running for Congress, Members of the House are made aware of the Section 527 tax laws that apply to congressional campaign committees. What many Members of Congress may not be aware of is the unfair tax treatment of campaign committees for state and local candidates. Recently, state representatives from my home state of Wisconsin brought to my attention the burdensome tax laws involving the graduated tax rates applicable to interest bearing accounts for state and local campaign committees. Under current law, the tax rate applied to the interest earned by a campaign committee is determined by which office the candidate seeks. State and local candidates are forced to pay a 35% tax rate while congressional candidates pay only 15% on interest bearing accounts for their primary campaign committees.  That is why I am introducing the State and Local Candidate Fairness Act. This legislation would allow state and local candidates to paythe same tax rate as congressional candidates on interest bearing accounts for their campaign committees.  As we are asking our state and local officials to build better and safer communities, we should be encouraging more involvement from our citizens and not discouraging them from participating in state or local government.  By addressing unfair tax burdens on state candidates, my legislation would also help to simplify the tax code. By making the tax rates the same for state and local candidates as they are for congressional candidates, the tax code will in a small way become simpler for everyone running for office. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to fight against unfair tax rates for candidates for state and local office.                          ____________________
