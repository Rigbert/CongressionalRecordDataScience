President, I first wish to thank the chairman of the Rules Committee, the Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for his cooperation in moving forward with such an extremely important matter. Because of its significance, I think it would be useful for us to engage in a colloquy to enlighten the Senate further as to the intent of this resolution.  It is my understanding that the purpose of this resolution is to clarify that individuals with disabilities who have been given the privilege of access to the Senate floor under rule XXIII of the Standing Rules of the Senate may bring necessary supporting aids or services onto the floor. This will ensure that the staff of a Senator wishes to have on the floor will not be denied the privilege of the floor because the staffer happens to use a guide dog or a wheelchair. This resolution is intended to be broadly interpreted to cover all individuals with disabilities. Is my understanding correct that this is the purpose of the resolution?
