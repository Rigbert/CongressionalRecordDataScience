 President, I rise today to introduce legislation that lifts the unfair limits on how much people can save in their employer's pension plan. I have been an advocate of increasing the amount of public education we provide to people on the importance of saving for retirement. However, we also must take more tangible action that will help workers achieve a more secure retirement.  The legislation I am introducing today amends two provisions in the Internal Revenue Code which discourage workers and employers from putting money into pension plans. One of the most burdensome provisions in the Internal Revenue Code is the 25 percent limitation contained within section 415(c). Under 415(c), total contributions by employer and employee into a defined contribution (DC) plan are limited to 25 percent of compensation or $30,000 for each participant, whichever is less. That limitation applies to all employees. If the total additions into a DC plan exceed the lesser of 25 percent or $30,000, the excess money will be subject to income taxes and a penalty in some cases.  The second tax code provision affected by this legislation is section 404(a)(3). This section regulates the amount of retirement plan contributions an employer can deduct for tax purposes. We need this change because those deduction limits are impacted by how much the employee puts into the retirement plan. If we are successful in changing 415(c), we run the risk of more employers bumping into the 15% deduction limit--we don't want that to happen.  To illustrate the need for elimination of the 25 percent limit let me use an example. Bill works for a medium size company in my home state of Iowa. His employer sponsors a 401(k) plan and a profit sharing plan to help employees save for retirement. Bill makes $25,000 a year and elects to put in 10 percent of his compensation into the 401(k) plan, which amounts to $2,500 per year. His employer will match the first 5 percent of his compensation, which comes out to be $1,250, into the 401(k) plan. Therefore, the total 401(k) contribution into Bill's account in this year is $3,750. In this same year Bill' s employer determines to set aside a sufficient amount of his profits to the profit sharing plan which results in an allocation to Bill's account in the profit sharing plan the sum of $3,205. This brings the total contribution into Bill's retirement plan this year up to $6,955.  Unfortunately, because of the 25 percent of compensation limitation only $6,250 can be put into Bill's account for the year. The amount intended for Bill's account exceeds that limitation by $705. Hence, the profit sharing plan administrator must reduce the amount intended for allocation to Bill's account by $705 in order to avoid a penalty. Bill is unlikely to be able to save $705, a significant amount that would otherwise be yielding a tax deferred income which would increase the benefit Bill will receive at retirement. Bill's retirement saving is shortchanged by $705 plus the tax-deferred earnings it would have generated.  Now let's look at Irene. Irene works for the same company, but she makes $45,000 a year. She also puts in 10 percent of her compensation into the 401(k) plan, and her employer matches five percent of her salary into the account. That brings the combined contribution of Irene and her employer up to $6,750. She would also receive a contribution of $3,205 from the profit sharing plan. This brings the total contribution into Irene's pension plan for that year to $9,955. She is also subject to the 25 percent limit, but for Irene, her limit would not be reached until$11,200. She is able to put in her 10 percent, receive the five percent match and receive the full amount from the profit share because her amount doesn't exceed the limit.  Despite the fact that Bill and Irene have the same discipline to add to their pension plans and save for their retirements, Bill is penalized by the 25 percent limitation. By lifting the 25 percent limit, we can provide a higher threshold of savings for those who need it most.  Permitting additional contributions to DC plans will help those working now, particularly women, to ``catch up'' on their retirement savings goals. Women are more likely to live out the last years of their retirement in poverty for a number of reasons. Women have longer lifespans, they are more likely to leave the workforce to raise children or care for elderly parents, are more likely to have to use assets to pay for long-term care for an ill spouse, and traditionally make less money than their male counterparts. Anyone who has delayed saving for retirement will get a much needed boost to their retirement savings strategy if the 25 percent limit is eliminated for employees.  Not only does this proposal help individual employees save for retirement but it also helps the many businesses, both small and large which are affected by 415(c). First, the 25 percent limitation causes equity concerns within businesses. Low and mid-salary workers do not feel as if the Code treats them equitably, when their higher-paid supervisor is permitted to save more in dollar terms in a tax-qualified pension plan.  Second, one of the primary reasons businesses offer pension plans is to reduce turnover and retain employees. Employers often supplement their 401(k) plans with generous matches or a profit-sharing plan to keep people on the job. The 415(c) limitation inhibits their ability to do that, particularly for the lower-paid workers who are unfairly affected.  Third, this legislation will ease the administrative burdens connected with the 25 percent limitation. Dollar limits are easier to track than percentage limits.  Finally, I want to placate any concerns that repealing the 25 percent limit will serve as a windfall for high-paid employees. The Code contains other limitations which provide protection against abuse. First, the Code limits the amount an employee can defer to a 401(k) plan. Under section 402(g) of the Code, workers can only defer up to $10,000 of compensation into a 401(k) plan in 1998. In addition, plans still must meet strict non-discrimination rules that ensure that benefits provided to highly-compensated employees are not overly generous.  The value to society of this proposal, if enacted, is undeniable. Increased savings in qualified retirement plans can prevent leakage, meaning the money is less likely to be spent, or cashed out as might happen in a savings account or even an IRA.  There will be those out there who recognize that this bill does not address the impact of the 415 limit for all of the plans that are subject to it. I have included language that would provide relief to 401(k) plans and 403(b) plans, for example. Plans authorized by section 457 of the Code--used by state and local governments and non-profit organizations have not been specifically addressed. I want to assure organizations who sponsor 457 plans that I support ultimate conformity for all plans affected by the 415(c) percentage limitation. Over the next couple of weeks, I hope to work with these organizations to identify the changes that are necessary to achieve equity and simplicity for their employees. In the mean time, this is a positive step toward enhancing the retirement savings opportunities of working Americans.  We have begun to educate all Americans about the importance of saving for retirement, but if we educate and then do not give them the tools to allow people to practically apply that knowledge, we have failed in our ultimate goal to increase national savings. Let's help Americans succeed in saving for retirement. In helping them achieve their retirement goals, they help us to achieve our goal as policymakers of improving the quality of life for Americans.  I want to thank an Iowa company, IPSCO, in Camanche, Iowa, and its many employees for bringing this issue to the forefront. I would also ask unanimous consent that a letter supporting this legislation from the Profit Sharing Council of America be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                             Profit Sharing/401(k)                                           Council of America,                                    Chicago, IL, January 19, 1999.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Grassley: On behalf of the 1,200 Profit      Sharing/401(k) Council of America members who sponsor      employer-provided retirement plans, I am pleased to announce      our strong support of The Enhanced Savings Opportunity Act,      introduced today, that would repeal the IRC section 415(c) 25      percent of compensation limit currently imposed on employees      participating in defined contribution plans. That limitation      caps the combined employee and employer contribution into a      401(k) account to 25 percent of an employee's earnings. The      25 percent limitation has significantly reduced the ability      of lower-paid employees, specifically intermittent workers,      from taking full advantage of defined contribution retirement      programs. Most companies limit the percentage of pay that an      employee can contribute to their 401(k) plan to even less      than 25 percent in order to insure compliance with 415(c).       The legislation will promote a conducive environment for      expanding the savings opportunities in employer-provided      retirement programs by removing one of the impediments that      prevents employees, especially lower-paid employees, from      taking full advantage of profit sharing, 401(k), and other      defined contribution programs.       The Enhanced Savings Opportunity Act will permit employees      who leave and reenter the workforce, many of whom are women,      to make larger contributions when they are working, in effect      allowing them to ``catch up'' their contributions. All low-     paid employees will now be allowed to defer up to $10,000 of      their wages into a 401(k) plan. Also, companies will be      permitted to make more generous matching and profit sharing      contributions to their employees, especially their lower-paid      employees.       We continue to benefit from your strong leadership in      support of employer-provided retirement plans and again      commend you for this new proposed legislation.           Sincerely,                                                    David L. Wray,                                                        President.
