I rise today to express my support for our former colleague Chuck Hagel to be America's 24th Secretary of Defense. We hoped Chuck Hagel would have been named Secretary of Defense 2 weeks ago and could have led the delegation to Brussels last week to meet with our NATO partners on the challenges we face in Afghanistan and around the world.  Instead, he was subjected to a rare and historic filibuster by the other side of the aisle. What a way to give an opportunity to a man of Chuck Hagel's background to serve our Nation. What we have seen over the past 2 weeks is the cost of apostasy, the cost of breaking with a party, or a leadership, and what it means when their name comes up again for consideration.
