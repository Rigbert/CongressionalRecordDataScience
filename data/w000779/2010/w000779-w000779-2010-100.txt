President, I ask unanimous consent that the agreement be modified to include the Wyden-Grassley amendment No. 4019 to finally end secret holds and add that amendment to the list of amendments included in the agreement.  I point out that last Thursday, the Wyden-Grassley amendment was pending to the financial reform bill, and it was ready for a vote by the Senate. Then at the last minute, out of nowhere, this bipartisan effort was blindsided without any notice whatever by a second-degree amendment that effectively prevented a vote to open government and end secret holds.  In light of what happened, I think it is only fair that this bipartisan amendment be given the opportunity for a vote as part of this consent agreement.  I also wish to make it clear that, in my view, anyone who objects to adding the bipartisan Wyden-Grassley amendment to this agreement is objecting to ending secret holds. They are objecting to even have a vote in the Senate on ending secret holds, therefore, allowing the Senate to continue to operate in secret and against ending this indefensible denial of the public's right to know.  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the agreement be modified to add the Wyden-Grassley amendment to end secret holds, and it is No. 4019.
