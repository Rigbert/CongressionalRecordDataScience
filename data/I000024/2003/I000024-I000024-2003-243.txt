President, I very much look forward to seeing the fruits of the Clinton and Bush administrations' labors on this issue.  From my tenure as chairman of the Senate's Clean Air Subcommittee, I knew that New Source Review was a major issue for the energy sector. In fact, I held the very first congressional hearings on New Source Review in February of 2000 in Ohio. I could not believe my own ears. We heard from companies that were trying to make environmentally friendly modifications to their facilities being stopped dead in their tracks by, ironically, the Clean Air Act.  I was also shocked to hear that it took 4,000 pages of guidance documents to explain 20 pages of regulations. That is 4,000 pages of guidance documents just to explain 20 pages of regulations.  Since then, my shock at the absurdity of the NSR Program has not worn off. We, as a nation, need to rethink the manner in which we approach regulations. We all need to keep an open mind during the debates on various regulatory reform initiatives. I am sick of continually hearing that these are ``sneak attacks on the environment.'' In fact, just the opposite is true. If we rethink regulation, we could find ourselves in a place where we can have far greater environmental protection and more reliable and diverse energy sources.  Congress and the executive branch must also do a better job of understanding how the various layers of regulations impact sectors of our economy. I normally have a chart which shows all of the different regulations that are going to be hitting the various regulated sectors--a chart that shows the refiners that are currently working at almost 100-percent capacity are going to be simultaneously hit with a number of regulations in the next few years. NSR will make it close to impossible for refiners to make these environmental upgrades. Now is the time to work together on these and other regulations to not only achieve the environmental goals but also ensure no disruption in fuel supply which would cause the price spikes that we know are inevitable.  Higher energy prices affect everyone. However, when the price of energy rises, that means the less fortunate in our society must make a decision between heating their home and keeping the lights on or paying for other essential needs.  During a recent EPW Committee hearing last year, Senator Voinovich's constituent, Tom Mullen, articulated this concern. Mr. Mullen stated that in a recent study--which is well known and very well expected--on Public Opinion on Poverty, it was reported that 23 percent of the people in America have difficulty paying for their utilities. That is one out of every four Americans.  I will not support policies, such as NSR, that will hurt the poor in Oklahoma and around the Nation. Additionally, the lower environmental performance resulting from the current NSR Program impacts Americans in every tax bracket. NSR reforms enjoy the support of a wide range of interests--from the State attorneys general to labor unions to business groups.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers in support of NSR reform.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                               Chamber of Commerce                              of the United States of America,                                    Washington, DC, July 15, 2002.     Hon. James Inhofe,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Inhofe: I am writing on behalf of the U.S.      Chamber of Commerce (U.S. Chamber), the world's largest      business federation, representing more than three million      businesses and organizations of every size, sector, and      region, to express our support for reform of the new source      review (NSR) program. NSR, in its current form has impeded      environmental progress and energy production for decades. The      revisions recently announced by the U.S. Environmental      Protection Agency (EPA) are a good beginning to reforming a      deeply flawed program.       The NSR program concerns the Clear Air Act (CAA) emissions      standards applicable to significant new and modified      stationary sources. In 1980, EPA established a regulatory      exclusion for ``routine maintenance.'' The scope of this      term, however, remains subject to debate. A clear      administrative interpretation of ``routine maintenance''      would be an improvement over the present situation, which is      mired in complexity and confusion.       Reducing the problems with the NSR program is vital.      Governments should not unnecessary impede the work of the      private sector. The NSR program is a classic example of      bureaucratic complexity. More than 20 years after the initial      regulation, a plant manager cannot determine with any      certainty whether planned maintenance activities will subject      the facility to millions of dollars of extra costs.       The NSR program, as presently constituted, is a severe      impediment to increasing domestic energy supply. Electric      generating plants cannot make even minor changes in to their      operations without running the risk of ruinous enforcement      actions that would impose huge fines and enormous compliance      costs on their facility. National energy policy, indeed      national security, requires the removal of every obstacle to      increased domestic energy production.       The National Energy Policy Report directed EPA to review      the NSR program, and report on its effect on environmental      protection and energy production. EPA's review found that the      NSR program has impeded or resulted in the cancellation of      projects that would maintain or improve reliability,      efficiency, or safety of existing power plants and      refineries.       On June 13, 2002, EPA announced a set of revisions to the      NSR program. Among other changes, facilities would be able to      make physical changes to their plants without obtaining an      NSR permit, if their emissions do not exceed a plantwide cap.      Projects would be excluded from NSR requirements if they      result in a net overall reduction of air pollutants. EPA      would also establish a safe harbor test. Projects whose      aggregate costs are below the threshold established by the      safe harbor test would be exempt from NSR requirements.       These proposals promise a major improvements to the NSR      program. They will lead to improvements in the environment,      as regulatory certainty will allow facilities to perform      routine maintenance and repairs without the fear of      triggering NSR requirements. Plants have deferred routine      maintenance, which would have improved safety and decreased      emissions, due to the potential costs of NSR requirements.      With the NSR program modifications, overall emissions will be      reduced. The reforms, particularly the plantwide cap, will      benefit facilities by allowing increased operational      flexibility. The revised NSR program will simplify an overly      complex program.       The recently announced NSR reforms are log overdue. The      regulations to be made final later this year were proposed in      1996. The proposals requiring notice and comment rulemaking      will not be in effect until 2004, at the earliest.       The U.S. Chamber supports reform of the NSR program. The      U.S. Chamber urges the Senate to encourage these efforts to      improve environmental progress and energy production.           Sincerely,                                              R. Bruce Josten,                                         Executive Vice President,     Government Affairs.                                  ____      Statement of Ande Abbott, Director, Legislative Department,   International Brotherhood of Boilermakers on the New Source Review                                 Program       Chairman Jeffords, Chairman Leahy, and members of the      Committees, my name is Ande Abbott and I am the Director of      Legislation for the International Brotherhood of      Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and      Helpers, AFL-CIO. I thank you for this opportunity to present      our views.       Commonly referred to as the Boilermakers Union, we are a      diverse union representing over 100,000 workers throughout      the United States and Canada in construction, repair,      maintenance, manufacturing, professional emergency medical      services, and related industries. Boilermakers, who make and      maintain industrial boilers and the pollution control      equipment they use, have had a long-time commitment to a      clear, effective and reasonable new source review (``NSR'')      policy. We support the recent efforts of this Administration      to clarify the program. The efficiency of our facilities and      the safety of our workers hang in the balance.       First, let me be clear today that Boilermakers do not      oppose the Clean Air Act, nor do we oppose its rigorous      enforcement. In fact, construction lodges of our union look      forward to doing much of the actual work for the installation      of new technologies and controls at utility plants and for      industrial boilers across this region and the country. In      reference to the NOX control program alone, our      international President Charlie Jones recently wrote:       ``The EPA estimates that compliance measures will cost      about $1.7 billion a year. A sizable portion of that money      will go to the Boilermakers who do the work necessary to make      the additions and modifications required by the SCR      technology.''       Aside from NOX control, Boilermakers have always      led the way on Clean Air Act issues. For example,      Boilermakers were pioneers in installation of scrubbers and      further in fuel-substitution programs at our cement kiln      facilities. In short, Boilermakers have been there to meet      the challenges of the Clean Air Act, to the benefit our      members and all Americans that breathe clean air.       However, Boilermakers could not support the EPA's 1999      recent interpretation of its authority under the New Source      Review program. NSR, correctly interpreted as we believe the      Administration's clarification does, forces new sources or      those undergoing major modifications, to install new      technology, like the technology President Jones mentioned. We      support NSR in that context.       But, when NSR is applied to the routine maintenance      policies and schedules of existing facilities, very different      results occur. In those cases, facilities are discouraged      from undertaking routine actions for fear of huge penalties      or long delays or both. By applying NSR in that way, we are      pretty sure that Boilermakers won't have the opportunity to      work on maintenance projects that we know are extremely      important to energy efficiency. Just hearing about recent      events in California is enough to make the case that      facilities need to be as efficient as possible. We now have      read that New York may be facing similar problems. The New      York Times reported just a few days ago that, the State ``is      unexpectedly facing the potential for serious power shortages      over the next couple of months.'' Now is definitely not the      time to play with the reliability of a power grid.       Efficiency is not the only reason to encourage routine      maintenance. Experienced professionals or Boilermakers new to      the trade can both tell you: maintenance is necessary to      maintain worker safety. Electric generating facilities      harness tremendous forces: superheater tubes exposed to flue      gases over 2000 degrees; boilers under deteriorating      conditions; and parts located in or around boilers subjected      to both extreme heat and pressure. Any EPA interpretation      which creates incentives to delay maintenance is simply      unacceptable to our workers.       Some critics of the June 13 action by the Administration      have contended that the NSR decision was made with      insufficient attention to public process. This simply has not      been the experience of the Boilermakers or other unions      working on this project. The U.S. EPA held four public      hearings in each region of the country. Paul Kern, the      recording secretary of our Local 105 in Piketon, Ohio,      offered a statement at the hearing in Cincinnati. In      addition, it is our understanding that over 130,000      rulemaking comments were received on this initiative. Given      our experience with certain regulations that just seem to      appear over night, the Administration's action NSR seem      pretty open and fair to us. When you compare the current      clarification to the way the program changed in 1999--without      any rulemaking process whatsoever--the Administration's June      13 announcement looks all the better!       Boilermakers are not just workers; they are also consumers      of electricity that work hard for their wages. One item often      lost in the mess regarding NSR is that capital expenditures      not justified for environmental protection are still passed      along to ratepayers. Unfortunately, the less money you make,      the greater the percentage of your paycheck goes to your      electricity bills. According to Energy Information      Administration data, those living at or near the poverty      level pay 4 to 6 times the percentage of their income for      power. So, advocates of misusing the NSR program hurt those      least able to afford it the most!       As you can see, Boilermakers have never asked for repeal or      substantial revision of the NSR program. We encourage the      development and installation of new technology, and we stand      ready to continue to train and apprentice workers to meet the      needs of the Clean Air Act. However, when the NSR programs      goes where it wasn't intended--and discourages the very      maintenance, repair and replacement activities that      constitute the livelihood of Boilermakers--we must strongly      object. Thanks for the opportunity to make a statement.
