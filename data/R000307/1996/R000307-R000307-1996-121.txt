Speaker, I would like to inquire of the Chair, in terms of the requirement of reading what is contained in the motion to recommit, it is my understanding there are 229 pages of the proposal. We have not seen these 229 pages. Could the Chair inform me if, in fact, there are 229 pages and was the Clerk going to read all 229?
