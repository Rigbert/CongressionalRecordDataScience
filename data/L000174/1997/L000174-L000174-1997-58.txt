In fact, these Republicans are shocked that some Senators have attacked Ms. Morrow. For example, Sheldon H. Sloan, a former president of the Los Angeles County Bar Association and an associate of Gov. Pete Wilson, declared that: ``My party has the wrong woman in their sights.''  Stephen S. Trott, a former high-ranking official in the Reagan administration and now a Court of Appeals judge wrote to the majority leader to try to free up the Morrow nomination, according to this article Judge Trott informed Senator Lott.       I know that you are concerned, and properly so, about the      judicial philosophy of each candidate to the federal bench.      So am I. I have taken the oath, and I know what it means:      follow the law, don't make it up to suit your own purposes.      Based on my own long acquaintance with Margaret Morrow, I      have every confidence she will respect the limitations of a      judicial position.  Robert Bonner, the former head of DEA under a Republican administration, observed in the article that: ``Margaret has gotten tangled in a web of larger forces about Clinton nominees. She is a mere pawn in this struggle.'' I could not agree more.  Mr. President, it is time to free the nomination of Margaret Morrow from this tangled web that some extremists are trying to weave. It is time to debate and vote on the nomination of Margaret Morrow.  Mr. President, again, I am pleased we will take up the nomination of Judge James Gwin. But we are, once again, overlooking the nomination of Margaret Morrow. Ms. Morrow's nomination is the longest pending judicial nomination on the Senate Calendar, and is strongly supported by both Republicans and Democrats. The Senate ought to have the courage and the honesty to either vote for her or against her.               [From the Los Angeles Times, Nov. 3, 1997]                               Exhibit 1           Bipartisan Support Not Enough for Judicial Nominee(U.S. Senate: Margaret Morrow's appointment is stalled despite backing across political spectrum. Some say she is victim of effort to downsize                                 courts)                          (By Henry Weinstein)       If ever there was an unlikely candidate to be the target      for a militant campaign against ``judicial activism,'' it      would be Los Angeles lawyer Margaret Mary Morrow.       An honors graduate of Harvard Law School, 47, was the first      female president of the California Bar Assn., where she      worked to strengthen the state's attorney discipline system.       A commercial litigation specialist, Morrow is a partner in      the Los Angeles office of Arnold & Porter, one of the most      venerable firms based in the nation's capital. Her clients      have included First Interstate Bank, McDonnell Douglas, TWA      and The Limited.       President Clinton, on the recommendation of Sen. Barbara      Boxer (D-Calif.), tapped Morrow for a federal trial judgeship      in May 1996. She quickly won bipartisan support--including      endorsements from judges appointed by presidents Ronald      Reagan and George Bush and governors George Deukmejian and      Pete Wilson.       ``Margaret is superbly well qualified,'' said Los Angeles      lawyer Robert C. Bonner, who has served as a federal judge      and head of the Drug Enforcement Administration during Bush's      presidency.       She also received the highest possible rating--``very well      qualified''--from the American Bar Assn.'s judicial      evaluation committee. By late 1996, after a perfunctory      hearing, Morrow cleared the committee unanimously. But the      nomination died, along with several others in the      congressional slowdown that inevitably occurs in election      years.       Clinton renominated Morrow on Jan. 7. Within three weeks,      trouble emerged and her nomination remains in limbo even      though she was approved a second time on June 12 by the      Judiciary Committee, whose chairman, Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah),      said in late September that he would push for a swift vote      and support her.       Much to the surprise of her backers, particularly her      Republican supporters, Morrow has become the subject of the      sort of intense partisan attacks generally reserved for      nominees with a long record of activism such as civil rights      lawyer Thurgood Marshall or a trail of controversial      decisions such as Judge Robert Bork.       Indeed, the story of Morrow's confirmation battle is in      significant measure a tale about the fissures within the      Republican Party about judicial nominations.       One conservative federal judge, speaking on condition of      not being identified, said that, in reality, the campaign      against Morrow has nothing to do with her qualifications or      her views, but rather is part of a ``conscious plan to      downsize'' the federal courts in the western United States      with the goal of remaking them after Clinton's presidency      ends.       Echoed Bonner: ``Margaret has gotten tangled in a web of      larger forces about Clinton nominees. She is a mere pawn in      this struggle.''       The campaign against Morrow began with a Jan. 28 op-ed      piece in The Washington Times by Thomas L. Jipping, director      of the militantly conservative Free Congress Foundation's      Judicial Selection Monitoring Project.       Jipping contended that Morrow was likely to become an      ``activist judge,'' who improperly would attempt to legislate      a political agenda from the bench. Soon, Republican senators      John Ashcroft of Missouri and Jeff Sessions of Alabama, both      staunch conservatives, new members of the Judiciary Committee      and Jipping allies, joined the attack.       Since that time, Morrow has been back to the committee for      another hearing and answered three sets of questions in      writing--including highly unusual questions about her      positions on many California ballot initiatives during the      past 10 years. She also told the committee she would adhere      strictly to precedents and would have no problem applying the      death penalty.       Last Wednesday, the effort to derail Morrow's nomination      escalated. Ashcroft and Sessions announced that they would      spearhead further opposition to Morrow and said more than 100      ``grassroots'' organizations, including the National Rifle      Assn. and the Traditional Values Coalition, had joined the      campaign against her.       The coalition was assembled while Ashcroft had placed ``a      hold'' on the nomination, which under Senate protocol had      prevented it from coming to the floor for a vote. On      Wednesday, at a news conference announcing the coalition, he      said he now favors a roll-call vote.       Ashcroft and Sessions pointedly reminded their colleagues      that several organizations in the coalition would be      ``scoring'' the votes of senators on the nomination.       Morrow's adversaries contend that she would be a ``judicial      activist'' on the bench. ``She views the law as an engine for      social change . . . and as a means of imposing public policy      from the courts on the rest of us,'' Ashcroft asserted.       Morrow declined to respond. ``I do not believe it is      appropriate for me to comment while my nomination is pending      before the Senate,'' she said in a brief telephone interview      at week's end.       Morrow has previously denied such characterizations. For      example, in June 1996, she told the Judiciary Committee: ``I      view the role of a judge as being the resolution of disputes      that come before . . . him or her for resolution. So I would      look to the facts of the case. I would attempt to apply the      law as I understand it to those facts. And I would not seek      to expand them or otherwise to use any particular case as a      reason for articulating new constitutional rights or      otherwise expanding what I understand to be the existing      law.''       Boxer and Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the ranking minority      member on the Judiciary Committee, came to Morrow's defense      last week. Boxer described her as ``the epitome of      mainstream'' and Leahy charged that a coalition of      conservative activists is using Morrow as ``a fund-raising      vehicle'' for their campaign to reduce the power of      federal judges.       Perhaps more importantly, several staunch Republicans said      the accusations against Morrow are ludicrous. ``My party has      the wrong woman in their sights,'' declared Sheldon H. Sloan,      former president of the Los Angeles County Bar Assn. and a      close ally of Wilson. ``There is no flag burning for Margaret      Morrow,'' said Sloan, describing the nominee as both an      outstanding lawyer and ``a church-going, basketball mom.''       A large number of prominent Republicans have backed the      nominee in writing--highlighted by rare letters of support      from three conservative U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals      judges--Pamela A. Rymer, Cynthia Holcomb Hall and Stephen S.      Trott, State Supreme Court Justice Marvin R. Baxter and state      appeals court justices Roger Boren, H. Walter Croskey and      Charles S. Vogel, all appointed by Republican governors, also      have weighed in on Morrow's behalf, as have Los Angeles Mayor      Richard Riordan, then-state     Assembly Majority Leader James E. Rogan of Glendale and      Orange County Dist. Att. Michael R. Capizzi.       In an effort to unclog the nomination, Trott, who earlier      served as a high-ranking official in the Justice Department      under President Reagan, recently wrote to Senate Majority      Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.).       ``I know you are concerned, and properly so, about the      judicial philosophy of each candidate to the federal bench.      So am I. I have taken the oath, and I know what it means:      follow the law, don't make it up to suit your own purposes.      Based on my own long acquaintance with Margaret Morrow, I      have every confidence she will respect the limitations of a      judicial position.''       In their letters, some of Morrow's backers have sought to      clearly establish their bona fides with conservative      senators.       ``I am a lifelong Republican from Orange County,      California,'' Costa Mesa attorney Andrew J. Guilford wrote      Hatch. ``I have never voted for a Democrat in any      presidential campaign. . . . I did not believe Anita Hill, I      am happy that Justice Clarence Thomas is on our Supreme Court      and I regret that [Robert] Bork is not on our Supreme Court.      It is partly my concern over the unfair destruction of Judge      Bork's judicial career that causes me to enthusiastically      endorse Margaret Morrow.''       Backers of Morrow cite her intellect, character and record      of public service. As president of the Los Angeles County Bar      Assn., she instituted a voluntary program urging attorneys to      provide at least 35 hours of free legal services yearly for      the poor. And she was a member of the commission that drafted      an ethics code for Los Angeles city government.       Morrow's advocates also assert that her speeches and      writings have been distorted beyond recognition by her foes,      particularly one sentence in a 1988 article on the initiative      process that is cited as prime evidence of her ``activist''      proclivities.       In the Los Angeles Lawyer magazine article, Morrow wrote:      ``The fact that initiatives are presented to a `legislature'      of 20 million people renders ephemeral any real hope of      intelligent voting by a majority.''       The article was written in the wake of one of the most      expensive initiative campaigns in state history, highlighted      by five complicated measures dealing with insurance and      attorney's fees. At the time, many charged that that      television advertising about the measures was misleading,      prompting widespread calls for reform.       Morrow's article did not call for abolition of initiatives.      The article noted that use of the initiative had escalated      dramatically in the 1980s, discussed possible reforms of the      initiative and legislative processes and urged lawyers to      play a role in improving government.       Croskey, an appointee of Deukmejian, said he was stunned      that the article was cited as evidence that Morrow would      improperly legislate from the bench.       ``She was making a profound and useful criticism of the      initiative process and how it could be improved,'' Croskey      said. ``To metamorphose that into the conclusion that she is      a judicial activist has no foundation.''       On Friday, Croskey faxed a letter to Lott urging the      senator to bring the nomination to the floor for a vote. But      it seems unlikely that will happen before Congress adjourns      in the next few weeks. Lott, who has the power under Senate      procedure to hold up the nomination indefinitely, said a few      days ago that he felt no pressure to take any action on      judicial nominees during the remainder of the year.       The White House declined to comment last week on Morrow's      nomination.                          ____________________
