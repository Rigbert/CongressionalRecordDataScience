Mr. Speaker, I rise to bring to your attention a terrible injustice. The victims of this injustice are hardworking, taxpaying American citizens who are being deprived of basic rights guaranteed to each citizen under the Constitution. Those rights are the right to due process of law and the right to equal protection of the law. Due process guarantees that when the Government might cause us harm, we should have a right to be heard. Equal protection requires equal treatment before the law.  If the Clinton administration has it's ways, our citizens will be gagged and denied the right to be heard when they want to complain about what their Government is doing to them under the guise of protecting endangered or threatened species.  The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case filed by two ranchers in Oregon asserting that Secretary Babbitt violated the Endangered Species Act [ESA] when he tried to reduce the amount of water available to those ranchers for their cattle and crops. They alleged that he disobeyed several requirements of the ESA that would have protected their economic interests. However, they never got their day in court. Mr. Babbitt's lawyers asked the judge to throw out their claim without a hearing. His lawyers claim that people are not protected by the Endangered Species Act so they have no right to complain when the Secretary violates the act and therefore, takes away their ability to support themselves.  The lawyers argued that people's economic, social or recreational concerns are not within the ``zone of interest'' of the ESA and therefore, they cannot sue to have the Court decide if the Secretary had violated the law.  The judge threw the ranchers out of court, but they appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal. Once again. Secretary Babbitt's attorneys argued that the ranchers could not sue to have the Secretary's actions reviewed by the court, because they have no protections under the ESA. This is called the zone of interest test. The ninth circuit in Bennett v. Plent, 63 F. 3d 915 (1995) agreed with Secretary Babbitt's lawyers and once again threw these ranchers out of court ruling that they were not within ESA's zone of interest. The ranchers have now appealed to the Supreme Court. However, Secretary Babbitt's attorneys are now worried about the political consequences of having everyday people denied access to judicial review of Secretary Babbitt's decisions, so they have quit arguing that these ranchers are not protected by the ESA. Instead, they are still arguing that these ranchers should not be allowed to sue but are basing their arguments on other legal technicalities, such as claiming that the ranchers sued the wrong Government agency within Secretary Babbitt's vast Department. At the Supreme Court level the case is known as Bennett versus Spear.  If the Supreme Court decides the case the way the lawyers have asked them to, it will leave the zone of interest test in place in all courts within the ninth circuit's jurisdiction. This means that people living in California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, Nevada, Arizona, and Montana will not be able to sue under the ESA to have a court review illegal actions by Secretary Babbitt. Since the courts in other areas of the country are not bound by the Ninth Circuit Court's decision, citizens in those areas will not have to pass the zone of interest test to have access to the courts. However, if the Supreme Court agrees with the ninth circuits decision, this zone of interest test will become the law of the land and will have broad legal implications, not just for the interpretation of the Endangered Species Act, but for a variety of other environmental statutes as well.  Putting it in layman's language--Secretary Babbitt's lawyers have opened the door of the courthouse to the environmental lawyers, given them millions of dollars of taxpayers money to pay for their lawsuits, and invited them to keep coming back. This has spawned a cottage industry for so-called environmentalists. Although the Federal Government subsidizes hundreds of environmentalist's lawsuits, they have slammed the door of the courthouse to average citizens just trying to protect themselves from abuses by Secretary Babbitt's Department. I have attached a list of cases filed under the ESA and the attorney's fees received by the lawyers in each of these cases. This list was supplied to the Committee on Resources by the Department of Justice.  To say this is unfair is a gross understatement. It is unfair in the extreme and in addition, it is resulting in unreasonable and unbalanced public policy. It is no secret that Federal judges are playing a key role in implementing the Endangered Species Act. When Secretary Babbitt adopts new rules, he is required by law to receive public comment from any member of the public. When Federal judges interpret the law, they can exclude the general public and allow only a limited viewpoint to be heard. It is no wonder that we end up with judge-made law that is so unbalanced and unreasonable in so many cases.  Not all judges would turn away those citizens who wish to sue to protect their economic, social, or recreational interest. Judge Rosenbaum of the U.S. District Court in Minnesota had this to say when the lawyers representing the Clinton administration asked him to dismiss a suit filed by a group of snowmobilers. He scolded the Government because they could not identify a single person who would have been qualified to complain about the Government's overprotection of endangered species.  Judge Rosenbaum said ``the Court is unwilling to adopt the view that the Fish and Wildlife Service is unrestrained if it cloaks any of its acts in the laudable robe of endangered and threatened species protection. This is a form of totalitarian virtue--a concept for which no precedent has been advanced and which is foreign to the rule of law.''  He apparently does not agree with the Secretary Babbitt's view that under the law the Federal Government can never go too far in protecting endangered species. In briefs to the Supreme Court the Government says that no one can sue them if they go too far under the ESA.  According to the Secretary Babbitt's lawyers, if the Government violates the constitutional and legal rights of citizens, if it fails to follow the requirements in the Endangered Species Act designed to protect citizens right's, there is no citizen who can sue to stop such Government overreaching.  That is an incredible statement by our Justice Department lawyers sworn to uphold our Constitution and our Bill of Rights.  I agree with Judge Rosenbaum that allowing only professional environmentalists to use the ESA to further their agenda, whatever that agenda may be, is foreign to the principles of fairness and due process that we hold so dear.  We need to let citizens who are directly impacted by the ESA into the courthouse so that the courts can hear all the facts, all the evidence, and let the truth guide their decisions. When only one side is allowed to present the facts, the truth becomes the victim of injustice.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                    Suit                                         Attorney fees                     Case name                       number                District                     paid      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1.
