  Mr. DeFAZIO. The Obama administration has steadfastly refused to contest the improper and excessive tariffs of $2.4 billion levied by Mexico because Congress terminated the cross-border trucking program due to serious safety concerns.  There is no drug testing in Mexico. There are no hours of service requirements in Mexico. There are no meaningful commercial driver's licenses issued in Mexico to know what the record of these drivers are. Congress overwhelmingly voted to terminate that program.  But it is rumored that next month when the President of Mexico comes to visit, the Obama administration is going to open the border full bore to Mexican trucks, jeopardizing the safety of the American public and jeopardizing millions of jobs in the trucking industry. They say they have no alternative, their hands are tied by NAFTA. Well, there is an alternative. And today I was joined in a letter to the President by 78 Members of Congress, bipartisan, saying renegotiate that one minor section of NAFTA that has triggered this dispute. Keep the current system.  The Mexican trucks bring the goods in 20 miles, they drop them, the U.S. trucks pick them up and distribute them in the U.S. No U.S. company wants to go into Mexico. And let's keep the Mexican companies out of the U.S.                          ____________________
