Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Paul Gill is one of these individuals. On March 26, 2008, a celebration will be held in honor of Paul Gill's retirement--and of the next chapter in his life of public service as the Chief Operations Officer of Pittsburgh Public Schools.  Paul Gill is the Senior Vice President, Regional Operations, for American Dental Partners, a leading dental practice management services organization. He is responsible for supervising California operations, and building a strong dental network for the West Coast. Since 1993, Paul served as the Administrator for Riverside Dental Group.  Prior to coming to Riverside Dental Group, Paul served as Community Development Director for the City of Moreno Valley. In that capacity, he managed the city activities of Planning, Building, and Code Compliance.  Before his position with the City, Paul served more than 23 years in the United States Air Force, last serving as the Wing Commander at March Air Force Base, California. In the Air Force, Paul served in various commands throughout the country and overseas as a pilot, instructor pilot, evaluator pilot and at various levels of operational staff and command. He has flown approximately 4,000 hours, of which more than 800 were in combat.  Paul has a B.S. degree from Duquesne University, an M.S. from Syracuse University, as well as an M.A. from Creighton University. Among his community activities, he served as Chairman, March Joint Powers Authority Technical Advisory Committee, Director of the Silver Eagles, and the LeMay Foundation. Paul has also served as Chairman of Riverside County's Airport Land Use Commission, Chairman of the Silver Eagles, Director of Riverside County's Regional Hospital Foundation, the Monday Morning Group, and the Moreno Valley Action Committee. He and his wife Mary Anne have four grown children.  Paul's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Riverside, California. I am proud to call Paul a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he retires from the Riverside Dental Group. I wish Paul and his wife all the best as they embark on a new adventure in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. They will be sorely missed.                          ____________________
