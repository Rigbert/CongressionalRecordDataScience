President, I would like to take a moment to pay tribute to a woman who has dedicated her life to battling homelessness in Vermont. Sister Lucille Bonvouloir is the unofficial Patron Saint for the homeless in Burlington, the State's largest city and only Enterprise Community. The Committee on Temporary Shelter [COTS], an organization that she has directed since 1988, provides a range of social services as well as basic shelter to help people who have hit bottom get back on their feet again. As the problem of homelessness in Burlington has grown, so has COTS under Sister Lucille's innovative and capable direction.  In July, Sister Lucille will be taking on new responsibilities as the vice president of the Vermont Regional Sisters of Mercy. While she will be sorely missed and the shoes she leaves behind at COTS are large indeed, the homeless and the needy of Burlington have nothing to fear from the transition. They know as I do that their guardian angel will continue to watch over them and stand up for their needs as she has for so many years. I join them in wishing her the best in her new career.  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the February 7, 1996 Burlington Free Press on Sister Lucille Bonvouloir's life of service to Burlington be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            Sister Bonvouloir To Work With Sisters of Mercy                           (By Mike Donoghue)       A Burlington nun known as a fighter for providing shelter      and vocational training for homeless people said Tuesday that      she would step down in June as head of the largest program      for the Vermont homeless.       Sister Lucille Bonvouloir will leave her post as executive      director of the Committee on Temporary Shelter to become vice      president of the Vermont Regional Sisters of Mercy on July 1.       Sister Bonvouloir and the agency, better known as COTS,      provided services to 1,100 individuals through seven programs      operated in Burlington last year.       The Orwell native said she expects to face new battles when      she becomes part of the team managing the affairs of the 93      Sisters of Mercy serving Vermont. Among the expected scuffles      will be a proposed 93-unit affordable housing development the      sisters hope to build on the north side of Mount St. Mary's      Convent on Mansfield Avenue.       The project will be ideal for single mothers who are      returning to school at nearby Trinity College, she said. It      is opposed by residents who say it is too large for the      neighborhood.       Sister Bonvouloir, 53, has worked for the committee since      1986 and has been its director since June 1988. She helped      expand the programs to meet the needs in the community for      family shelters and vocational training.       When the number of homeless families increased, the COTS      Family Shelter opened on North Champlain Street in 1988. When      there was chronic shortage of affordable housing, COTS      developed St. John's Hall on Elmwood Avenue.       During 1993-94, Sister Lucille improved access to      vocational programs and created a voice mail system in      Burlington to increase employment prospects for those without      phones. Last year, 70 percent of the participants in the      vocational program were placed in full-time jobs.                          ____________________
