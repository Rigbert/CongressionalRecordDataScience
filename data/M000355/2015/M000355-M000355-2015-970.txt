 They wanted to have further time to read the bill. I want everybody to understand that the text is filed, it is at the desk. There are detailed summaries available online on the EPW Committee Web site.  As everyone knows, Senator Boxer, I, and others have been discussing this in great detail.  I am hopeful that by tomorrow we will have cloture on the bill and an opportunity to go forward.  Let me just say to everybody that I know I haven't threatened a Saturday session all year, but there will be a Saturday session and probably Sunday as well. Let me tell you why. We have a chance to achieve a multiyear, bipartisan highway bill. Senator Inhofe and Senator Boxer reported out a 6-year bill. This is a 6-year bill. We have paid for the first 3 years. I believe our colleagues on the other side will find these pay-fors credible. They may not love every single one of them, but there is not a phony one in there.  If we can get this bill over to the House, it is my belief they will take it up. Give the House of Representatives an opportunity to express itself on this bill. Imagine the scenario if we actually were able to produce a multiyear highway bill and get it to the President's desk for signature before the August recess. It is something we could all feel proud of. In my view, there has been outstanding bipartisan work on this, and so we need to keep at it, and that will require us, most definitely, to be here this weekend.                          ____________________
