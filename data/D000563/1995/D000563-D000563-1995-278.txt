 billion, and it not only affects what I have just described, but it also affects mass transit. In the city of Chicago, for example, so many working families get on that mass transit every day to get down to their workplace. It is their only way to do it. They cannot afford to drive and park. They have to take mass transit. Now we are seeing massive cuts in operating assistance. So these communities will see the fare box go up in cost, which means that families struggling now to get by, husbands and wives both working hard trying to make ends meet, have a new added expense because of this decision to cut back on operating assistance. It really raises a question about whether we are helping the right people.  I worry as much as the gentlewoman does that we have to help all of America, but I am particularly concerned about those who are struggling down at the bottom, those forgotten families at the bottom of the economic pyramid, who pay their taxes, play by the rules, and keep falling behind. When we see cuts in operating assistance for mass transit, we are not making it any easier for them to get to work.
