Speaker, I would like to rise this evening on behalf of the people of the State of Ohio to offer our great heartfelt support to our brothers and sisters in the nation of Japan. Every person in the world really is bound with compassion and with hope that we can find a way to help heal the great damage that is occurring there and has occurred. I know that we have over 12 naval vessels that have moved across the Pacific to offer assistance, and nations around the world will try to help the people of Japan.  My message this evening is one of hope to the Japanese people, so many that I have met in my own career, certainly their national leaders in the Diet, in their executives, so many educational leaders, and just the people of Japan who have been so kind to us on our visits there. I hope they know that Japanese Americans living in our country, certainly in Ohio's Ninth District, are bound with them in an attitude of rebuilding and healing.  As the State of Ohio's name mean ``hello,'' we offer tonight a very special hello to the valiant people of Japan.                          ____________________
