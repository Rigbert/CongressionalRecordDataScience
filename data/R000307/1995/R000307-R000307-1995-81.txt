And I would only add at this time, Mr. Chairman, that I would also like to rise in opposition to the Gilchrest amendment.  Now the Gilchrest amendment, in the eyes of the sometimes powerful House Committee on Agriculture and its members, would provide authority to the Federal regulatory community to decide what classifications will be used for various functions and values of wetlands. The gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Hayes] has already spoken to that. I associate myself with his remarks. And to some of these regulators, quite frankly, every wet spot is a valuable wetland. That is the problem. That is the problem with the gentleman's amendment. They will use a seat-of-the-pants science to determine wetlands. I would imagine they would go out in the field, sit down on the ground, and if their pants get damp, why then it would be a wetland.  The Gilchrest amendment eliminates the statutory wetlands delineation process of H.R. 961 which requires land to actually be wet for a significant part of the growing season. The committee bill requires some water-loving plants to be found on the ground.  The gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Gilchrest] would eliminate that requirement. He would eliminate the requirements for how hydric soils are delineated.  In short, I would tell my colleagues that the Gilchrest amendment guts the committee's well-reasoned, commonsense approach and replaces it with a program ruled by those who write the rules, EPA and Fish and Wildlife. That is part of the problem.  We do not need this amendment. The gentleman's intent is good, his leadership is good, he is a fine Member but we should oppose his amendment. Let us get on with the adoption of H.R. 961 and defeat this amendment.
