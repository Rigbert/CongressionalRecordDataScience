Obviously, that was the happy one.  I came to Congress 29 years ago. John Dingell came to Congress 53 years ago. Sally Crowe came to Congress 57 years ago. You may not know Sally Crowe by name, but you know Sally Crowe.  Sally Crowe was the hostess who greeted all of us in the House restaurant. She was a wonderful spirit. She died while we were on break this month. She died after having had a very substantial fall. And others may have retired, as she surely could have. She chose not to retire, however, and she returned to the place that she loved and served so well.  We are all advantaged by those who are not known widely outside this institution, but who served this institution with a devotion to country, devotion to the institution, and devotion to each and every one of us and, in Sally's case, to the guests who came and visited with us and ate with us in the dining room or were visitors here and ate there.  She was courteous, kind, respectful, affectionate. I will remember Sally with great affection. Her family lives in my district.  I want to say on behalf of all of us to her family how much we appreciated her love, her service to us and to her country; and I want to yield to my friend, Zach Wamp of Tennessee.                              {time}  1845
