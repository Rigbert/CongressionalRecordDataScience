 President, can I say very briefly to the Senator from Missouri how much I appreciate his fine addition to this debate and how grateful I am for his leadership on this important issue, as well as the distinguished Senator from Alabama, the current occupant of the Chair. They both understand the issue well and make an important contribution to the debate.
