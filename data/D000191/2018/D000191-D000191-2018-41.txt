Speaker, I rise today regarding missed votes due to a medical issue. Had I been present for rollcall vote No. 237, the Motion to Recommit H.R. 8, I would have voted ``yea.'' Had I been present for rollcall vote No. 238, H.R. 8, the Water Resources Development Act of 2018, I would have voted ``yea.'' Had I been present for rollcall vote No. 239, the Senate Amendment to H.R. 3249, I would have voted ``yea.'                          ____________________
