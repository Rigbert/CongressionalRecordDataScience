President, I rise today in support of Senator Mikulski's amendment to replace the emergency spending and rescission bill the Senate is now considering with a more equitable across-the-board cut. The Appropriations Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs, HUD and Independent Agencies is responsible for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's budget--but it is not and cannot be held responsible for bankrolling disaster assistance.  About half of the cuts in both the House and Senate rescission bills come from programs under the jurisdiction of the VA-HUD Subcommittee. Veterans and lower income Americans should not be asked to foot the bill for California's earthquakes or flooding in the Midwest. The burden of paying for these costly disasters should be shared among all Federal programs--not just [[Page S4772]] those under the jurisdiction of the VA-HUD Subcommittee.  While I support the Mikulski amendment, I would have preferred that the Pentagon chip in. Senator Mikulski's across-the-board cut goes a long way toward bringing some equity to the proposed cuts. Including defense in those cuts would go even further.
