President, I had yielded to the Senator from Connecticut, so let me respond. There are other provisions that arose this morning that no one has seen. It is a new bill. It is a different bill. The Senator may have talked about it in the Commerce Committee. I am not on the Commerce Committee.  I will say this: To receive a bill after months and months of having this bill to look at, preparing our case, only to find out at the last minute, since they obviously didn't have the votes, it was changed, and we received it at 11:53, is not realistic.
