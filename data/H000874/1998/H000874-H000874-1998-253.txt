Speaker, I serve on the Committee on House Oversight. It was said that this legislation was brought to the committee. Let me disabuse any of my colleagues on the theory that this got any kind of thoughtful consideration in committee. It certainly will not receive any thoughtful consideration on the floor under the procedures that have been devised by the majority.  A bill was noticed to the members of the committee less than 24 hours before we marked it up in committee. We met, we offered some substantive amendments; they were rejected on a straight party line vote, and withoutfurther discussion, this bill was adopted. It was supposed to come to the floor this Thursday.  We thought it was going to come to the floor with a motion to recommit so we could have offered McCain-Feingold. However, the Republican majority was even afraid of that procedure, limited though it was, so they have now devised a procedure which will allow not one single suggestion other than that which has been written in the back room by the Republican majority.  What a travesty. Not only will we not get campaign finance reform, but we will have a procedure that will further denigrate the democratic process that this House likes to pride itself on.  Mr. Speaker, I would hope that cooler, more rational heads would prevail, and that the Republican majority would reconsider this shameful process that they are foisting on the American public.                          ____________________
