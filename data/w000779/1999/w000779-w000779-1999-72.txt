We use marketplace forces. We use a dose of free enterprise, how our Federal employee health plan works.  What troubles me is a lot of those other bills focus on an approach of Government purchasing the medicine, but that will shift the costs onto a lot of other people.  I am very fearful that under some of those approaches, particularly the ones in the House, because Medicare essentially would control prices, they will shift the costs. What will happen is an African American woman who is 27, maybe single with a couple of children, will end up with a higher prescription drug bill because that person will end up seeing the costs shifted when prices are controlled just for the Medicare Program.  I think we ought to use marketplace forces, competitive principles. That is what our legislation does. It will prevent cost shifting and help to hold down costs for all Americans.  I yield the floor.
