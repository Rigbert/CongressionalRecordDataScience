Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Just like to say I hope the gentleman asks for a recorded vote. I want the people on record, being recorded they are against the people of the United States being involved in land decisions. They do not let the executive branch be involved in deciding what type of property should be taken off and what private property should be infringed upon. I want to have that vote. I want to see who has the guts to vote against the American people.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Idaho [Mrs. Chenoweth].
