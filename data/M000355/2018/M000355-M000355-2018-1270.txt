Willenberg, Case No.      17M1242, pending in Municipal Court in Colorado Springs,      Colorado, the defendant has requested the production of      testimony from Andrew Merritt, an employee in the office of      Senator Cory Gardner;       Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the      Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C.

The Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to      represent current and former Members, officers, and employees      of the Senate in connection with the production of evidence      authorized in section one of this resolution.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the distinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Schumer, I send to the desk a resolution authorizing the production of testimony and representation by the Senate Legal Counsel, and ask for its immediate consideration.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for testimony in a criminal action pending in Colorado State court. In this action, the defendant is charged with trespass for refusing to leave Senator Gardner's Colorado Springs office. A forthcoming evidentiary hearing and trial is expected to be scheduled shortly in the Municipal Court of Colorado Springs, Colorado.  The defendant in this case is seeking testimony from Andrew Merritt, Senator Gardner's State Director, who was present during some of the events at issue. Senator Gardner would like to cooperate with this request.  The enclosed resolution would authorize the production of testimony from Mr. Merritt and representation by the Senate Legal Counsel of current and former Members, officers, and employees of the Senate.                          ____________________
