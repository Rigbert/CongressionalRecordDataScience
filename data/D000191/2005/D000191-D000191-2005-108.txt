Speaker, well, congratulations are yet again in order to the Bush administration. They hit another milestone just last week. They ran up the 8 trillionth, trillionth dollar of debt in the name of the American people.  The U.S. debt is up 60 percent under the Bush-Cheney watch with the Republicans in charge of Congress, a 60 percent increase in the Federal debt in 5 years. That took some doing. That means every American, from the tiniest baby to the oldest senior citizen, today owes about $27,000. That is a heck of a burden to carry.  And then this year, they are touting the fact that they only have the third largest deficit in history at $312 billion. They are saying, big progress. Of course, they forget to tell you that that does not include borrowing every penny of this year's Social Security surplus of $180 billion, which is only paid for by working people, not the rich who are favored by the tax cuts. Only people who earn less than $94,000 pay Social Security taxes. They are paying $180 billion more than is necessary for the program, with the idea it is being saved.  It is not being saved. This administration is taking that money and spending it, part of it to finance tax cuts for rich people who do not pay Social Security taxes. A great noose on the taxpayers' money.  But now they are born again, right here on the floor in front of us this week, as fiscal conservatives. They say they want to pay for the Katrina disaster, but there is only one way to do it. Cut the tax cuts for the rich people? Oh, no, no, no. Wasteful spending? No. How about, let us go to the programs that are important to average Americans. Health care for seniors: they want to cut Medicare and Medicaid for seniors. Education: kids are already struggling to go to school, but cut education. They would hit at food stamps so they will be more hungry, and maybe cut back on energy assistance in a time of huge price gouging by their friends in the oil, coal, and gas industries.  Now, this is born again fiscal prudence on that side of the aisle. But what they are not telling people is not a penny of those cuts would go to pay for the Katrina disaster. No. In fact, they would, by implementing those cuts, still increase the deficit next year by a quarter of a billion dollars. Now, how can that be? I thought that money was going to pay for Katrina. No. They are going to borrow all the money to pay for Katrina. They are using those cuts to finance, guess what, more tax cuts for the richest among us. They want to make permanent the cuts in capital gains, dividends taxes, and a permanent exemption of all estates from all estate tax. That costs a lot of money.  Now, why should we do this? Well, because they believe in trickle-down economics. The way to stimulate our economy, the way to rebuild our economy is more trickle-down economics. They even, one conservative over there had the gall to say poor people do not put people to work. No, that is right. Poor people and working people do the work. But they are saying we need to shower more money on the richest among us.  During the last 2 years, 99 percent, this is from the Internal Revenue Service controlled by George Bush, their statistics, 99 percent of Americans saw real income reductions after inflation. One percent, those over $311,000, saw an increase; and one-tenth of 1 percent, those over $1.3 million, saw a huge increase in their income, mostly due to tax cuts paid for by working people and borrowing against our future. And now they have the gall to come to the floor of the House and say, if only the Republicans were in charge, this fiscal irresponsibility would stop. Excuse me. You control the White House, the House, the Senate, and the judiciary. You control everything. It is within your power. You want to pay for Katrina? Let us cut wasteful spending.                              {time}  1630  The President wants to borrow $1 trillion to go to Mars. They are already beginning to borrow $100 billion to go back to the Moon. Hey, JFK took us to the Moon for a fraction of the cost. Why do we need to borrow $100 billion to go back? That would pay for half of the Katrina disaster. Then we can talk about, guess what? Tax cuts for the wealthy.  If we just did not make those tax cuts permanent, we could pay for Katrina a number of times over. But oh, that would mean that rich people would pay income taxes at the same rate as working people, and that does not fit into their trickle-down theories.  There is a few other things that we could cut, agriculture subsidies. Let us say any farmer who earns over $100,000 a year will not get a taxpayer-financed subsidy where the money was borrowed, sometimes from Social Security, to subsidize that farm. That is pretty simple.  But no, they cannot go there. Or maybe we can get rid of the silly star wars fiasco. The general in charge of Star Wars has spent $100 billion on it so far, borrowed, taxpayer money, says it has a better than zero percent chance of working.  Now is that not heartening? Let us have real fiscal responsibility, not more phony bologna.                          ____________________
