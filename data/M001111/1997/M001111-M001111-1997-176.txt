 Pat taught me and everyone he touched a most important lesson--how to live life to the fullest with courage, and how to die with dignity.  Pat came to my office just a few years ago, but he was no stranger to Northwest politics. For 10 years he served on the staff of former Speaker Tom Foley. A schoolteacher, Pat started in Mr. Foley's office as a constituent caseworker and eventually moved to the Nation's Capital to become his adviser for agriculture issues.  His reputation was one of someone who was hardworking, down to earth, never caught in the insider beltway thinking. He was always remembering to do what was right for the people he knew so well--the people of Spokane and eastern Washington.  Two years ago, Pat wanted to return home to Washington State to raise his family. As it happened, we crossed paths at an opportune time: he was job-hunting just when I was looking for an eastern Washington director. Pat fit the bill perfectly, and I could not have asked for a better hire.  For the past 2 years, Pat ran my Spokane office. He worked diligently for the people: he was always there to take cases and advise my D.C. staff on issues like agriculture and business that so intimately affected the lives of the people around him. He was known across the countryside, and everyone to a person, loved him.  Pat was the guy we counted on. Quiet. Unassuming. But always honest, forthright, and clear. His advice on the farm bill, taxes, even welfare reform was always on target, because Pat always knew we worked for the people--and we were there to serve them first.  He was rare in political circles. He brought a certain generosity and good humor to the job that is not seen too often in politics any more. He loved it, he worked tirelessly, he loved being in the thick of things, but he never let it go to his head. And though he was a committed Democrat, he took pains to avoid bringing any partisan edge to his work. He never forgot who he was--a dad and husband first, a public servant, and a devoted community member.  Last spring Pat shared with us that he and his wife Janet were expecting a second child in November, as his first son, Miles, was just turning 3. A happier man, you could not find.  But July of this year brought tough news. Pat was diagnosed with liver cancer. The news of his illness was tough on all of us who knew him. There was universal disbelief. Everyone I talked to wanted to help, to change the course of his illness, to do something.  Inevitably, these conversations would bring out a funny story about Pat, about his tireless work on some project like housing, or commodity programs, or taking extra time to help a constituent who was upset and feeling frustrated with a bureaucracy. And the more I heard from people, the more clear it became just how special a person Pat was.  Despite chemotherapy and exhaustive treatment, Pat determinedly came to the office each day, after taking time to go to church and put his faith in God. He continued to be the one to encourage all of us, and to let us know he was going to be all right no matter what happened.  Recently it became clear his battle was coming to an end. Pat in his quiet way prepared all of us. He maintained what I can only call a relentless optimism. He reminded us of his deep faith, and said his greatest joy was seeing his new son, Paul, come into the world at the end of September. He even had the audacity to apologize when it became clear he could no longer work, but quickly added that he didn't mind because he never liked the commute. Somehow, amazingly, he always emphasized the positives.  He took care of his family and prepared for their future. Again, with great humor, he reminded us it was actually a blessing that he had time to do everything necessary to chart a path for them. He took the time to tell each of us who knew him that it was OK, not an end, just a new beginning for him.  A week and a half ago in Spokane, friends, family, and coworkers gathered together to honor Pat. Mayor Jack Geraghty declared it Pat Ormsby Appreciation Day in Spokane. We gathered with Pat to share feelings and stories about him and his endless contributions. Pat again thanked us all and said his goodbyes.  Last Thursday, we lost Pat. Our staff came together and shared a quiet moment. It was hard to believe he was gone, and it still is. He had become such an important part of our lives, as an example of a true public servant and family man--who always put others before himself and gave something of his life to so many.  It is not fair that children so young should be denied their father, or Janet her husband. But the steps he took to prepare near the end, and the way he lived his life, will be there to show how much he loved them. And because of the example he set, those children will carry something of their father with them always.  We are grateful we knew him, and we are especially grateful to his family for sharing him. We are comforted now only in knowing that a bit of Pat lives on in each of us who knew him: his courage, his common sense, and his pride in community, State, and country. Pat, in his short life, did what each of us should--gave much more than he received. We will miss him.                          ____________________
