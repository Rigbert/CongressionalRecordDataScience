 The gentleman mentioned extending the $1,000 child tax credit. Do you think this time we might include those families that are making less than $26,000 on this go-around? That has been pending for many, many months now, and, seeing as how you mentioned it, I thought I might inquire as to whether or not we might finally include the poorest working Americans in the benefit that has been extended to those that are doing a little better.  I yield to my friend.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. I cannot prejudge what the Committee on Ways and Means might decide to do on that particular bill, but I have a feeling that if this bill became law, the gentleman's concerns would all be taken care of.
