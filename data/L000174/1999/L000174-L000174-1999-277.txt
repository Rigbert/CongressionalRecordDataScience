This bill is designed, very substantive parts of it, for programs that we in the Senate debated and I think the American public are in support of and thought should be in place before our children go back to school this fall. This prompt action is what parents have talked to me about it, what school administrators have talked to me about it--that they need to have it in place before the schoolchildren go back this fall. They want to pass into law the things we learned from Columbine and other school tragedies.  That means we have a very short window, I think about 3 weeks, to finish this before the August recess. We have a very short window. If we don't finish this before the August recess and get it on the President's desk, I don't know how these programs will be in place.  Frankly, a lot has changed since my children were young enough to be in those classes. It may have been growing then, but the demand is paramount today. The Senator from Illinois is absolutely right. If we don't do it now, we are not going to get it done on time.
