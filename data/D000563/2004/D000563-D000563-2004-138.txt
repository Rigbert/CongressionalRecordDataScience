LEAHY. Mr. President, I would note that we have approved, first, 100 in the 17 months that we, the Democrats, were in charge of the Senate.  In the next 21, 22, 23 months, however long it was that the Republicans were in charge, another 98 were confirmed.  I don't think a single one was defeated on the Senate floor. A small number had been held back--I think about one-tenth of what the Republican majority held back during the Clinton Presidency.  Actually, I might say to my friend from Illinois, we have confirmed more than we did during President Reagan's first term when, of course, you had a Republican Senate throughout his term. For that matter, we confirmedmore than President George H.W. Bush.
