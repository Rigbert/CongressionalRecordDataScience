Speaker, reserving the right to object--I understand there is a problem--and I intend to object.  We have told all our people to go home. It is not just a question of being in their offices, with all due respect. They are on their way to their planes. It is far after the time when we usually leave on a go-away day.  And I feel badly. I am going to look at the TV. I don't, frankly, think--I was sitting right here. I didn't hear or see anybody asking for a recorded vote. And, very frankly, you don't usually have to ask for a recorded vote because, when you were in the majority, it was always us that had to record the vote because we were losing. Frankly, I think that is what happened, I will be very honest with you.  But again, I would like to be able to correct this situation. But I cannot do that in good conscience because people have told me they had 1:30 planes, and they are gone. And I feel very badly about that, but that is the fact.  I don't think any games were played. I am going to look at the tape--it is on television--and see. I understand the problem that most of you were not for the resolution that passed. We didn't stop anybody from asking for a vote, nor could we have stopped anybody from asking for a vote. I was surprised that it went without a vote.  The Speaker and the Parliamentarian indicate that the proper procedure was followed, but the vote was not asked for. Therefore, I feel badly about it, because I understand the problem you are in. But I have Members who have left for the airports and they are not going to be here.  The vote, if it was reconsidered, is equally important on our side as it is on your side. I cannot expose my Members to missing that vote, nor will I. And I apologize for that. But I hope you understand that, given the situation, I cannot let my Members be subjected to missing that vote, which is a very important vote for them. And, therefore, I will have to object.
