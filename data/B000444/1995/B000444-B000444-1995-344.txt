 President, I thank my friend from Utah. As usual, he is always reasonable.  The effect of what the Senator has just done is to modify the underlying bill that he introduced, the Hatch amendment, the Hatch bill, the Hatch-Dole bill.  It maintains in capital cases the requirement that counsel be appointed at trial and in a habeas proceeding, and it makes discretionary the appointment of counsel at those stages in noncapital cases.  That leaves one part of my original amendment that still needs to be resolved. We can speak to it in a very short order.  There was a third section of the existing bill that was attempted to be amended by my amendment.  I send that modification of my amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.
