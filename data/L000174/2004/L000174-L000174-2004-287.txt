President, if I might, obviously the statutes on the books have not stopped them from overcharging, have not stopped them from the kinds of things we have seen.  Nobody wants to use the word ``Halliburton'' around here, but we constantly pick up the paper and read about a number of these companies. They are obviously overcharging, and nothing is happening to them. I am just one frustrated American who wants them to stop.
