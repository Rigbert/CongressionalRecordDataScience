Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise to congratulate the University of Maryland on its double victory last month in the NCAA Division I lacrosse national championships. Both the women's Terrapin and men's Terrapin teams brought the highest prize home to College Park in Maryland's Fifth District, representing the first time that both Maryland lacrosse teams won championships in the same year.  Lacrosse has deep roots in Maryland, an older version having been played across eastern and central North America for centuries by Native American nations. That game inspired European settlers and their descendants in the United States and Canada to implement the modem game of lacrosse, which has become one of our country's most popular sports. Played in youth leagues, high schools, and colleges across America, lacrosse teaches teamwork, sportsmanship, athleticism, strategy, and leadership.  The University of Maryland's lacrosse program has been competitive nationally even long before the NCAA's national championships first began for men in 1971 and for women in 1982. Since the 1930's, the Terrapin men's team won the Wingate Memorial Trophy several times as the victors of the U.S. Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association national championship. For the modem tournament, the Terrapin men won championships in 1973 and 1975 before beginning a forty-two year drought that ended last month with their 9-6 victory over Ohio State in the 2017 championship game, led by Head Coach John Tillman. Coach Tillman took over the Maryland lacrosse program seven years ago and has brought the team to six NCAA Final Four tournaments and five national championships. This year's men's roster included eight All-Americans, who helped make 2017 a year to remember.  For the Terrapin women, winning championships became a tradition, with thirteen national titles since 1982, including a streak of seven consecutive victories from 1995 to 2001. This year, they beat Boston College 16-13 in a closely contested game held in Massachusetts to secure their fourteenth national championship. Head Coach Cathy Reese, herself an alumna of the University of Maryland, has been leading the Terrapin women since 2007. As a former Terrapin lacrosse star, Coach Reese was a two-time All-American and was named the NCAA tournament's `Most Valuable Player' in 1998. This year, her Terrapins finished the season with an undefeated, 23-0 record, capped by this latest national title. This is their third championship victory in the last four years. Five of the team's athletes were named All-Americans for 2017.  Both teams were led by standout stars, and for the first time in NCAA lacrosse history both recipients of the prestigious Tewaaraton Award, which honors the top men's and women's players each year, were won by Maryland athletes. For the women's team, midfielder and captain Zoe Stukenberg brought home the award, while for the men attackman Matt Rambo received the honor. Both of them have also been nominated for Espy awards, with the winners to be announced on July 12.  I'm proud that the University of Maryland is a national powerhouse for both athletics and academics, leading the country both on the playing field and in classrooms and laboratories. I join in congratulating our victorious Terrapins and wishing them much success as they prepare for next season and to defend their historic double-victory.                          ____________________
