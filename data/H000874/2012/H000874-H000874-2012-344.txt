Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Chopticon High School Marching Band on earning the title of United States Scholastic Band Association Group IIIA Maryland State Champions. ``The Showband of Southern Maryland'' from Morganza, Maryland, has earned this title for the past three consecutive years.  This momentous victory was made all the more significant given the caliber of their competition. After competing previously at three regional competitions, the band took first place at the State Championship, hosted by Towson University on October 15, 2011 with their performance titled ``The Heart of Madness.'' Theband went on to compete and place fourth at the National Championship in Allentown, Pennsylvania.  This victory demonstrates that with hard work, determination, and discipline, we can reach our goals. The band also received awards for best music, effect, visual, performance, and guard. Fifty-three musicians qualified for the performance, and they remained focused and determined to achieve their dream of victory at the statewide competition.  I want to applaud the band's staff--Todd Burroughs, Christina Burroughs, Bobby Jones, Mark Lortz, Megan Howell, Briscoe Thompson, and Kevin Burroughs for their dedication and commitment to training these superb musicians. I also send my hardiest congratulations to the members of the marching band on their victory--Carrie Barrett, Alexis Badovski, Samantha Lockard, Breanna Thorne, Brendan Utt, Bailie Anthony, Elizabeth Barnes, William Husk, Kacey Roberts, Jennifer Russnogle, Paula Wills, Robert Konen, Chris Mitchell, Marlena Krauth, Jennifer Thalman, Sam Prettyman, Dakota Sparks, Josh Wetherald, Geoffrey Westbrook, Joey Coleman, Kelsie Gill, Philip Hayden, Garret Ordille, Matt Ordille, Megan Mosier, Nick Nelson, Ryan Nelson, Kelly Purdy, Jacob Thorne, Kayla Bean, Kolleen Dare, Jake Flowers, Jennafer Harris, Rachel Kaper, Kayla Morris, Taylor McQueeney, Nicole Sadecki, Hunter Sparks, Madison Bateman, Rachel Escolopio, Amber Griffith, Sabrina Hill, Danielle Hilton, Carly Keating, Hannah Kozlowski, Emily McKoy, Rachel Nussberger, Darby Powell, Layne Thompson, Melanie Thompson, Kristen Wetzel, Mackenize Wood, Meredith Wood, and Gina Zanelotti.  I'm very proud of these young men and women, and I congratulate all those involved in bringing home the championship title. I ask that my colleagues join me in applauding this significant accomplishment.                          ____________________
