 President, I am introducing for myself, Senator Hatch, and Senator Heflin, a bill entitled ``The Federal Courts Improvements Act of 1996.'' A first version of the bill, S. 1101, was introduced in August 1995, at the request of the Judicial Conference. In October of last year, we held a comprehensive hearing on that bill in the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, which I chair, at which both judges and lawyers testified at length on the substance of many of S. 1101's provisions. The present bill was crafted after many months of detailed discussions and intense collaboration between myself, Senators Hatch and Heflin, and the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. More importantly, we have worked closely with the other members of the subcommittee to address their concerns and include their suggestions, making this truly a bipartisan bill.  At the onset, I would like to elaborate on the spirit in which this bill was crafted. I am sure my colleagues are well aware, many of my efforts have focused on saving the Federal Government's sparse resources and making the most of taxpayer dollars. As chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee with jurisdiction over the courts, I am also concerned that the Federal judicial system be administered in themost efficient and cost-effective manner possible, while maintaining a high level of quality in the administration of justice. In fact, I sent out a judicial questionnaire earlier this year requesting assistance from individual judges on their ideas and views of the needs of the Federal judiciary. I hope some of you have had the opportunity to review my subcommittee's report on the courts of appeal, which I released recently. The report on the District courts will be completed shortly. I found it enlightening to communicate with the individual judges, and hope that these lines of candid and constructive communication with the individual judges and the Administrative Office remain open and continue to produce beneficial results in terms of efficiency, cost savings, and other improvements within the Federal judiciary.  In drafting the Federal Courts Improvement bill, we worked closely with the Administrative Office to assess and address the needs of the Federal judiciary. As a result, the bill contains both technical and substantive changes in the law, many of which were carried over from previous Congresses and-or originally proposed in S. 1101. During our working sessions on the bill, some of the provisions in S. 1101, such as the sections dealing with Federal Defender Services matters, were determined to warrant further inquiry or additional hearings. On the whole, the bill is broad-reaching, and contains provisions concerning judicial process improvements; judiciary personnel administration, benefits and protections; judicial financial administration; Federal Courts Study Committee recommendations; and other miscellaneous issues. Almost all of the provisions have been formally endorsed by the Judicial Conference, the governing body of the Federal courts. I would now like to mention some of the more salient provisions of the bill.  Many provisions contained in this bill streamline the operation of the Federal court system. A good example of our attempt to render the judiciary more efficient is section 605, which abolishes a special tribunal with narrow jurisdiction, the Special Court, the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, established in the early 1970's to oversee the reorganization of insolvent railroads. The work of this court is basically concluded, with the court's docket containing 10 largely inactive cases. This section transfers the Special Court's jurisdiction over those cases and any future rail reorganization proceedings to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, where the court's records and a majority of its judges are currently located, and makes other technical and conforming changes incidental to the court's abolition. The elimination of this court will produce budgetary and administrative economies and, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, result in an annual cost savings of approximately $175,000.  Section 209 simplifies the appeal route in civil cases decided by magistrate judges with consent by confining appeals of judgments in such cases to the court of appeals and eliminating an alternative route of appeal to the district judge. A single forum of appeal in civil consent cases simplifies court procedures and recognizes the existing practice in most districts. The Judicial Conference recommended such action in the long range plan for the Federal courts. Also, this section would not alter the role of magistrate judges as adjuncts to article III courts since district judges would still control the referral of consent cases to magistrate judges.  Section 304 changes the reappointment procedure for incumbent bankruptcy judges. Rather than requiring the judicial council for a circuit or a merit selection panel to undergo a lengthy and time-consuming screening process, this section streamlines the reappointment process for judges whose performance has previously been reviewed. In this manner, the section eliminates unnecessary expenditures of time and money.  Another example is section 202, which authorizes magistrate judges to try all petty offense cases. Traditionally, safeguards applicable to criminal defendants charged with more serious crimes have not been applicable to petty offense cases because the burdens were deemed undesirable and impractical in dealing with such minor misconduct. Section 202 also authorizes magistrate judges to try misdemeanor cases upon either written consent or oral consent of the defendant on the record. This amendment enhances the efficiency of the courts, since most defendants routinely consent to proceeding before the Federal magistrate judge system. Presently, consent to trial of misdemeanor cases by magistrate judges is required to be in writing, although there is no legal significance between written consent and consent made orally on the record, provided that the defendant's consent is made with full knowledge of the consequences of such consent, is intelligently given, and is voluntary. Elimination of the written-consent requirement saves time and eases burdensome paperwork for court personnel, while preserving knowing and voluntary consent in such cases.  Additional sections that facilitate judicial operations are sections 201 and 205. Section 201 authorizes magistrate judges temporarily assigned to another judicial district because of an emergency to dispose of civil cases with the consent of the parties. Section 205 clarifies that deputy clerks may act whenever the clerk is unable to perform official duties for any reason, and permits the court to designate an acting clerk of the court, when it is expected that the clerk will be unavailable or the office of clerk will be vacant for a prolonged period.  Provisions in this bill also clarify existing law to better fulfill Congress' original intent. For example, section 208 enables the United States to obtain a Federal forum in which to defend suits against Federal officers and agencies when those suits involve Federal defenses. This section would legislatively reverse the Supreme Court's decision in International Primate Protection League, et al. v. Administrators of Tulane Educational Fund, et al., 111 S.Ct. 1700 (1991), which held that only Federal officers, and not Federal agencies, may remove State court actions to Federal court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1442(a)(1). The section would also reverse at least three other Federal district court decisions which held that Federal officers sued exclusively in their official capacities cannot remove State court actions to Federal court. The result of these decisions has been that Federal agencies have had to defend themselves in State court, despite important and complex Federal issues such as preemption and sovereign immunity. Section 208 fulfills Congress' intent that questions concerning the exercise of Federal authority, as well as the scope of Federal immunity and Federal-State conflicts, be adjudicated in Federal court. It also clarifies that suits against Federal agencies, as well as those against Federal officers sued in either an individual or official capacity, may be removed to Federal district court. More importantly, this section does not alter the requirement that a Federal law defense be alleged for a suit to be removable pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1442(a)(1).  Another example is section 503, which repeals a provision in a 1981 continuing appropriation resolution barring annual cost-of-living adjustments in pay for Federal judges except as specifically authorized by Congress. Repeal of section 140 restores the operation of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 461 as to article III judges and parity with the other two branches of Government, as enacted by the Federal Salary Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 1975 and amended by the Ethics Reform Act of 1989.  Several sections improve the judicial court system in other ways. Section 206 amends section 1332 of title 28 relating to diversity jurisdiction to raise the jurisdictional amount in diversity cases from $50,000 to $75,000. The purpose of this amendment is to supplement the increase of the jurisdictional amount from $10,000 to $50,000 in the 100th Congress by a modest upward adjustment to $75,000. Section 210 requires each Judicial Council to submit an annual report to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts on the number and nature of orders relating to judicial misconduct or disability under section 332 of title 28 of the United States Code. This reporting requirement was recommended by the Report of the National Commission on Judicial Discipline and Removal of August 1993, which found that reliable information concerning council orders was difficult to obtain.  In addition, section 608 extends by 6 months the due date of the Civil Justice Reform Act reports on the demonstration and pilot programs. The bill at section 609 also extends the authorization of appropriations by 1 year of the use of arbitration by district courts under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 651. This will give us more time, if needed, to consider how we will implement permanently alternative dispute resolution in the courts.  In conclusion, this bill is the result of careful consideration by members of the subcommittee and their staff, in close collaboration with the Administrative Office, who have all worked long and hard in attempting to produce a strong, bipartisan piece of legislation. I am pleased to say that the legislation we are introducing today not only enhances and improves the operation of the Federal judiciary, but also takes into consideration any potential increase in costs to the Federal budget.                                 ______      By
