 The gentleman ends with the observation that you expect action to avoid default as soon as possible. As you know, Mr. Leader, very well--as we all know--beginning tomorrow, the Treasury Department will have to start using extraordinary measures becausethe authorization for the debt limit to be extended will end on the 7th. Secretary Lew has written to all of us and warned us that, on Monday, stating that:       Time is short. Inaction could cause harm to our economy,      rattle financial markets, and hurt taxpayers.  I know that my friend has made similar comments, as I have made similar comments. We agree on this proposition. But I am concerned that we only have 7 legislative days scheduled for the rest of the month.  Does the gentleman expect that we will take an up-or-down vote on a clean debt limit extension next week or before the end of this month?  I yield to my friend.
