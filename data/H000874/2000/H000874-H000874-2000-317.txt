Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I am once again pleased to cosponsor this resolution with the gentleman from California (Mr. Thomas), the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Boehner), and others.  This resolution, as the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Boehner) has pointed out, provides for the annual commemoration of the Holocaust on May 4 of this year.  Mr. Speaker, there is no occasion more important for the international community and for humanity than to remember the tragedy that occurred in the 1930s and 1940s, the massive loss of life and the reality of man's inhumanity to man. It is appropriate, I believe, that we use the Rotunda, the location of so many historic events, again to draw attention and focus on one of the greatest tragedies in human history.  It reminds us, Mr. Speaker, that such events must never again be permitted to occur and that only through our vigilance will that be ensured.  The ceremony will be a part of the annual Days of Remembrance sponsored by the United States Holocaust Memorial Council. It is intended to encourage citizens to reflect on the Holocaust, to remember its victims and to strengthen our sense of democracy and human rights.  Mr. Speaker, I would observe that it is particularly important that succeeding generations who have largely grown up in a relatively peaceful world be called upon to remember this event. We have seen all too recently events similar in character, if not in scope, as we saw in Kosovo and in Bosnia. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf) just mentioned Africa. The Holocaust is an event, a time in history, that we ought to remember so that successor generations never repeat it.  The theme of this year's Days of Remembrance is ``The Holocaust and the New Century: The Imperative to Remember.''  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and urge its adoption.
