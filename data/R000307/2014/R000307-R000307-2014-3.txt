President, agriculture is one of the leading economic and cultural drivers in Kansas. Across our State, farmers and ranchers work hard every day to feed a growing world, often without the appreciation or recognition they deserve.  I rise today to offer my sincere congratulations and thanks to a special Kansas farmer and friend. Steve Baccus is a native Kansan, a veteran, a husband, a father of five, and a grandfather whose fourth-generation family farm in Ottawa County continues to produce wheat, corn, soybeans, and occasionally sunflowers and sorghum.  For the past 17 years, Steve has served on the board of directors for Kansas Farm Bureau, including the last 12 as its president. Kansas Farm Bureau is our State's largest general farm organization, with nearly 105,000 members. Under his leadership the organization has successfully influenced State and national agriculture policy, promoted rural values, and worked to show an increasingly urban populace how food is truly produced.  In addition to his service as president of the Kansas Farm Bureau, Steve Baccus has been a true partner in government. He has led trade missions, presented testimony before Congress and State legislative committees, and told the complex story of agriculture for much of his adult life.  Steve Baccus embodies many traits we can all admire: a deep love for the great State of Kansas, gratitude for the many hard-working families who provide the food, fuel, and fiber Americans rely on, and the respect of his peers across the Nation.  I personally am grateful for Steve's many years of wise counsel to me and for his service to Kansas and agriculture. I wish him and his wife Patricia all the best in their next chapter.                          ____________________
