 President, if there is no further business to come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in adjournment under the previous order as a mark of further respect to the memory of former Senator Gaylord Nelson.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:11 p.m., adjourned until Tuesday, July 12, 2005, at 9:45 a.m.
