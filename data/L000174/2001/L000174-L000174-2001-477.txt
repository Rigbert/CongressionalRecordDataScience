President, I am pleased to join Senators Thompson and Lieberman in cosponsoring this legislation to improve the Federal Election Campaign Act, known as FECA. This legislation would increase criminal penalties for knowing and willful campaign finance violations, direct the Sentencing Commission to promulgate guidelines for violations, and clarify parts of FECA. This legislation is important to ensure that we have an enforcement structure that would deter knowing violations of the laws now on the books.  Questions about the financing of the 1996 Federal elections have been the subject of multiple, expensive, overlapping, and repeated congressional hearings. In 1997, the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs held 32 days of hearings, calling 70 witnesses, at a cost of $3.5 million to investigate campaign finance violations relating to the 1996 Federal elections. The House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight has been investigating campaign finance violations since June 1997, including over 45 days of hearings. The Senate Judiciary Committee held its own series of hearings in the 106th Congress on the 1996 campaign finance investigations. Needless to say, all of these committees have spent countless hours investigating, collecting and reviewing documents, and holding hearings on alleged campaign finance abuses in the 1996 campaign. This legislation is one of the most constructive products to come out of those investigations.  Indeed, in a report to then-Attorney General Reno, the former Chief of the Campaign Finance Task Force at the Department of Justice, Charles LaBella, recommended reforms in the campaign finance laws, including the increased penalties and clarificationsto certain parts of the FECA embodied in this legislation.  This bill would authorize felony prosecutions of knowing and willful FECA violations involving improper contributions aggregating $25,000 or more during a calendar year. It would also increase the statute of limitations to 5 years, which is the standard statute of limitation for Federal offenses. In addition, the bill would direct the Sentencing Commission to promulgate guidelines. Finally, the bill would clarify that foreign nationals who are not permanent residents may not donate to a candidate or political party as well as make clear that the FECA's prohibition on conduit contributions applies to any type of donation.  I am glad to join in cosponsoring this legislation again, as I did in the last Congress, and urge its prompt passage.  To the extent that we are frustrated by campaign finance abuses, I believe passage of this legislation is a better use of this body's time than the open-ended fishing expedition into open and closed cases.                                 ______                                       By
