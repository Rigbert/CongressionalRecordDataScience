President, I do not yet know the answer to the question raised by the Senator from Illinois. It is very thoughtful of him. I offer to withhold. I was going to debate a little bit further with Senator Warner, but perhaps we have covered that to death and should wait until tomorrow to conclude our comments.  I ask through the Chair, could the Senator tell me how long he wishes to speak?
