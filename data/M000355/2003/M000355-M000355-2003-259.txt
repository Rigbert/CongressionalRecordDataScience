 President, if I may state briefly on the issue of funding of global AIDS, I think it is important to remind our colleagues it was the President who recommended $15 billion over 5 years to attack this global public health crisis. Even without enacting amendments that go above the budget, the $2 billion that is in this appropriations bill and another appropriations bill that has already cleared the Senate--between the two bills, $2 billion--provides for the administration, even if we are unable through this process at some point this year to provide additional appropriations, to spend all the money that the administration feels it can usefully spend in the first year of the 5-year commitment. This Senator has no doubt that the full $15 billion over 5 years will be appropriated to address this huge public health crisis.                          ____________________
