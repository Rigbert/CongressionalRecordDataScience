Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  In closing this debate, let me just say that the whole debate should be aboutrestoring the public's faith in our government and their trust. Allowing elections to be bought by the highest bidder will not restore that trust, and certainly raising campaign contribution limits will not restore that trust.  To those who claim that campaigns in this decade cannot be won on just $100, look per contributor, look at what Lawton Chiles did in Florida. He was able to win in keeping within campaign finance spending limits. The law was reformed there, and he won.  Let us bring back the people's trust in our Government. Vote against this amendment. We need limits, not increases in contribution levels.
