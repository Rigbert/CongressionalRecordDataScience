 Prsident, this week the Committee on Foreign Relations began a comprehensive series of six hearings on NATO enlargement. I commend Chairman Helms for holding these hearings at this busy time. He and I have met at great length to construct the agenda as preparation for the committee's acting expeditiously next year to consider the enlargement amendment to the Washington Treaty.  At the committee's first hearing on October 7, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright outlined the adminsitration's strategic rationale for enlargement. Mr. President, I ask permission for the text of Secretary Albright's statement be printed in the Record. Following my remarks.
