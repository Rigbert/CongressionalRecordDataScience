President, I am pleased to support the nomination of Eduardo Aguirre to serve as Director of the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services (BCIS), in the newly-created Department of Homeland Security. I was very impressed with him at his nomination hearing, and I look forward to working with him in his new position.  I am pleased that this nomination was referred to the Judiciary Committee, which continues to have jurisdiction over immigration legislation and oversight. Similarly, I am pleased that we were able to obtain unanimous consent last week for the Judiciary Committee to receive a subsequent referral on the nomination of Michael Garcia to head the Bureau of Customs and Immigration Enforcement--BICE.  The recent Inspector General report on the treatment of ``9/11 detainees''shows the severe consequences that can be faced by those immigrants who fail to mention their unlawful status. Of course, the responsibility to remain here legally falls upon immigrants, but there are occasions when immigrants live up to that responsibility and are nonetheless failed by errors and backlogs on the Government's part. I hope and trust that preventing such errors will be a major priority for Mr. Aguirre. I also hope that he will use his position to battle the perception in many immigrant communities that the war on terrorism has become a war on immigrants.  At his confirmation hearing, I talked to Mr. Aguirre about the former INS employees in Vermont who will be under his jurisdiction, including those at the Vermont Service Center in St. Albans. I recommended to him that he build on the established INS workforce throughout the State by making Vermont a regional center for his agency, and I was pleased that he seemed to take that advice seriously. I am eager to work with him to see that idea become a reality.  On the national level, it was a priority for many of us in Congress that immigration services not be overlooked at the Department of Homeland Security. Although our security is paramount, the new Department must remember that our Nation's founding principals and economic health demand that immigration be handled in a fair and orderly way. After his confirmation hearing, I believe that Mr. Aguirre--himself a refugee--understands this at a fundamental level.  He faces a challenging job. I have already written him about the backlogs that plague our immigration system, and I hope that he is able to make meaningful change in that area. The President has pledged to reduce the average backlog for immigration petitions to 6 months by 2006--to do so is going to take serious investment, and I hope Mr. Aguirre will be a voice inside the administration to make that investment.                          ____________________
