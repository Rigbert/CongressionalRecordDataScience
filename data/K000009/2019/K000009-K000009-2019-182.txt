 Mayor Adamowicz was a powerful voice for liberty in Poland, and always acted with the best interests of his people at heart.  A resurgent Russia seeks to undermine transatlantic solidarity and Western resolve. In the face of transatlantic challenges, we must strengthen U.S.-Polish relations.  That is why we must extend a hand of friendship to the next generation of democratic, transatlantic leaders. These shared democratic values go back to our nations' founding, and are critical to liberty in Europe today.  I am honored to introduce legislation to establish the ``Pawel Adamowicz Democratic Leadership Exchange Act.'' This program would equip the next generation of leaders with the skills and networks needed to strengthen transatlantic relationships.  In honor of Mayor Adamowicz's legacy, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. I ask that it be brought to the floor for a vote without delay.                          ____________________
