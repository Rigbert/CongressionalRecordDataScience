Mr. Speaker, today I am reintroducing legislation to wage a comprehensive fight against Lyme disease.  This proposal represents the next stage of our campaign to reduce and then eradicate Lyme disease. it is a five year, $125 million blueprint for attacking the disease on every front. In addition to authorizing the necessary resources to wage this war, the bill: (1) makes the development of better detection tests for Lyme the highest priority of Lyme disease research; (2) lays out a lost of vital public health goals for agencies to accomplish, including a 33 percent reduction in Lyme disease within five years of enactment in the 10 highest and most endemic states; (3) fosters better coordination between the scattered Lyme disease programs within the Federal Government through a five-year joint-agency plan so that the left hand knows what the right hand is doing; (4) helps protect federal workers and visitors at federally owned lands in endemic areas through a system of periodic, standardized, and publically accessible Lyme disease risk assessments; (5) requires a review of our system of Lyme disease prevention and surveillance of search for areas of improvement; (6) fosters additional research into other related tick-borne illnesses so that the problem of co-infection can be addressed; (7) initiates a plan to boost public and physician understanding about Lyme disease; and (8) creates a Lyme Disease Task Force to provide the public with the opportunity to hold our public health officials accountable as they accomplish these tasks.  Mr. Speaker, Lyme disease is one of our nation's fastest growing infectious diseases, and the most common tick-borne disease in America. According to some estimates, Lyme disease costs our nation $1 billion to $2 billion in medical costs annually. The number of confirmed cases of Lyme disease was nearly 16,000 last year, an increase of 24.5 percent from the previous year, and that is only the tip of the iceberg. Many experts believe the official statistics understate the true numbers of Lyme disease cases by as much as ten or twelve-fold. Lyme disease is sometimes called the `Great Pretender' disease because its symptoms so closely mimic other conditions. Thus, it can be easily misdiagnosed. Worse still, our current detection tests are not always reliable and accurate enough to defect the disease in patients.  The Lyme Disease Initiative of 1999 builds on the accomplishments of the legislation introduced in the previous Congress, H.R. 379. As Members may recall, we were successful in getting a portion of that bill enacted as part of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999, as well as part of the Fiscal Year 1999 Defense Appropriations bill. The provisions from last year up dedicated up to $3 million in Department of Defense funding dedicated for Lyme and tick-borne disease research, so that our soldiers and their families can be protected when they work and live in areas endemic for Lyme disease. This $3 million in funding was a good start, but there is still so much that remains unknown about Lyme disease.  That is where the new proposal comes in. It is the product of countless meetings with patients and families struggling to cope with this terribly debilitating disease. I cannot tell my colleagues how many times I have met with families who have told me heart breaking stories about how they went from doctor to doctor without getting an accurate diagnosis, getting progressively weaker and sicker, while racking up massive medical bills. Sadly, the lack of physician knowledge about Lyme disease, and the inadequacies of existing laboratory detection tests, compound the misery. Consequently, we have consulted extensively with the organizations representing these patients, as well as with the agencies charged with implementing the new program, to ensure that the bill addresses these very real concerns.  In short, I believe this is a good plan that affirmatively meets the needs of patients, and one that is worthy of my colleagues' support.                   The Lyme Disease Initiative of 1999        Section 1. Short Title--Lyme Disease Initiative of 1999                          Section 2. Findings        Section 3. Five Year Plan of Action, Public Health Goals       Establishes a Five-Year plan (authorizing $125 million over      five years) to reduce the incidence and prevalence of Lyme      disease, and requires Secretaries of Health and Human      Services, Defense, Agriculture, and Interior to collaborate      in creating this five year plan.       Goal No. 1: Direct Direction Tests. The legislation directs      federal researchers to make the development of a reliable,      reproducible direct detection test for Lyme disease a      priority. Without a good detection test, individuals will      continue to get misdiagnosed, insurance companies will      continue to dispute and deny needed treatments, and patients      will not know if they are truly cured of Lyme.       Goal No. 2: Improved Surveillance and Reporting System.      Requires a review of the existing reporting system for Lyme,      including     the surveillance criteria used to determine whether or not a      case of Lyme is counted in the state statistics reported to      CDC. Requires this review to be inclusive, and obtain the      input of health providers, Lyme disease patient advocacy      groups, and state and local governments. It also considers      the use of a `dual reporting' system so that valuable data      collected on persons who do not meet the surveillance      criteria definition of Lyme--but are still being treated for      Lyme by their doctor.       Goal No. 3: Lyme Disease Prevention. Requires CDC to      establish a baseline rate of Lyme disease in the 10 highest      endemic states, and aims for a reduction in this rate of 33      percent within 5 years. Means used to accomplish this goal      may include natural and non-pesticidal means to control tick      populations, as well as better public education and      systematic risk assessments on the risks of Lyme disease on      federally owned lands in endemic areas.       Goal No. 4: Prevention of Other Tick-Borne Diseases.      Authorizes programs to prevent, and expand research on, other      tick-borne infectious diseases. Although Lyme disease cases      are the overwhelming majority of all tick-borne infections in      the U.S., many Lyme patients are co-infected with other tick-     borne diseases.       Goal No. 5: Improved Public and Physician Education.      Establishes a multi-departmental program to improve public      and health provider awareness of how to prevent Lyme disease,      how to diagnose it, and how to treat it.                   Section 4. Lyme Disease Task Force       Establishes a joint government/public Lyme Disease Task      Force to provide advice to the Secretaries of Agriculture,      Health and Human Services, Defense and Interior on achieving      the five public health goals.       Public members on the task force will include: (1) Lyme      disease research scientists, (2) Lyme disease patient      advocacy organizations, (3) clinicians with extensive      experience in treating Lyme disease, (4) Lyme disease      patients, and/or the parents or family members of those who      have had Lyme disease.                       Section 5. Annual Reports       Mandates annual progress reports to Congress so the      taxpayers will be able to hold agencies accountable for      following through on the five year plan.                         Section 6. Definitions               Section 7. Authorization of Appropriations       Provides $125 million over five years in new authorization      to fund this coordinated, multi-agency war on Lyme disease.       $40 million in additional authorization over five years ($8      million/year) for the National Institutes of Health (NIH),      most of which will be used to develop and improve direct      detection tests for Lyme. This new money, if appropriated,      will increase existing NIH Lyme research by approximately 41      percent.       $40 million in additional authorization over five years ($8      million/year) for the Centers for Disease Control and      Prevention (CDC). This money will be used to review the      surveillance criteria, fund tick control and public education      initiatives, as well as prevention programs. If enacted and      appropriated, CDC resources devoted to Lyme would be doubled      under the proposed bill.       $30 million in additional authorization over five years ($6      million/year) for the Department of Defense (DoD). This      amount was identified by DoD in its Fiscal Year 1999 report      to Congress on Lyme disease as the amount necessary to fund      current and future research requirements.       $7.5 million in additional authorization over five years      ($1.5 million/year) for the Department of Agriculture to      enhance USDA's research capabilities on Lyme. USDA currently      is exploring innovative techniques to remove/manage tick      populations with minimal pesticide exposure to humans.       $7.5 million in additional authorization over five years      ($1.5 million/year) for the Department of Interior. This will      be used to improve public awareness and understanding of the      risks of Lyme disease at federally owned lands, as well as      needed tick control efforts.------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                   Total                                                number Lyme     Annual                                                   cases      incidence                     State                      reported to  per 100,000                                                 CDC 1989-     persons                                                    1998------------------------------------------------------------------------New York......................................       39,370         21.6Connecticut...................................       17,728         54.2Pennsylvania..................................       14,870         12.3New Jersey....................................       13,428         16.9Wisconsin.....................................        4,760          9.3Rhode Island..................................        3,717         37.5Maryland......................................        3,410          6.8Massachusetts.................................        2,712          4.5Minnesota.....................................        1,745          3.8Delaware......................................        1,003         14.0------------------------------------------------------------------------
