President, I am here to work on what should be an area of widespread, bipartisan agreement with the introduction of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2006. Many, many people in both parties profess the need to reduce our Government's spending. When I hear individuals waxing poetic about the need for fiscal discipline, I usually offer a simple, one-sentence amendment to restore some discretionary spending discipline, but you should see my friends on the other side of the aisle run for the hills when someone proposes we actually do something about it. When the moment comes to move from mere words to real action on fiscal discipline, over and over I have confronted nearly united opposition to it on the other side of the aisle.  Last year we did make some progress on our shared goal. We actually held last year's non-security discretionary spending down below the rate of inflation. Let me repeat that: We actually held last year's non-security spending, over which we had discretion, down below the rate of inflation.  Again, we are faced with the same task.  The President agrees that we must hold down spending and has proposed to hold down discretionary spending. The Budget Committee agrees we must hold down spending and has proposed to hold down discretionary spending. The American people agree we must hold down spending. Senator Dorgan has said that we need to provide spending cuts in a significant manner. Senator Feingold has said, ``We also need to continue to cut spending in Federal programs. . . .'' Senator Levin stated how we need to cut spending when he advocated that ``Discretionary spending . . . [be] frozen for 5 years.'' It seems that both parties agree that we must hold down discretionary spending.  Well, let's hold down discretionary spending.  I will read the one sentence that is really the entirety of this bill. I'm sure everyone in this body is familiar with it now--nearly all of my friends on the other side of the aisle have voted against it twice in the last twelve months, usually at a time when they are promoting fiscal discipline. It says: ``Beginning with fiscal year 2008 and thereafter, all non-defense, non-trost-fund, discretionary spending shall not exceed the previous fiscal year's levels without a two-thirds vote.'' This is simply a cap on discretionary spending.  It is very simple, cut and dry, something that can pass. I hope those individuals who have a more complicated approach to this will recognize this is something that is doable.  I want to focus briefly on one point in the President's most recent budget proposal. President Bush wisely sent us a budget that encourages long-term fiscal constraint by including several budget process and program oversight reforms, including setting enforceable limits on total spending to stabilize budget growth in the long-term. Simply put, the President proposes that we put in place a process by which we can control discretionary spending.  I have been working on a solution to the massive problem of government spending with this simple language for quite some time. I have actually wanted to offer it previously on appropriations bills, but held off. I offered it as an amendment last November and again this year in March. It has been defeated every time I offer it--every single time. It's usually defeated by nearly unanimous opposition on the other side of the aisle. And what's more, they usually vote against it in a debate during which they cry foul of deficits and declare the need for fiscal restraint. It's astounding how much rhetoric we hear about the need to hold down spending and the need for fiscalrestraint. I guess for some, it truly is much easier said than done.  So, I am offering it again.  I will restate the crux of this bill, the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2006, one more time before I close: ``Beginning with fiscal year 2008 and thereafter, all non-defense, non-trust-fund, discretionary spending shall not exceed the previous fiscal year's levels without a two-thirds vote.'' Folks, it's that easy. I ask that you join me in holding down spending.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 4062       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Fiscal Responsibility Act of      2006''.     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL ENFORCEMENT.

(b) Effective Date.--This section shall apply beginning      with fiscal year 2008.                                 ______                                       By
