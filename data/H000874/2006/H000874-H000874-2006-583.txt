Speaker, America lost one of its finest scientists this week. And I lost both a constituent and a dear friend.  Kenneth Tenore, a coastal ecologist from Hollywood, Maryland, died of acute pancreatitis Sunday at University of Maryland Medical Center. He was 63.  I had the privilege of working with Ken in his role as director of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science's Chesapeake Biological Laboratory on Solomons Island.  Ken's work made an invaluable contribution to the health and vibrancy of the Chesapeake Bay, and his leadership brought together marine scientists from around the world to bolster the health of coastal waterways.  While at Solomons, he led collaborative research programs involving marine scientists from the United States, the Galicia region of Spain and Portugal.  His frequent visits to both countries have helped build strong scientific relationships that endure today.  At the time of his death, he was leading the Navigator Project, an international effort supported by the National Science Foundation and the Luso-American Foundation, to characterize and compare the ecology of coastal seas around the world.  Ken's efforts while serving the University of Maryland, my alma mater, reflect a man deeply committed to preserving the Earth for future generations.  While Ken was passionate about advancing technology to make new discoveries in his discipline, he was also a man that followed a higher moral code--even teaching a science and ethics course at the University of Notre Dame.  Father Ernan McMullin, a retired Notre Dame professor said of Ken: ``He was an inspirational teacher who had a strong feeling for the philosophical and ethical issues in science.''  Among his tremendous accomplishments, Ken founded and directed the Alliance for Coastal Technologies, a partnership of research institutions, environmental managers, and industry representatives which foster sensor technologies for use in monitoring coastal environments.  Ken leaves behind a sister, Dr. Elizabeth J. Tenore, a brother, Louis James Tenore, and a nephew, Louis James Tenore Jr.  Ken's life touched so many around the world: family, friends, and colleagues. I was privileged to know him.  On behalf of the Fifth Congressional District, I want to extend my sympathies to his family and join the scores of others in honoring his life's work.                          ____________________
