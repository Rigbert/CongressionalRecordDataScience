I know the Senator presented a bill to create a national intelligence director long before it was popular to do so. She has been a leader in intelligence reform. She has made several very constructive and helpful suggestions and recommendations to the committee. We very much appreciate her leadership, and we consider it a great coup to have her support for our legislation.  I thank her for her hard work and her leadership. We look forward to continuing to work with her.
