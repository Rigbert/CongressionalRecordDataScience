President, I hope the Senator from Pennsylvania was listening when I said I mean nothing personal about it. I have a great deal of respect for him. When I talk about being thankful that I was not a lawyer at this time, I was talking about looking for ways, loopholes around this thing, so this procedure can take place.  I acknowledge to the Senator that on two occasions in my 60-year life I have needed lawyers and I was thankful to have them at that time.
