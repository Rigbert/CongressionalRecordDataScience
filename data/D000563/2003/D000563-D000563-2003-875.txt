Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, then Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, they came through and said, on a bipartisan basis, let us extend freedoms and opportunities to people in America who have been denied those opportunities; let us pass a Federal law--Congress passes it, and the President signs it--and establish opportunities for disabled Americans.  I think this is a good illustration of what happens with the Court when it goes too far in one direction. I ask the Senator from New York if he could give us an illustration of what happened with the Americans with Disabilities Act when it came to the highest court in the land when they had a chance to take a look at it and say whether we will protect disabled Americans and whether Congress had gone too far or not far enough, so that people can put in context what we are debating. Can the Senator give us an illustration of what happened with this law?
