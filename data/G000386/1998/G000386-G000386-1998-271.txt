 President, I am puzzled. In the last week or so, we have seen U.S. Customs' agents wrap up one of the most successful undercover operations in history. This effort, Operation Casablanca, has nailed a bunch of international bankers, mostly in Mexico, who have been laundering drug money. These white collar drug thugs have violated United States law, Mexican law, and international law. They have violated their trust. They have abetted one of the nastiest businesses on the planet. And they have conspired to do all of this to make an illegal dollar. Drug traffickers are bad enough. But their financial advisers and bankers are truly despicable. Thus, the Customs' undercover operation that exposed some of these low lifes is to be celebrated. My hat is off to the agents and informants that risked their lives to help defend our institutions and bring these pinstripe bandits to justice.  But I am still puzzled. What has me scratching my head is the reaction of the Mexican Government to this event. Instead of joining hands in congratulating efforts to protect the integrity of our international banking institutions and our shared concern to stop drug trafficking, what have they done. The Foreign Minister of Mexico has called the law enforcement people the criminals. She has raised the banner of so-called national sovereignty to provide cover to criminal activities of Mexican nationals. Mexico has called for the extradition of the law enforcement people in this operation, claiming they have violated Mexican law. What is wrong with this picture? Let me count the ways.  First, money laundering is the illegal act we are talking about. It is, by its nature, an activity without borders. It is also illegal in every legitimate country on the planet.  Second, the bankers in Mexico who engaged in laundering drug money, did so with knowledge of the illegality of their acts. They did so in a manner aimed at avoiding detection. They did so in defiance of bank regulations and Mexican law.  Third, these bankers engaged knowingly in using their expertise to violate United States law. And they provided the facilities of their banks to move money around the globe in violation of international law.  Fourth, we know they did this because it's on tape. We know they did it knowingly because the indictments spell it out.  Fifth, they used their expertise to try to improve the ease with which the money was laundered. They provided advice on how to avoid Mexican law.  They acted with criminal intent and used the interconnectivity of the modern banking system to hide their acts. They committed these acts in this country, in Mexico, and elsewhere, either in person or by using computers.  Now, the Foreign Secretary in Mexico would have it that in exposing these activities and in tracking the process, United States agents violated Mexican sovereignty and law. It would seem, in her view, that this means the undercover operatives committed criminal acts by engaging in money laundering. But in this country and most others, a criminal act involves intent. There is no criminal intent involved here by U.S. law enforcement. Just the reverse. Thus, law is not offended.  As to sovereignty, well, if we insist on this point, whose sovereignty is violated? Sovereignty is not meant to be a shield for criminality. It would be a fine world if that were the principle. It is not. I can think of few more useful tools for drug traffickers, money launderers, and thugs of every description than to find a safe haven in some country willing to use its sovereignty to harbor international criminality. What has happened here, is that bankers have violated the laws of this country by using the international banking system to freely commit crimes. They have done this in person in this country and they have done it electronically across borders. These are the criminals, not the law enforcement people who have corralled this gang of crooks.  But according to the Foreign Secretary of Mexico, it is the law enforcement folks who are to be labeled villains. In some of the most intemperate rhetoric I have seen from a senior government official, the Foreign Secretary not only castigates the good guys, but is calling for their extradition. I find this situation outrageous. I am equally concerned about the response from our own State Department. I have a letter here that our Secretary of State has sent to the Secretary of the Treasury. I will submit this for the Record. Instead of congratulating the law enforcement effort and joining hands with Secretary Rubin, Secretary Albright complains about inadequate consultation with Mexico. What is wrong with this picture?  Given the important steps Mexico and the United States have taken toimprove bilateral cooperation and to go after the real thugs in the story, I hope we can get past this case quickly. I hope the Foreign Secretary of Mexico and Secretary of State of the United States wake up and smell the coffee.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Secretary Albright to Secretary Rubin be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       The Secretary of State,                                     Washington, DC, May 22, 1998.     Hon. Robert Rubin,     Secretary of the Treasury.       Dear Mr. Bob: I know that both you and Attorney General      Reno are aware of the negative reaction in Mexico to the      announcement of Operation Casablanca and have had contact      with Mexican officials about this. I spoke May 21 with      Foreign Secretary Rosario Green who expressed her      government's deep resentment for not having been informed of      the operation prior to the public announcement. Other Mexican      officials have voiced concern that the activities undertaken      by U.S. agents in Mexico may have been illegal under Mexican      law or contrary to understandings between the United States      and Mexico.       Mexico's reaction is a product of many factors, not least      of which is great sensitivity within the Zedillo government      to preexisting charges from the opposition that it is      attempting to bail out a corrupt banking system. However, I      am concerned about the negative tone this development      introduces into the relationship and that Mexican cooperation      on several fronts, particularly counternarcotics, may be      affected.       We might have achieved more favorable results if we had      brought Attorney General Madrazo and a few others into our      confidence a few days before the public announcement. In this      regard, I believe State should have been consulted. We would      have been able to offer some advice that could have      ameliorated the negative reaction.       I would appreciate being kept personally informed of      developing investigations in Mexico and other foreign      countries that could have a significant foreign policy      fallout. I do not wish to interfere with your law enforcement      work, but I do believe we need to do a better job of      coordination.       It is essential that in the coming days you find ways in      your public statements and private contacts with Mexican      officials to indicate that we are actively working to avoid      similar difficulties in the future. I hope to discuss this      with you soon.           Sincerely,                                            Madeleine K. Albright.
