Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and celebration of the 50th birthday of a former employee, colleague and more importantly, friend on May 4, 2018.   Mr. Curtis Thayer of Anchorage, Alaska has worked tirelessly on behalf of Alaskans for over half of his very young 50 years. He has served his time in a wide variety of public service and private practice to bring Alaska economic development, jobs and a solid foundation of community.   Moreover, Curtis is a devoted husband, father and son who dedicates his life to his family and many charitable and non-profit organizations. In a very brief time, Curtis has completed more than most people could in three lifetimes and I have a tremendous amount of respect for him, even selling him one of my precious guns at one point in time. That never happens as I really love my guns--but I gave him a great deal.   Curtis has a great wit, a sharp mind, and sometimes a sharp tongue, but you can always count on him to be there for you. He epitomizes loyalty, honesty and courage. He has stood by my side through all of the political and personal ups and downs and I cannot thank him enough for all he has done for the great State of Alaska and for me as a politician and a person. He is just simply a great guy with an even better wife and son.   Mr. Speaker, Curtis's wife Josie and his son Matthew stand beside a great man who will have many more years to make Alaska an even better place to live. Fifty is just the beginning for this young man.   Happy birthday to my friend, Curtis W. Thayer.                          ____________________
