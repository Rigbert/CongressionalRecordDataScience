 President, I rise because our country has lost a true patriot. SGT Daniel W. Wallace of Dry Ridge, KY, was tragically killed by enemy fire while serving his country in Afghanistan on October 31, 2008. He was 27 years old.  A member of the Kentucky Army National Guard since 2006, Sergeant Wallace was on his first deployment. For his valor in uniform, he received several medals, awards and decorations, including the Bronze Star Medal and the Purple Heart.  ``Sergeant Daniel Wallace was a true patriot,'' says Kentucky National Guard Adjutant GEN Edward W. Tonini. He ``stood up and answered the call to serve his Nation in a time of need.''  Sergeant's Wallace's mother, Karen Wallace, says the same thing, but in a way only a mother could.  ``Danny's my fallen hero,'' she says.  Daniel's family lived in the town of Latonia in the northern Kentucky suburbs of Cincinnati, when he was young. When he was about 9 years old, they moved to Dry Ridge in Grant County.
