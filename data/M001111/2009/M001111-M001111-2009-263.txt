 President, the amendment that is now pending is an amendment that increases fire grant programs by $10 million. It is fully offset. The fire grant programs provide funds to equip, train, and hire our firefighters. The committee provided an increase in the bill because in 2007 there were over 20,731 applications, totaling $3.1 billion, and FEMA could only approve 5,132 of those applications due to limited funds.  I hope we can move quickly to a vote on this amendment. We wish to move forward. I know several Senators have amendments they wish to offer, and if we can move to a vote on this fairly quickly, I think everybody would be amenable to that.
