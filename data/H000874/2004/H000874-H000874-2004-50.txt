 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.  Within the last 2 weeks, the White House has submitted a request for emergency supplemental funds to deal with the damage caused by Hurricane Frances. The gentleman from Florida (Chairman Young) advises me that a revised request is on its way from the White House to account for Hurricane Ivan. Once we receive that request and complete assessing those needs, it is possible to move forward with a supplemental. Whether that be freestanding or included in some omnibus bill, I think, is too early to tell.
