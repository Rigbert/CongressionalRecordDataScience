 That includes the 1-year AMT patch omitted by the House bill that we had a vote on yesterday and extends the provisions that expired in 2007 for 2 years. This is a 1-yearlonger extension than in the House bill we had the vote on yesterday.  S. 3098 does not include any tax hikes, reflecting the position 41 Senators took in a letter to Senator Baucus on April 23 of this year.  Our Republican alternative also includes the Ensign-Cantwell energy tax incentives, which were approved by the Senate earlier this year, 88 to 8.  In addition, S. 3098 does not contain the New York City earmark. It also does not contain the tax break for trial lawyers. It also does not contain Davis-Bacon expansion. And it also would not be vetoed by the President.  On balance, this is a bill that could pass the Senate and get signed by the President. We hope to pass it as soon as possible.  Let me conclude my remarks by saying that my good friend on the other side of the aisle and I both know how we pass these bills--we pass them together. As he frequently said when he was in the minority and in a position similar to mine, we are not the House. We are the Senate. It is not going to work to turn the Senate into the House. We all know that. Both sides have tried it. We have been in the majority and the minority, and the minority always insists they be part of the process.  We have two important bills here that clearly need to be completed. We all know how to get there--bipartisan negotiation on the Medicare bill and bipartisan negotiation on the tax extender bill.  I yield the floor.
