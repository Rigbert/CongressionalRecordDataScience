Speaker, on Tuesday, September 8, 2015, I was not present due to a medical procedure and missed the following vote:  Roll Call Vote 490, On the Motion to Suspend the Rules and Pass H.R. 3154--S. 1359, The E-Warranty Act of 2015. I would have voted ``aye.''                          ____________________
