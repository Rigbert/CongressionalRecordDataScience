 But there are no remaining obstacles. All of the paperwork is done and has been finished forover a month. I hope my good friend from Virginia, and his colleague who supports the nominee who is of the other party, will continue to press the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the majority leader to move forward with a nominee who appears to me by all accounts to be about as noncontroversial as can be come up with. So I thank my colleague from Virginia.
