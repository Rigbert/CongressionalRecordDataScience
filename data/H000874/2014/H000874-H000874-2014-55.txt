Speaker, I rise to thank the majority leader for his service to this House and his service to this country.  When one of us leaves this body, it ought to remind us that all of us are here for a relatively short time, perhaps some longer than others, but all for a relatively short time.  Mr. Cantor and I have had the opportunity to work together. As he pointed out, we have not always agreed, as we do not always agree across the aisle. But we have an extraordinary honor bestowed upon us, as he pointed out. There are less than 11,000 of us in the history of this country who have served in this body. There are 435 of us who have been asked by our fellow citizens to serve on their behalf, on behalf of their families, and on behalf of their country.  Eric Cantor has done that well, not because I always agreed with him, but because I always knew that he had the best interest of his country, his State, his community, his family, and our neighbors in mind when he acted. I want to congratulate him and I want to thank him for his service, and I want to thank him for working with me on those areas where we could find agreement. In those areas, we acted in a very productive manner and created a large bipartisan majority on most of those issues in this House. I thank him for doing that.  As one who has also had the honor, Mr. Speaker, of serving as the majority leader of this House, it is a special honor that our colleagues have bestowed upon us. I want to wish him well. I know that he will not be leaving the public community, the public square, and his voice will still be a voice of influence and he will make a difference in whatever area he pursues. He will remain always a Member of this body. He will visit us from time to time. We will welcome him back. We wish him well.
