President, I am very upset that the Congress has been unable to pass legislation to prevent the termination of satellite television service to hundreds of thousands households in the United States. In September, I raised these concerns on the Senate floor in the hope of preventing these potential terminations of satellite service. The Senate Judiciary Committee got its job done in June. We reported out a great satellite television bill which would have expanded viewing options for satellite dish owners. The other body has also developed a very good satellite bill which I shall discuss in a moment.  However, history may repeat itself because Congress has not completed action on this legislation. I explained my concerns on the Senate floor when I reminded everyone that in ``1998 and 1999 over 2 million families were faced with the prospect of losing the ability to receive one or more of their satellite televisions network stations.''  These terminations of satellite service will begin just after midnight on December 31, 2004. The problem is that the Congress will be out of session during most of the time between now and that termination date. If we are in session for a small portion of that time, it will most likely be during a lame duck session of Congress after the November elections. There will be very little time to enact this satellite bill with the huge press of business yet to be completed.  Many Midwestern and Rocky Mountain states have vast areas where satellite dish owners receive network stations, such as ABC, NBC, CBS or Fox, from out-of-state stations because signals from their local stations are blocked by mountains or diminished by distance from TV broadcast towers. Thousands of these families do not have any other way to receive television signals except by satellite. They do not have access to TV stations over-the-air because mountain terrain blocks those signals, and distance from the broadcast towers weakens the signals. Many residents in those states do not have access to cable TV service because of the rough terrain or the low population density which makes it economically difficult for cable companies to invest in the needed cables. Without access to network stations via satellite because the satellite legislation did not pass, and because they do not receive service over-the-air, or via cable, thousands of families in those areas will lose national network service.  Since information about subscribers is proprietary it is difficult for me to tell you exactly how many families will be affected by this, but I assure you it is not a small number.  The Hatch-Leahy Satellite Home Viewer Extension Act of 2004 was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee in June. All the Members of the Judiciary Committee supported that bill. Similar legislation in the other body entitled the Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act of 2004, if enacted, would also be a boon to public television, the satellite industry, the movie, music and television industries, and to satellite dish owners throughout America. Unfortunately, the time is rapidly approaching when it will be too late to act.  I am especially pleased that both the Senate and the House, H.R. 4518, bills contain a provision which I worked on with my colleagues from New Hampshire, Senator Sununu and Senator Gregg. We, along with Senator Jeffords, introduced legislation to ensure that satellite dish owners in every county in each of our States would be able to receive signals, via satellite, from our respective in-State television stations. While our two States represent a small television market as compared to some of the major population centers, this provision is nonetheless very important to residents in six of our collective counties two in Vermont and four counties in New Hampshire. The Senate bill, S. 2013, as reported in June by the Judiciary Committee also contains this provision, which was just included in H.R. 4518, the House bill.  In Vermont this will mean if one of these bills passes--that satellite dish owners in Bennington and Windham Counties will be able to receive all Vermont network stations in addition to the out-of-State network stations they now receive.  The Senate bill was introduced on January 21, 2004, by Chairman Hatch and was cosponsored by myself and Senators DeWine and Kohl. When the bill was reported out of committee on June 17, 2004, I noted that the bill does far more than just protect satellite dish owners from losing signals. I pointed out that the new satellite bill ``protects subscribers in every state, expands viewing choices for most dish owners, promotes access to local programming, and increases direct, head-to-head, competition between cable and satellite providers.''  I continued by saying that, ``easily, this bill will benefit 21 million satellite television dish owners throughout the Nation, and I am happy to note that over 85,000 of those subscribers are in Vermont.''  The Senate Judiciary Committee-reported bill, and the recently passed bill H.R. 4518, go far beyond protecting what current subscribers receive. As I mentioned in a September statement on the Senate floor, the bills allow additional programming via satellite through adoption of the so-call ``significantly viewed'' test now used for cable, but not satellite subscribers. That test means that, in general, if a person in a cable service area that historically received over-the-air TV reception from ``nearby'' stations outside that area, those cable operators could offer those station signals in that person's cable service area. In other words, if you were in an area in which most families in the past had received TV signals using a regular rooftop antenna, then you could be offered that same signal TV via cable. By having similar rules, satellite carriers will be able to directly compete with cable providers who already operate under the significantly viewed test. This gives home dish owners more choices of programming.  In the past, Congress got the job done. Congress worked together in 1998 and 1999 when we developed a major satellite law that transformed the industry by allowing local television stations to be carried by satellite and beamed back down to the local communities served by those stations. This marked the first time that thousands of TV owners were able to get the full complement of local network stations. In 1997 we found a way to avoid cutoffs of satellite TV service to millions of homes and to protect the local affiliate broadcast system. The following year we forged an alliance behind a strong satellite bill to permit local stations to be offered by satellite, thus increasing competition between cable and satellite providers.  Because of those efforts, in Vermont and most other States, dish owners are able to watch their local stations instead of getting signals from distant stations. Such a service allows television watchers to be more easily connected to their communities as well as providing access to necessary emergency signals, news and broadcasts.  Mr. President, I hope we are able to work together to finish this important satellite television bill in the few remaining days of this Congress.                          ____________________
