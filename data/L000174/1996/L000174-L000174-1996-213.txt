President, today I join my distinguished colleagues in urging all of our colleagues, their staff, families, and friends, to join the thousands of individuals who will participate in this year's Race for the Cure. In years past, my wife and I have eagerly joined the throngs of people of all ages who run or walk, are pushed in strollers or push themselves in wheelchairs, who share one common goal: helping to raise money so that a cure can be found for the disease that has taken the lives of nearly 1 million of our sisters, daughters, wives, and mothers during the past 35 years. This has been one of the most important events in which we have participated over the years.  Since 1992, I have fought for increased funding for breast cancer because as lawmakers, it is our responsibility to provide the tools researchers need to find a cure. Many of us find ourselves fighting this insidious disease in our daily jobs, as lawmakers, scientists, researchers, doctors, and advocates. But as a husband, father, and friend, this race has been another way for me to show my support of the urgent need to stop the spread of breast cancer, of the courageous women who fought this disease and won, and finally, to honor the strong women who were simply unable to overcome the power of this disease.  I hope that everyone will heed the messages presented on the floor of the Senate and participate in this important event.
