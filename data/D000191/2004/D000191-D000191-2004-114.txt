Speaker, today Chinese Vice Premier Wu is in townmeeting with Commerce Secretary Evans and Trade Representative Zoellick. This would give the President a chance to right mistake number seven of his administration, which is trade. The United States last year ran over a $500 billion trade deficit. We have exported hundreds of thousands of manufacturing and now high-technology jobs outsourced under the Bush administration. And their response has been, from the President's chief economist Mr. Mankiw, this is a good thing, it is efficiency.  It is not a good thing. It is not efficiency. Americans need jobs. We need an economy. We need an industrial base. That is wrong-headed thinking.  So today they have got a chance in meeting with Vice Premier Wu to rectify the mistake of their trade policies. The mistake is at the insistence of President Bush, this Congress voted to give China, the Communist Government of China, permanent most favored nation or special trade status.  We gave up the right to annually review their compliance with trade laws. Big mistake. But the President said, Do not worry, I have a plan. Yes, he is right. They are stealing our products and our intellectual property left and right. Yes, they have violated five agreements on stealing our intellectual property and our products over the last 5 years or 7 years. But he had a plan. He was going to put them in the World Trade Organization because the President is big on rules-based trade.  So the President got his way. China is now in the World Trade Organization, and guess what? Last year, according to statistics of the Chinese Government, let alone our own government which will not talk about these things, they counterfeited and stole between $20- and $24 billion of U.S. products and intellectual property. Those are the numbers of the Communist Chinese Government about how much they are stealing.  Has the President filed one, one single complaint in his rules-based trade organization, the WTO, against the theft of product, property by the Chinese Government? No, not a single one. Yet I have a company in my district, Videx. Their company not only had their property stolen by China, they were totally cloned. The Chinese put up a fake Website to attract people with a little waving American flag on it, saying they were an American company, made an inferior product, have stolen the Chinese market, and now are stealing the Asian market from this American company.  I thought this is a no-brainer. The President likes rules-based trade. So I appealed to the Commerce Secretary and to the President. I said, help this company. They are not big enough to fight the Government of China. And the response was, no, we will not help that company because the big companies in the United States who are manufacturing in China do not care about the theft of property. In fact, they think it might hurt their interest in accessing cheap labor and avoiding environmental laws and outsourcing jobs to China. So the Bush administration will not lift a hand to help Videx. The only response we have gotten was Lou Dobbs and Moneyline, and after my company Videx was on Lou Dobbs and Moneyline, they got calls from all over America, from other small businesses who have been stolen blind by the Chinese Government. And the response of the Bush administration is to do nothing.  They are having meetings today with Vice Premier Wu. She is going to give them the same empty assurances the Chinese have given us for the last decade: Oh, we will stop stealing $24 billion a year worth of our product, sure. Do my colleagues believe that? I do not believe that, and I cannot believe that the President or his administration believes that. So what they should do today is tell the Chinese they are in the WTO, they said they would follow the rules, they are not, and that we are informing them today if they do not shape up by next week, then we are going to the WTO with complaints on the theft of products from Videx and dozens of other small companies across America.  This is an administration that supposedly cares about small business, yet when small business is being robbed blind by the Chinese, and big business says, hey, do not upset the Chinese apple cart, we are manufacturing really cheap over there, $1-a-day labor, now they might get upset with us, and they might charge us $1.25 a day for the labor over there, or they might even let them have a labor union or something else.  Help America's small business. Help them to fight the Communist Chinese Government. Help stop stealing America blind. Help stop stealing our industrial and intellectual base, and help turn around the international trade deficit. That is a mistake the President can begin to undo today in these conversations with Vice Premier Wu.                          ____________________
