Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I will ask for a colloquy with the gentleman from New York (Mr. Walsh), the distinguished chair of our subcommittee.  Mr. Chairman, as the chairman knows, I have an ongoing concern regarding the adequacy of HUD's programs for providing housing for the mentally ill. This year the committee is recommending level funding at $201 million for the Section 8-11 disabled housing program, and this is $9 million below the administration's request. These funds provide housing for both mentally and physically disabled people.  The administration's request estimated that 5,454 new housing units for the disabled would be available with this increase in funds. Would the chairman kindly tell me how many new units of housing for the disabled would be available under the committee bill?
