President, I spoke earlier in favor of the amendment of the Senator from South Carolina. While he is here, I again commend him for his effort, his leadership in this area, and for working with both the Homeland Security and the Commerce Committees to work out some technical issues. His amendment is going to make a big difference. All of us remember 5 years ago on this day how difficult it was to get information--our cell phones were not working; we did not have Blackberrys then. The Senator's approach will ensure that we use every possible means to inform the public when there is an incident that is a threat to public safety.  I salute the Senator for his leadership. This is an excellent proposal. I am pleased to support it.                        public safety promotion
