President, while the distinguished Senator from Connecticut is on the floor, I appreciate the last part of his remarks. I will speak more about it later today.  I am concerned that there has somehow been this strawman put up as though there is a religious test. As I and others stated at the beginning of these hearings and as I stated on the floor, one of the things I admire most about Senator Ashcroft is his commitment to his family, his commitment to his religion. As practically everybody has pointed out, whether we are for or against him as Attorney General, these are two things we have admired the most: his commitment to his family and his commitment to his religion. There should be no doubt about that in the public's mind.
