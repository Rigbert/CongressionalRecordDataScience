Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.  Mr. Chairman, in response to the previous speaker, it certainly is not what it was 15 years ago. We have spent $36 billion and the result is one faked missile test over the Pacific. They did not even shoot down that one incoming warhead. They had to blow it up with detonators that were on board. No, it is not what is was 15 years ago. It has wasted $36 billion and now they want to waste more.                              {time}  1515
