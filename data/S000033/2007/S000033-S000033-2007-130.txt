  Madam President, I rise to offer an amendment on behalf of myself, Senator Clinton, Senator Kerry, and Senator Biden.  Our amendment would strike section 277 of the Senate substitute, which is very broad language directing the Secretary of Labor to work with the Secretary of Energy to develop workforce training for the energy efficiency and renewable energy sectors, and replace it with a clearer directive regarding workforce development in those same areas.  Before I get too far along in the description of the amendment, I would like to thank Senators Bingaman and Domenici for including section 277 in the underlying bill. I think we all recognize the need to provide more workforce training in the areas of energy efficiency and renewable energy if we are to truly meet the challenge in front of us.  The amendment I offer today simply builds upon the language already included in the legislation we are considering, and so I hope it will receive the resounding support of this body. In other words, we had boilerplate language already in it, and we have built upon that. Up to this point, we have had strong bipartisan support.  This amendment would create a sustainable, comprehensive public program to provide quality training for jobs created through renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives--an area of our economy that is in tremendous need of expansion to meet the demand for a skilled workforce in these sectors.  Fundamentally, the amendment would do two basic things: One, expand our Nation's capacity to identify and track the new jobs and skills associated with the growing clean energy technology sector; secondly, develop national and State training programs to address skill shortages that have already begun to impair the expansion of clean energy and efficiency technologies.  More specifically, the amendment would authorize funding for national and State research on labor market trends in the energy efficiency and renewable energy sectors. Additionally, the amendment would provide competitive grants for national and Statetraining programs in the renewable energy and energy efficiency areas.  Entities eligible for grants are nonprofit partnerships that include equal participation of industry and labor groups, and there is explicit encouragement for the development of partnerships with other organizations such as community-based organizations, educational institutions, small businesses, cooperatives, State and local veterans agencies, and veterans service organizations.  Some of the target populations for the training programs include those who are veterans of the Armed Forces, those affected by national energy or environmental policies, those displaced by economic globalization, and those seeking pathways out of poverty and into economic self-sufficiency. The eligible industries include the energy-efficient building, construction, and retrofits industry; the renewable electric power industry; the energy-efficient and advanced drive train vehicle industry; the biofuels industry; and the deconstruction and materials use industries.  Some may ask whether we even have reason to believe we need training to increase the number of workers skilled in the areas targeted by this amendment. The answer is a resounding yes. We know the lack of trained workers is a significant barrier to the growth of the renewable and energy efficiency industries.  A 2006 study from the National Renewable Energy Lab identified the shortage of skills and training as a leading nontechnical barrier to renewable energy and energy efficiency growth. This same study identified a number of critical unmet training needs, including lack of reliable installation, maintenance, and inspection services, the shortage of key technical and manufacturing skills, and failure of the educational system to provide adequate training in new technologies.  All of those issues are addressed in this amendment. I can tell you from talking to the people on the ground, there is a real shortage of trained workers in these areas. In Vermont, if a family wants to retrofit and weatherize their home, it could take a very long time to make it happen because there are simply not enough workers out there trained to do the work. The same thing goes for installation of solar panels or wind turbines.  The widespread adoption of these technologies is being stopped in its tracks because we simply do not have enough people to do the jobs. But instead of talking about a study or listening to my experience from Vermont, let me actually offer testimonials from some of those who are most familiar with the need for the workforce development concepts I am proposing.  Let me quote Tim Michels, from Energy Solutions, Incorporated, from St. Louis, MO:       We have been saving energy for institutions for over 30      years. We typically find that we can reduce energy use 25+      percent with less than a 4 year payback, so it is very      economical and we have lots of case studies to prove it. The      limiting factor to our growth as an industry is lack of      qualified professionals to perform the analyses.  That is what we are trying to do: find the workers to do those types of efforts.  Lisa Mortensen, the CEO of Community Fuels, of Encinitas, CA, states:       Currently, we are constructing a 7.5 million gallon per      year biodiesel plant at Port of Stockton, California. As a      renewable energy start-up we have an intimate understanding      of the need for a high quality workforce. Skills in      mechanical operations, industrial hygiene and safety, quality      control and a wider understanding of energy production are      essential to a quality workforce. These skills are not easily      learned. With funding opportunities like the one proposed,      our company could work with local training institutions to      help develop a workforce prepared for the changing U.S.      landscape.  Christopher O'Brien, vice president for strategy & government relations, Sharp Electronics Corporation, of Mayway, NJ, writes:       Sharp Corporation is the world's leading producer of solar      photovoltaic equipment and has been the No. 1 producer since      2000. Sharp's solar manufacturing plant in Memphis is the      largest solar panel manufacturing facility in the U.S., with      annual production capacity of 64 Megawatts, comprised of      almost 400,000 solar panels. The 200 solar production workers      in Memphis are represented by IBEW Local 474. Sharp supports      the proposal for increased Federal funding for worker      training in solar and other renewable energy and energy      efficiency industries. . . . We have since 2003 trained and      certified over 1,681 workers. Additional Federal funding      support would help to accelerate the pace of this training      and would assure Sharp and other solar manufacturers that      there will be a reliable and professionally trained pool of      workers to deliver and install solar energy systems on      customers' homes and commercial buildings. . . .  Those are a few--just a few--of the testimonials that have come across my desk as I have worked on this amendment, but I do think they do a good job of making this issue real for those of us in the Senate.  Now, my colleagues may wonder why we need a specific program for training in energy efficiency and renewables. The answer is simple: While the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries use many skills that can be transferred from other industries, specific, additional skills are often needed to take maximum advantage of the newer energy technologies.  For instance, investments in training of building maintenance workers and building superintendents and engineers can improve the operation of today's heating and cooling systems by as much as 10 percent in large public and commercial buildings, according to the National Association of Energy Services Companies. Such training could save millions of dollars per year in energy costs in larger public or commercial buildings, not to mention reduce the emission of pollutants that add to global warming. Let me quote from two business leaders about the need for specific training in these areas.  Erik Larson, from Indie Energy, of Evanston, IL:       We are the first company in the Chicago area to develop      geothermal systems for commercial and residential      developments using in-house vertical drilling. . . . We      recognized right away that the skill sets required for a      geothermal operation were not available in current labor      markets.  Robert de Grasse, senior vice president of technical standards, AIMCO--America's largest owner of apartment complexes--of Denver, CO, writes:       I personally support the Energy Efficiency and Renewable      Energy Worker Training Program. AIMCO is expecting that      properly trained maintenance technicians will have      significant and measurable benefits; in particular with HVAC      systems and electric motors. Energy User News described the      energy and financial savings on HVAC for community colleges      in California was estimated from 6 percent to 19 percent of a      typical community college's energy bill; a direct result of      technical training.  There is no doubt in my mind this amendment could make a tremendous difference in our ability to implement concrete, on-the-ground strategies that help to address our energy challenges. Ensuring we have a workforce trained in the skills needed to implement bold energy efficiency and renewable energy policies will go a long way.  Before I yield the floor, I would like to read the long list of some of the organizations that support the Sanders-Clinton-Kerry-Biden amendment, and I ask unanimous consent that letters from the following groups be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                       NAESCO,                                     Washington, DC, June 7, 2007.     Re business leaders urge vote for Sanders-Clinton amendment          to promote workforce training for a new energy economy.     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: As a business association representing      leading companies working to build a new clean energy      economy, we strongly urge you to vote ``yes'' on an amendment      to the Energy Savings Act of 2007 (SB 1321) that will be      vital to our nation's energy security and to the fight      against global warming. Offered by Senators Sanders and      Clinton, the Amendment would establish an Energy Efficiency      and Renewable Energy Workforce Training Program at the      Department of Labor to ensure our country trains the      workforce needed to ensure continued robust growth of a new,      clean energy industry.       NAESCO's current membership of about 85 organizations      includes firms involved in the design, manufacture, financing      and installation of energy efficiency and renewable energy      equipment and the provision of energy efficiency and      renewable energy services in the private and public sectors.      NAESCO members deliver about $4 billion of energy efficiency      projects each year. NAESCO numbers among its members some of      the most prominent companies in the world in the HVAC and      energy control equipment business, including Honeywell,      Johnson Controls, Siemens, Trane and TAC/Tour Andover. Our      members also include many of the nation's largest utilities:      Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison, New York      Power     Authority, and TU Electric & Gas. In addition, ESCO members      include affiliates of ConEdison, Pepco Energy Services,      Constellation, PP, DMJM Harris and Direct Energy. Prominent      national and regional independent members include Custom      Energy, NORESCO, Onsite Energy, EnergySolve, Ameresco, UCONS,      Chevron Energy Solutions, Synergy Companies, Wendel Energy      Services, WESCO and Energy Systems Group. NAESCO member      companies have been delivering energy efficiency projects to      residential, commercial, institutional and industrial      customers across the country for the past twenty years.       The companies we represent are developing and deploying a      wide range of innovative clean energy technologies, utilizing      domestic biomass, wind, solar energy, geothermal power, fuel      cells, energy efficient technologies and services, and much,      much more. By 2025, these technologies could provide electric      power equal to half of all the electricity that our country      uses today. By 2030, our industries could replace 30% to 40%      of the petroleum our country now imports. By doing so, our      industries could make a significant contribution to curbing      global warming pollution, enhancing our nation's energy      security, and creating up to 5 million new jobs by 2025.       However, to achieve these goals, we must find enough      qualified, trained people to design, manufacture, install,      operate, and maintain a host of innovative renewable energy      and energy efficient technologies. Across the country, our      companies experience workforce shortages as one of the key      barriers to growth. Indeed, a recent literature review from      the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) identified the      shortage of skills and training as a leading non-technical      barrier to renewable energy and energy efficiency growth.       We believe that the $100 million dollars authorized by the      Sanders-Clinton Amendment is urgently needed to develop      national and state skill training programs that will prepare      workers technically for our emerging industries, as well as      to analyze market trends and demonstrate best practices.      While the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries      use many skills that can be transferred from other sectors,      in many other cases, our companies require specific, new      skills to take maximum advantage of the newer energy      technologies. By establishing a pilot program specifically      geared toward the renewable energy and efficiency industries,      the Sanders-Clinton Amendment would enable us to build the      workforce our industries need to achieve their maximum      potential.       Our companies stand ready to help our country with new      energy technologies that will make us all more secure, curb      the threat of global warming, and create economic opportunity      for millions of working Americans. We urge you to vote      ``yes'' on the Clinton-Sanders Amendment as a crucial step      toward achieving these vital objectives.           Sincerely,                                               Donald D. Gilligan,     President.                                  ____                                           Center for American                                         Progress Action Fund,                                     Washington, DC, June 9, 2007.     Senator Bernard Sanders,     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.     Senator Hillary Clinton,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Sanders and Clinton: I write to express my      strong support for the proposed Sanders-Clinton Energy      Efficiency and Renewable Energy Worker Training Program that      will be offered as an amendment to the upcoming energy bill,      and to encourage other Senators to join in support of this      provision as co-sponsors. This is a critically important      energy and jobs measure that will help to ensure both      America's future energy and economic security.       As our nation confronts the twin challenges of our      escalating energy dependence and a mounting climate crisis,      we are presented by a remarkable opportunity to meet these      pressing demands with new more efficient and ever cleaner      sources of energy. This ``energy opportunity'' represents a      chance to rebuild our communities, to better train our      workers, and to reinvest in the basic infrastructure of the      nation. This amendment takes a significant step forward in      meeting the practical need to ensure that American firms and      workers have the cutting edge skills to participate in the      growing market for clean and efficient energy, and to capture      the jobs of the future.       Even as wind and solar energy experience explosive annual      growth rates, the utility industry is facing retirement of      half its workers within the decade, while the National      Renewable Energy Lab has identified a shortage of skilled      workers as a major barrier to deployment of renewable and      efficient energy. This amendment strategically invests      $100,000,000 dollars into a more robust labor market and      skills training that will prepare up to 30,000 workers to      jump start these booming industries that America invented.      This is a smart investment in a safer, more prosperous, and      more competitive U.S. economy.       By enhancing the workforce investment system, and working      with state governments, non-profit community groups, and both      labor and management, this amendment offers an efficient path      forward for the American economy. Targeting workers displaced      by shifting energy policies, enhanced skills for returning      veterans, pathways out of poverty for those most in need of      work, and a reliable labor market for both small business and      heavy industry represents a sound investment in the future.      This amendment will help build a state of the art economy and      expand markets for renewable energy, good jobs in      construction and building trades, and job security for the      U.S. auto industry. Thank you for your leadership on this      issue. The Center for American Progress Action Fund salutes      your vision, and offers its full support for this important      measure.           Sincerely,                                                  John D. Podesta,     President and CEO.                                  ____                                                    June 11, 2007.     Re support the Sanders-Clinton amendment on worker training          for the clean energy economy.     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: As representatives of the environmental,      energy efficiency, and clean energy advocacy communities, we      urge you to vote for an amendment to the Renewable Fuels,      Consumer Protection, and Energy Efficiency Act of 2007 (S.      1419) that will train working Americans for high-skilled jobs      in the emerging, clean energy economy. Sponsored by Senators      Sanders and Clinton, the amendment would create an Energy      Efficiency and Renewable Energy Workforce Training Program at      the Department of Labor to train workers in the skills our      country needs to make the most of new investments in clean,      renewable energy and energy-saving technologies.       As Congress advances programs to enhance our energy      security and address global warming, workforce shortages have      emerged as one of the top barriers to the new energy economy.      Indeed, a 2006 study from the National Renewable Energy Lab      identified a shortage of skills and training as a leading      barrier to renewable energy and energy efficiency growth.       The program established by the Sanders-Clinton Amendment      would help ensure that our nation develops the best models      for training workers in the new skills required to properly      manufacture, install, maintain, and operate clean energy      technologies. Grant funding under the program could, for      instance, train wind-industry workers in such new skills as      turbine siting, airfoil repair, and weather patterns that      affect turbine performance. Investments in training of      building maintenance workers, superintendents, and engineers      could improve the operations of sophisticated heating and      cooling systems by as much as 10 percent, saving millions in      energy costs each year in large public, industrial, or      commercial buildings.       Of crucial importance, the Sanders-Clinton amendment      provides working Americans with a clear pathway to earn a      family-supporting livelihood in the emerging, new energy      economy. We enthusiastically embrace this amendment for      signaling that America is, at last, ready to replace the old      debate of ``jobs vs. the environment'' by investing in ``jobs      for the environment.''       Thank you for considering our request to co-sponsor this      vital amendment. If you have any questions about this      legislation, please feel free to contact Jessica Maher in      Sen. Sanders' office.           Sincerely,     Kateri Callahan,       President, Alliance to Save Energy.

Dear Senator: I am writing to request your support for an      amendment to be offered by Sen. Sanders to S. 1419 the      ``Energy Savings Act of 2007.''       The Sanders amendment would establish the Energy Efficiency      and Renewable Energy Worker Training Program to train workers      for good-paying jobs in clean energy design, manufacturing,      installation, construction, operation, and maintenance. This      program would help U.S. workers get good jobs in an industry      expected to experience rapid growth as our nation refits and      rebuilds its energy infrastructure, and would help the U.S.      economy take advantage of emerging environmental      technologies.       To ensure that the benefits from new investments in our      national energy infrastructure are distributed equitably, the      Sanders amendment would give priority to partnerships that      train veterans, workers displaced by globalization or      environmental policies, and disadvantaged workers and      communities. In addition, to allow for the delivery of      training unique to specialized geographic and industry needs,      the Sanders amendment balances grants between national,      regional, and state workforce development programs.       As Congress considers legislation designed to reduce our      country's reliance on foreign sources of fossil fuels, we      believe it should also invest in the domestic workforce.      American workers should have every opportunity to acquire the      skills necessary for job opportunities that will be created      by new investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy      industries.       The AFL-CIO strongly urges you to support and cosponsor the      Sanders amendment. To become a cosponsor, please call Jessica      Maher in Sen. Sanders' office. If you have any other      questions or need any further information, please contact      David Mallino in the AFL-CIO's Department of Legislation.

Re co-sponsor the Sanders-Clinton amendment on workforce          development for the new energy economy     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: I write to urge you to co-sponsor an      amendment that Senators Sanders and Clinton will offer during      the upcoming debate on S. 1419, the Renewable Fuels, Consumer      Protection, and Energy Efficiency Act of 2007, that would      help America develop the specialized workforce skills needed      to ensure robust growth of the renewable energy and energy      efficiency industries. The Sanders-Clinton Amendment would      establish an Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Workforce      Training Program to be administered by the Department of      Labor (DOL) in coordination with the Department of Energy.       The purpose of this initiative is twofold--to expand our      nation's capacity to identify and track the new jobs and      skills associated with the growing energy technology sector      and to develop national and state skill training programs      that will demonstrate best practices in addressing skill      shortages that have already begun to impair the expansion of      energy technologies that are crucial to national security,      economic competitiveness, and curbing global warming.       Industries eligible for training services under the program      would include: energy-efficient building, construction, and      retrofits; renewable electric power; advanced automotive      drive trains; advanced bio-fuels; and the deconstruction and      materials use industries.       As Congress advances programs to enhance our energy      security and address global warming, workforce shortages are      emerging in the utilities sector that could stymie growth of      the renewable energy and efficiency industries. According to      the American Public Power Association, half of current      utility workers will retire within the next decade. However,      our nation is not training enough new workers to fill their      places. For instance, the number of high school graduates      with technical training has declined by 35 percent over the      last decade.       Already, the renewable and energy efficiency industries are      feeling the pinch. A 2006 study from the National Renewable      Energy Lab (NREL) identified the shortage of skills and      training as a leading non-technical barrier to renewable      energy and energy efficiency growth. In particular, the NREL      study identified a number of critical unmet training needs,      including lack of reliable installation, maintenance, and      inspection services, the shortage of key technical and      manufacturing skills, and failure of the educational system      to provide adequate training in new technologies.       Leading companies in the renewable energy and efficiency      sector experience lack of skilled workers as a key business      constraint. According to Steve Cowell, CEO and Chairman, of      Conservation Services Group (CSG), a leading provider of      building efficiency and renewable energy services, ``the      growth of the industry is constrained by the challenges of      finding experienced, trained people. . . . CSG has identified      this issue as our . . . industry's most significant      constraint on growth.''       The program established by the Sanders-Clinton Amendment      would help ensure that our nation has the best models for      training workers in the many new skills required to properly      manufacture, install, maintain, and operate clean energy      technologies. For instance, grant funding provided under the      amendment could train workers in such substantial new skills      as wind turbine siting, airfoils and composite repair, and      weather patterns that affect turbine performance.       While the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries      use many skills that can be transferred from other      industries, specific, targeted skill enhancements are often      needed to take maximum advantage of the newer energy      technologies. For instance, investments in training of      building maintenance workers and building superintendents and      engineers can improve the operations of today's sophisticated      heating and cooling systems by as much as 10 percent in large      public and commercial buildings, according to the National      Association of Energy Services Companies. Such training could      save millions of dollars per year in energy costs in larger      public or commercial buildings.       The Sanders-Clinton amendment is unique among many of the      new energy polices that Congress will consider for providing      a pathway for working Americans to earn a family-supporting      livelihood in our new energy economy. This Amendment honors      the sacrifice of our veterans by including them among groups      targeted for training. In addition, the Amendment helps to      tap the full range of our nation's human capital by offering      training opportunities to those displaced by national energy      and environmental policy, economic globalization, individuals      seeking pathways out of poverty, formerly incarcerated,      adjudicated and non-violent offenders who seek to play a      constructive role in society, and incumbent workers in the      energy field needing to update their skills.       The $100 million authorized by the Sanders-Clinton      Amendment is needed to implement programs of sufficient size      and scale to achieve the dual goals described previously--     enhanced labor market information as well as national and      state demonstration training programs. The Amendment would      authorize up to $40 million in grants on a competitive basis      under a National Training Partnerships program and up to $40      million in grants to states to implement labor exchange and     training programs. Preference would be given to states that      show leadership in promoting renewable energy, energy      efficiency, and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.      Eligible entities would include non-profit organizations that      are composed of partnerships between industry and labor,      taking advantage of established programs in order to ensure      the highest-quality training possible. The Sanders-Clinton      amendment also provides funding for national and State      industry-wide research, labor market information, and labor      exchange programs.       Using the average costs of attending a community college,      we estimate that funding would be sufficient to train between      20,000 and 30,000 workers per year. These numbers represent      just a small fraction of the 3 million workers that would be      needed, according to our own estimates, if the country      launched an ambitious ten-year Apollo-like effort to build a      new energy future. However, we believe it is prudent to begin      with a pilot program on the scale proposed by Senator Sanders      to ensure we fully understand the kinds of training needed      and future workforce trends before investing in a larger      effort.       Worker training, we believe, will be crucial to the wider      market penetration of innovative renewable energy and energy      efficient technologies. With passage of the Sanders-Clinton      Amendment, businesses can, for instance, have greater      confidence that an expensive solar array or geothermal heat      pump will be properly installed, reducing the perceived risks      of investing in relatively unfamiliar technologies. As skills      improve, costs will come down. That will, in turn, pave the      way toward making renewables and efficiency a core component      of our country's energy mix.
