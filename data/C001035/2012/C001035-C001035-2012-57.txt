President, today I wish to offer my congratulations to John T. Cyr and Sons, Inc., on its 100th anniversary. This outstanding Maine company demonstrates why family businesses are so important to our Nation's economy and to communities in every State. The determination and vision that led to a century of success define America's entrepreneurial spirit.  Sometime around 1903, John Thomas Cyr moved his family from Caribou, ME--my hometown--to Old Town, near Bangor, where he found work in a lumber mill. Nine years later, in 1912, at the age of 51, John T. Cyr struck out on his own. Joined by his son, Joseph, they started a livery stable and delivery business.  What began with horses, buggies, and wagons is today a thriving enterprise of 22 luxury motor coaches, 200 schoolbuses, and nearly 250 employees. A company that got its start hauling lumber for a local canoe factory now serves 17 school districts across Maine with an exemplary safety record. They offer tours throughout the United States and Canada--from New York City at Christmas to Washington, DC, in cherry blossom season. As a native of Aroostook County, I know how valuable their daily intercity service is to the towns and cities of northern Maine.  Handed down and nurtured through the generations, this is a true family business, owned and operated by the founder's grandson, Joe Cyr, joined by his brother, Pete, son Mike, and daughter Becky.  Their remarkable story of growth, of meeting challenges, and of delivering value was expertly told in a recent article in Maine Trails magazine. I would like to complement that account with my personal observations.  Before coming to the Senate, I worked at Husson University in Bangor, where I had the pleasure of getting to know Joe Cyr, class of 1962, and his wonderful wife Sue, class of 1965. Joe has been a longtime member of the Husson Board of Trustees, and Sue has been a volunteer supporter of uncommon energy. Joe and Sue's generosity to Husson includes significant gifts to athletic programs, a new home for the university president, the annual fund, and most recently, the new Cyr Alumni Center. The countless ways they serve--from the Boys Scouts and the Y to St. Joseph Hospital--touch people of all ages.  People throughout Maine are fortunate to have such a family as the Cyrs,but I am especially lucky--my summer camp on Cold Stream Pond is just down the road from theirs. As much as I cherish our time together, having dinner, playing cards, and enjoying the beautiful Maine summer evenings, I cherish even more being in the presence of those who give so much to others and who see the act of giving as the greatest reward. I am delighted to extend my congratulations to the Cyr family in their business's centennial year and to thank them for their contributions to the State of Maine.                          ____________________
