 President, if I could proceed to that other speech. If there are people from the other party, from the majority party, who come to the Chamber, I will be glad to yield the floor at the time of their appearance.  (The remarks of Mr. Grassley pertaining to the introduction of S. 458 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')                          ____________________
