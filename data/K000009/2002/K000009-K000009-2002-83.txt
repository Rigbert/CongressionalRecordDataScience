 I want to talk about fiscal responsibility, responsibility to our Nation, responsibility to the future, responsibility to our children, responsibility to our senior citizens.  Hubert Humphrey used to place particular emphasis on those Americans who are in the dawn of life and those who are in the twilight of life. I also rise to talk about fiscal responsibility to our veterans who have sacrificed and are sacrificing so much to keep freedom's flame burning brightly in America and throughout the world.  Last week the Congressional Budget Office reported that the President's budget spends $1.63 trillion of the Social Security trust fund surplus over the next 10 years. That is $261 billion more than the administration initially claimed. The budget office also reports that the President's policies spend Social Security trust fund money in every single year for the foreseeable future.  We have heard the administration officials, and some Republican leaders are extremely unhappy with the Congressional Budget Office for telling the truth; but that is why we have a Congressional Budget Office, to provide nonpartisan information, whether we like the results or not. We rely on it to be factual.  Tomorrow, Madam Speaker, this body will take up the President's budget for fiscal year 2003, and the unfortunate reality is that the President's policies will lead to the exhaustion of the entire Social Security trust fund surplus for the next 10 years and then some, according to the House Committee on the Budget minority staff.  The administration does this by using off-the-books accounting. We learned from the Enron-Arthur Andersen scandal that off-the-books accounting can get us into big trouble in a hurry. Indeed, even the administration admits that it spends some of the Social Security surplus despite Republican promises last year they would protect 100 percent of the Social Security trust fund surplus.  Remember the lock box promise? Well, the Republicans have picked the lock and are proceeding to take our money out of the lock box every day, money that belongs to the senior citizens of this country.  The Bush administration inherited a $5.6 trillion surplus; but now 8 months later, $4 trillion is gone and that jumps to $5 trillion next year if we take their budget on its word.  Madam Speaker, this is the most radical fiscal reversal in American history. The budget surplus is exhausted, deficits are back, and the lock box is gone.  What does it mean? For one thing it means that Congress may not be able to provide relief for the Medicare providers who are facing deep cuts in reimbursement.                              {time}  2000  It means veterans will have to pay more for prescription drugs. The Veterans Administration is proposing to raise the copayment for veterans by 250 percent.  It means the wealthiest Americans will continue to get giant tax cuts, but American's 35 million senior citizens will not get a prescription drug benefit.  It means that programs for women, infants, and children will be endangered. For the people in the dawn of life and the twilight of life, this budget gives the back of its hand, and it is not right.  Over the 5-year period from 1996 to 2000, Enron paid no taxes for 4 of the last 5 years and received a net tax rebate of $381 million. This includes a $278 million rebate in the year 2000 alone. Over the same period, the company's profits, before Federal income taxes, totaled $1.785 billion. Just their profits. In none of those years was the company's pretax profit less than $87 million. At the 35 percent tax rate, Enron's tax on profits in the last 5 years should have been $625 million. But the company was able to use tax benefits from stock options and other loopholes to reduce its 5-year tax to substantially less than zero. Among the loopholes that Enron used to avoid tax liability was the creation of more than 800 subsidiaries in tax havens such as the Cayman Islands.  Madam Speaker, is it any wonder that we cannot do the right thing for America's children, for America's veterans, and America's seniors? Is it any wonder that this Congress cannot act responsibly? Is it any wonder that the Social Security trust fund is being violated every day, even as I speak here?  As long as the big campaign contributors call the shots in Washington, we are going to see continued raids on the lockbox, and the American people are going to have to pay the bills that Enron, with an assist from the politicians, avoided.  The responsible vote tomorrow on the budget resolution is ``no.''                          ____________________
