 I hope my wife was listening to that. What the heck.  We have been working together, and we have to continue that to make the process work, to reach out to each other. Gosh, it is hard work. Senator Leahy and I differ on a lot of things, but we are together on bringing regular order to the Appropriations Committee because I thought all along we owe it to the American people. We are accountable--both parties, both groups. That is what we have been about.  Thank you again to the leader and Senator Schumer for your kind remarks.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hyde-Smith). The Senator from Vermont.
