 Speaker, for almost two decades Janet Bullard has been the program manager and office manager for the Vermont Commission on Women. Her tireless and inspired work for the Commission, work done for the betterment of the conditions in which women in the State of Vermont live and for the expansion of opportunities available to women, has recently been recognized by a signal honor.  On April 12 in Washington, DC, Janet Bullard was recognized by the Small Business Administration as the National Women in Business Champion of the Year. The competition for this award was nationwide. Janet first won the Vermont State award, then the New England Regional Award, and finally prevailed over a group of remarkably qualified women nationally. The SBA's award is bestowed on a person who has been an advocate for the women-owned business community, who has expanded the business and financial opportunities for women, and who has helped strengthen the role played by business owners in the community.  Janet, a resident of Chelsea, Vermont, has worked for the Vermont Commission of Women for 19 years, almost half of its existence. Established in 1964 by Governor Phil Hoff, the Commission has been an advocate for women and their rights and opportunities for 42 years. It consistently, and with great success, has been the primary advocate in the State of Vermont for the economic, social and political equality of women.  Janet Bullard has championed the rights of women, opened new doors for women, helped bring women together so that they can learn and strategize and about how to succeed in an economic world formerly dominated almost exclusively by men. And her involvement is concrete and financial as well: she has helped women get loans so they can establish businesses. In addition, for the last 10 years she has also worked to get funding for Vermont domestic violence and sexual assault programs.  Society changes more through dedicated work than through speeches, more by enduring commitments than by public appearances. For 19 years, Janet Bullard has worked tirelessly--a labor of love--to improve the status and business opportunities of women in the State of Vermont. Her dedication, and her remarkable ability to get things done, has left its mark on generations of women in our State.  I want to call particular attention to her work with Vermont's community action agencies, her unceasing effort to develop ways to help women start businesses with the aid of micro-loans. She has helped, time and again, leverage State and independent organization funds, and Federal funds, to help women--and especially low-income women--get a start in business.  Here is how Wendy Love, Executive Director of the Vermont Commission on Women described Janet's work the other day: ``Janet has an outstanding history with the Commission for almost 20 years, and has shown great dedication to the Commission and to helping women. She has really been a major voice for women's economic opportunity in Vermont. Every time we talk about doing something, she is five steps ahead. Janet has been a glue, helping bind together the folks who work at the community action agencies in micro-business development, and the people who work for the Federal Government at the Small Business Development Center.''  We in Vermont are delighted with the honor bestowed upon Janet Bullard: It is richly deserved.                          ____________________
