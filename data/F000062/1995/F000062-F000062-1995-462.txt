 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Augusta Wolfe who will celebrate her 100th birthday on March 2. Augusta has been a resident of California for 62 years and when she and her friends and family gather to celebrate, I want her to know she has been honored by the U.S. Senate.  Raised in New York City until age 17, Augusta had three sisters and five brothers. Her mother died when Augusta was only 13 and she assumed much of the responsibility and care of her younger siblings. Her father remarried and she acquired one half-sister.  Her older brothers moved to Winnipeg, Canada. At age 17, Augusta joined them, then sent for the three younger brothers and one sister. While in Winnipeg, Augusta worked in her brother's store.  At age 19, she met and married her brother's friend, Nathan Wolfe, and had two children. Two years later the family moved to Salt Lake City, UT, where they lived for 14 years. During this time, Augusta helped Nat found and operate a very successful retail business, Wolfe's Dept. Store. Mr. Chairman, In 1933, because Nat's health was failing, they moved to Beverly Hills and later to Palm Springs.  After Nat's death in 1952, Augusta returned to New York City for a brief period and then to Santa Barbara. She devoted much of her energy to creative art, primarily the making of mosaics. Later, she moved to Laguna Hills, CA, where she continued her interest in art and began writing poetry, which she continues to do until this date. Her work has been recognized by the National Library of Poetry and some of it has been published in their publication ``Tears of Fire.''  Today she is active and in relatively good health. Her keen intellect and memory are unimpaired. She lost her daughter in 1979. In addition to her son, Bernard, a California lawyer, she has many devoted friends and relatives who will attend her 100th birthday celebration on March 4, 1995.                          ____________________
