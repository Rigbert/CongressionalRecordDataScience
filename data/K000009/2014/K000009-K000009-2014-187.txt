Speaker, I rise today in recognition and honor of all veterans on this Memorial Day, celebrated on Monday. In gratitude of all freedom lovers who made our freedom and our ability to stand on this floor today as a free people possible--in particular the 400,000 men and women who gave their lives and the 16.5 million men and women who served during World War II.  This Memorial Day is particularly poignant as it is the 10th anniversary of the dedication of the World War II Memorial on the Mall. And on June 6th, we commemorate the 70th anniversary of the invasion of 150,000 Allied troops' landing on the heavily-fortified coastline of Normandy, France--D-Day.  On this year of anniversaries, as we think about the importance of this Memorial's place in American history, let us remember the significance of what these greatest Americans, this greatest generation of Americans, did for the freedom of humankind.  When we dedicated the memorial in 2004, more than four million of the 16 million American veterans of World War II were still alive. Today, fewer than a million remain. We lose more than 500 of them every day. And ten years from now, at the 20th anniversary ceremony, only 80,000, roughly, will survive.  At the memorial, what Abraham Lincoln called ``the mystic chords of memory'' are played with grandeur and grace. And that is what the memorial is all about. It was built to preserve a memory--  The memory of gallantry and devotion, of honor and sacrifice, of dedication to a cause bigger than oneself.  The memory of a generation of ordinary Americans who did something extraordinary--answering duty's call, saving democracy, and then modestly returning to their communities and their families, to work in the factory, to work on the farm . . . or simply to carry the mail.  The World War II Memorial will be there long after the World War II veterans are gone. While they are still with us, take the opportunity to let them know that a grateful nation will always pay tribute to their courageous service and they will always be remembered as heroes.  Mr. Speaker, let us not forget the valor, fidelity, and sacrifice of all World War II participants, and those who served in the conflicts that followed.                          ____________________
