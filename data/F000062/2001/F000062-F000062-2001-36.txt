 We believe this should be under the auspices of the Homeland Security Director, that these decisions need to be made rapidly, and that we need to get cracking to close the loopholes that have made the United States of America one giant sieve.  This bill, which I am so happy to support, takes a giant step forward in that direction. I thank both the chairman of the committee and the ranking member for their diligence on this bill.  I yield the floor.
