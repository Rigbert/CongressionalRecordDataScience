 Inhofe):  S. 557. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to exclude beverage alcohol compounds emitted from aging warehouses from the definition of volatile organic compounds; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.  the clean air act amendments distilled spirits clarification act of                                   1997  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation which will correct an oversight in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. This legislation will clarify the treatment under the act of beverage alcohol compounds emitted from aging warehouses.  Under the current statute, EPA classifies beverage alcohol emissions (ethanol) as a volatile organic compound [VOC]. VOC's react in the atmosphere to form ozone. Ethanol, however, has been proven to play an insignificant role in ozone formation because of its low reactivity.  Despite scientific evidence proving the minimal value of these controls (at exorbitant cost) the EPA has wrongly refused repeated requests regarding removal of restrictions on beverage distillation. If control technology is implemented, this would mean process changes in the historical aging process that makes each beverage unique.  Aging is arguably one of the most important components of the production process. For example, Bourbon whisky, which is a distinctive product of the United States, and Kentucky, must be aged at least 2 years in wooden barrels according to Federal regulation. This process involves natural oxidation which requires the passage of air and ethanol vapors into and out of the barrels. Any effort to alter this natural aging process through controls on temperature, ventilation patterns, and humidity, could change the actual physical properties of Bourbon whisky, thus altering the distinguishing taste associated with certain brands.  Mr. President, I agree that we must protect the environment that we all share. However, when extremist, inflexible regulation threatens an entire industry at minimal, if any, environmental return, we must reevaluate our priorities. I urge my colleagues to join me in restoring a little sanity to our regulatory process.  I ask unanimous consent for the bill to be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows:                                 S. 557       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. DEFINITION OF VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS.       Section 302(s) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7602(s)) is      amended by adding the following at the end thereof: ``Such      term shall not include beverage alcohol compounds (ethanol)      emitted from aging warehouses.''.                                 ______                                       By
