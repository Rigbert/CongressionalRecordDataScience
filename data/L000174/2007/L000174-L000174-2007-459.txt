President, I am pleased the Senate is considering today a bipartisan resolution to designate May 15, 2007, as National Peace Officers Memorial Day that Senator Specter and I introduced along with the majority leader, and Senators Biden, Grassley, Cornyn, Stabenow, Menendez, Durbin, Kohl, Kennedy and Brownback. Last week, the Judiciary Committee favorably reported this resolution unanimously. I thank all members of the Judiciary Committee and the cosponsors on this bipartisan resolution for their support in recognizingthe sacrifices that law enforcement officers make each day for the American people.  This is now the eleventh year running that I have been involved in this resolution to honor the sacrifice and commitment of those law enforcement officers who give their lives serving their communities. For many years I introduced this resolution with my friend Senator Campbell, a former deputy sheriff. Both Senator Campbell, and I, as a former prosecutor, witnessed firsthand the risks faced by law enforcement officers every day while they serve and protect our communities. I am pleased that Senator Specter, himself a former prosecutor, former chair of the Judiciary Committee, and now our ranking member, has become the lead Republican sponsor of this bipartisan measure.  Currently, more than 870,000 men and women who guard our communities do so at great risk. After the hijacked planes hit the World Trade Center in New York City on September 11, 2001, 72 peace officers died while trying to ensure that their fellow citizens in those buildings got to safety. That act of terrorism resulted in the highest number of peace officers ever killed in a single incident in the history of our country, and is a tragic reminder of how important it is for the Congress to provide all of the resources necessary to protect officers in the line of duty.  Since the first recorded police death in 1792, there have been more than 17,900 law enforcement officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice. We are fortunate in Vermont that we rank as the State with the fewest officer deaths in history. With 19 deaths, however, that is 19 deaths too many. In 2006, 147 law enforcement officers died while serving in the line of duty, well below the decade-long average of 165 deaths annually, and a drop from 2005 when 156 officers were killed. That is 147 officers too many. We need to continue our support for better equipment and the increased use of bullet-resistant vests, improved training, and advanced emergency medical care. I hope as the 110th Congress moves forward that all Senators can work together to ensure that all of our law enforcement officers and their families have the full support and the resources they need from the Federal Government.  I am proud of the work I have been involved in to help make it safer on the beat for our officers. Back in 1998, Senator Campbell and I authored the Bulletproof Vest Grant Partnership Act in response to the tragic Carl Drega shootout on the Vermont-New Hampshire border, in which two State troopers who lacked bulletproof vests were killed. Since then, we have successfully reauthorized this program three more times: In the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000, in the State Justice Institute Reauthorization Act of 2004, and most recently as part of the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005. It is now authorized at $50 million per year through fiscal year 2009 to help State, tribal and local jurisdictions purchase armor vests for use by law enforcement officers. I have already begun to work with my colleagues to make sure that the bulletproof vest partnership grant program is fully funded this year. Bulletproof vests have saved the lives of thousands of officers and are a fundamental line of defense that no officer should be without. I know I am not alone in calling for the Senate to fully fund the bulletproof vest partnership program and I hope the Congress agrees that it is crucially important that we provide the funding authorized for this program. Hundreds of thousands of police officers are counting on us.  I am also pleased to join with Senator Reed and others to introduce the Equity in Law Enforcement Act, which will provide parity in Federal benefits for law enforcement officers working in private educational institutions and for our Nation's rail carriers. Among these benefits are access to grants under the bulletproof vest partnership, and survivor benefits. All of the men and women who serve our society as law enforcement officers should be equally entitled to all of the benefits the Federal Government provides, no matter where they serve.  I think we can all agree that the men and women in law enforcement who have sacrificed for our safety deserve our deep gratitude and respect. National Peace Officers Memorial Day will offer the people of the United States, in their communities, in their State capitals, and in the Nation's Capital, the opportunity to honor and reflect on the extraordinary service and sacrifice given year after year by our police forces.  Our Nation's law enforcement officers deserve our commitment to protect those who help keep us all safe. They are the real-life heroes; too many of whom too often make the ultimate sacrifice. It is important to support and respect our State and local police officers and all of our first responders, and to recognize their role in upholding the rule of law and keeping our Nation's citizens safe and secure. During the week of May 13, more than 20,000 peace officers are expected to gather in Washington to join with the families of their fallen comrades. I thank the Senate for joining in honoring their service and passing this bipartisan resolution.  The amendment (No. 1007) was agreed to, as follows:                           Amendment No. 1007       On page 2, strike the first whereas clause and insert:       Whereas peace officers are on the front lines in protecting      the schools and schoolchildren of the United States;  The resolution (S. Res. 162), as amended, was agreed to.  The preamble, as amended, was agreed to.  The resolution, with its preamble, as amended, reads as follows:                              S. Res. 162       Whereas the well-being of all citizens of the United States      is preserved and enhanced as a direct result of the vigilance      and dedication of law enforcement personnel;       Whereas more than 900,000 men and women, at great risk to      their personal safety, presently serve their fellow citizens      as guardians of the peace;       Whereas peace officers are on the front lines in protecting      the schools and schoolchildren of the United States;       Whereas 147 peace officers across the United States were      killed in the line of duty during 2006, which is below the      decade-long annual average of 167 deaths;       Whereas a number of factors contributed to this reduction      in deaths, including--       (1) better equipment and increased use of bullet-resistant      vests;       (2) improved training;       (3) longer prison terms for violent offenders; and       (4) advanced emergency medical care;       Whereas every other day, 1 out of every 16 peace officers      is assaulted, 1 out of every 56 peace officers is injured,      and 1 out of every 5,500 peace officers is killed in the line      of duty somewhere in the United States; and       Whereas on May 15, 2007, more than 20,000 peace officers      are expected to gather in Washington, D.C., to join with the      families of their recently fallen comrades to honor those      comrades and all others who went before them: Now, therefore,      be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) recognizes May 15, 2007, as ``Peace Officers Memorial      Day'', in honor of the Federal, State, and local officers      that have been killed or disabled in the line of duty; and       (2) calls on the people of the United States to observe      that day with appropriate ceremonies and respect.                          ____________________
