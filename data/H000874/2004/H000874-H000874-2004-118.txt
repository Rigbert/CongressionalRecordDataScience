Speaker, does the gentleman have a view that if there was some disagreement and an agreement could not be reached on the other matters above and beyond the child tax credit, would the gentleman's expectation be that the child tax credit might be moved independently? Could the gentleman see a scenario that would result in that? I yield to my friend.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, that is speculation and I hate to speculate, but I know that this House has voted several times on these issues, and I know that the House wants to see a 10 percent tax bracket, the marriage penalty, and the child tax credit provisions to be extended and funded; and I would tend to think that the bill would have to come back with at least those provisions in it.
