Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Transportation and Infrastructure, Ways and Means, Resources, and Science be discharged from further consideration of the bill (H.R. 3332) to provide an extension of highway, highway safety, motor carrier safety, transit, and other programs funded out of the Highway Trust Fund pending enactment of a law reauthorizing the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
