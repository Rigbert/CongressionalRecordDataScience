 What we are seeking to do here is to raise combat pay, the imminent danger pay for those who are serving overseas. It will be raised from $150 a month to at least $250 a month, and to increase the family separation allowance from currently $100 a month to at least $250 a month.  Senator Warner was generous enough to talk about $3 billion here, which will accommodate the needs for the Guard and Reserve that Senator Landrieu has raised and also bring the combat pay and separation allowance figures up to where they should be. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
