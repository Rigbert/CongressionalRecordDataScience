 President, I am disappointed that Republicans refused to work with us to fully fund the President's emergency supplemental proposal, and it shouldn't have taken us so long to get to this point, but I am pleased that this will move us to a down payment on the President's emergency funding package through the Senate.  I want to commend Chairman Blunt for his work with us on this and all the Democrats and Republicans who are supporting it. But I want to remind all of us, this is only a first step, and we have to make sure that this agreement gets through the House and to the President's desk in the least amount of time.  I hope we can separate it from this bill and move it quickly. That was objected to yesterday over pay-fors, which are not part of this amendment, but this is a critical emergency. We need to move on this first step, and I hope we can do it in a timely manner.  I yield the floor.
