 President, I rise today to introduce legislation to address one of the critical security issues in the post 9/11 world: the existence of hundreds of vulnerable facilities around the world with nuclear materials. If keeping weapons of mass destruction, WMD, out of the hands of terrorists is at the top of our foreign policy agenda, then removing weapons-usable material from facilities where it is susceptible to terrorist theft or should diversion be a top priority for U.S. national security policy.  Yet, currently, there is no single, integrated U.S. government program, with a defined budget and resources, to facilitate the removal of these materials. The legislation I introduce today with Senators Bill Nelson, and Reed will: establish a presidential task force in the Department of Energy on nuclear removal; provide a specific mandate for a program to remove nuclear materials from vulnerable sites around the world as quickly as possible; provide specific direction to allow the use of flexible incentives, tailored to each site, to secure host-country cooperation in removing the nuclear materials, and; authorize $40 million in Fiscal Year 2005 to carry out the functions of this bill.  There are hundreds of facilities around the world that store from kilograms to tons of plutonium or highly enriched uranium, HEU. The State Department has identified 24 of these locations as high priority sites.  President Bush singled out terrorist nuclear attacks on the United States as the defining threat our nation will face in the future. In making the case against Saddam Hussein, he argued: ``If the Iraqi regime is able to produce, buy, or steal an amount of uranium a little bigger than a softball, it could have a nuclear weapon in less than a year.''  What he did not mention is that with the same amount of uranium, al Qaeda, Hezbollah, Hamas, or any terrorist organization could do the same and smuggle the weapon across U.S. borders. And the fact that AQ Khan's network put actual bomb designs on the black market only heightens the need to make sure the ingredients are not available.  In response to this threat, the Administration has focused its efforts on removing vulnerable international nuclear materials through four projects: the take-back to Russia of HEU fuels from Soviet-supplied reactors; the on-going effort to convert Soviet-designed research reactors from HEU to non-bomb-grade fuels; the decades-long effort to convert U.S.-supplied research reactors from HEU to LEU, and; the on-going effort to take back U.S.-supplied HEU.  This represents an important first step, but I am deeply concerned that these efforts are not sufficient and do not adequately address the seriousness of the issue.  The current approach will take 10-20 years to complete at the current rate of about 1 facility per year. This is a time frame out of synch with near-term dangers.  Under the current approach to the take-back of Soviet-supplied HEU, there have been only two successful HEU removals in more than two years, at Vinca and at Pitesti. But the Vinca operation also required the contribution of $5 million from the Nuclear Threat Initiative to complete, because of the administration's claim of inadequate authority to pursue various activities to facilitate Serbian cooperation.  The U.S.-Russian bilateral agreement on a broader take-back effort has taken years to complete--and even once final Russian government approval is secured, there are a wide range of other issues delaying progress within Russia, including the need to prepare environmental assessments of types that have never before been done in Russia, that will require sustained, high-level pressure to overcome.  U.S. efforts to convert HEU-fueled reactors within Russia are still moving slowly on the technical front, in part because of insufficient funding, and we are only now beginning to take the first steps toward providing incentives directly to facilities to give up their HEU.  The scope of the HEU conversion effort in Russia is inadequate. It covers only research reactors. Outside the scope of current efforts are critical assemblies, pulsed powered reactors, and civilian and military naval fuels. This leaves numerous vulnerable HEU stockpiles scattered across the FSU.  Under the current U.S. HEU take-back effort, the return of U.S.-origin HEU fuels, if no new incentives are offered, tons of U.S.-supplied HEU will remain abroad when the program is complete, this is DOE's official projection.  Under the current U.S. HEU reactor conversion effort, if no new incentives are offered, scores of U.S.-supplied reactors may continue to use HEU indefinitely.  A report released last year from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University described a scenario in which a 10 kiloton nuclear bomb is smuggled into Manhattan and detonated resulting in the loss of 500,000 people and causing $1 trillion in direct economic damage.  We must do everything in our power to prevent such an event from ever occurring.  We need a presidential task force in the Department of Energy on nuclear removal. We must provide a specific mandate for a program to remove nuclear materials from vulnerable sites around the world as quickly as possible and provide specific direction to allow the use of flexible incentives, tailored to each site, to secure host-country cooperation in removing the nuclear materials.  And, yes, we need additional funding to get the job done.  This legislation will give our government the direction, tools, and resources necessary to remove nuclear materials from vulnerable sites around the world in an expeditious manner. We have little time to spare. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2310       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. REMOVAL OF POTENTIAL NUCLEAR WEAPONS MATERIALS                    FROM VULNERABLE SITES WORLDWIDE.       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that      removing potential nuclear weapons materials from vulnerable      sites around the world would reduce the possibility that such      materials could fall into the hands of al Qaeda or other      groups and states hostile to the United States, and should be      a top priority for achieving the national security of the      United States.       (b) Task Force on Nuclear Material Removal.--(1) The      President shall establish in the Department of Energy a task      force to be known as the Task Force on Nuclear Material      Removal (in this section referred to as the ``Task Force'').       (2) The head of the Task Force shall be the Director of the      Task Force on Nuclear Material Removal, who shall be      appointed by the President for that purpose.       (3) The Director of the Task Force shall report directly to      the Deputy Administrator for Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation      of the National Nuclear Security Administration regarding the      activities of the Task Force under this section.       (4)(A) The Secretary of Energy, the Administrator for      Nuclear Security, and the Deputy Administrator for Defense      Nuclear Nonproliferation shall assign to the Task Force      personnel having such experience and expertise as is      necessary to permit the Task Force to carry out its mission      under this section.       (B) The Secretary of Energy and the Administrator for      Nuclear Security shall jointly consult with the Assistant to      the President for National Security Affairs, the Secretary of      State, the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Nuclear      Regulatory Commission, the heads of other appropriate      departments and agencies of the Federal Government, and      appropriate international organizations in order to identify      and establish mechanisms and procedures to ensure that the      Task Force is able to draw quickly on the capabilities of the      departments and agencies of the Federal Government and such      international organizations to carry out its mission under      this section.       (C) Mechanisms under subparagraph (B) may include the      assignment to the Task Force of personnel of the Department      of Energy and of other departments and agencies of the      Federal Government.       (5) The President may establish within the Executive Office      of the President a mechanism for coordinating the activities      of the Task Force under this section.       (c) Mission.--The mission of the Task Force shall be to      ensure that potential nuclear weapons materials are entirely      removed from the most vulnerable sites around the world as      soon as practicable after the date of the enactment of this      Act.       (d) Assistance.--To assist the Task Force in carrying out      its mission under this section, the Secretary of Energy may--       (1) provide funds to remove potential nuclear weapons      materials from vulnerable sites, including funds to cover the      costs of--       (A) transporting such materials from such sites to secure      facilities;       (B) providing interim security upgrades for such materials      pending their removal from their current sites;       (C) managing such materials after their arrival at secure      facilities;       (D) purchasing such materials;       (E) converting such sites to the use of low-enriched      uranium fuels;       (F) assisting in the closure and decommissioning of such      sites; and       (G) providing incentives to facilitate the removal of such      materials from vulnerable facilities;       (2) arrange for the shipment of potential nuclear weapons      materials to the United States, or to other countries willing      to accept such materials and able to provide high levels of      security for such materials, and dispose of such materials,      in order to ensure that United States national security      objectives are accomplished as quickly and effectively as      possible; and       (3) provide funds to upgrade security and accounting at      sites where, as determined by the Secretary, potential      nuclear weapons materials will remain for an extended period      in order to ensure that such materials are secure against      plausible potential threats, and will remain so in the      future.       (e) Report.--(1) Not later than 30 days after the submittal      to Congress of the budget of the President for fiscal year      2006 pursuant to section 1105(a) of title 31, United States      Code, the Secretary of Energy, in coordination with other      relevant Federal Government and international agencies, shall      submit to Congress a report that includes the following:       (A) A list of the sites determined by the Task Force to be      of the highest priorities for removal of potential nuclear      weapons materials, based on the quantity and attractiveness      of such materials at such sites and the risk of theft or      diversion of such materials for weapons purposes.       (B) An inventory of all sites worldwide where highly-     enriched uranium or separated plutonium is located,      including, to the extent practicable, a prioritized      assessment of the terrorism and proliferation risk posed by      such materials at each such site, based on the quantity of      such materials, the attractiveness of such materials for use      in nuclear weapons, the current level of security and      accounting for such materials, and the level of threat      (including the effects of terrorist or criminal activity and      the pay and morale of personnel and guards) in the country or      region where such sites are located.       (C) A strategic plan, including measurable milestones and      metrics, for accomplishing the mission of the Task Force      under this section.       (D) An estimate of the funds required to complete the      mission of the Task Force under this section, set forth by      year until anticipated completion of the mission.
