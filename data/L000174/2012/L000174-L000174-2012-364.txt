This is not a nomination that should have been filibustered or required the filing of a cloture motion in order to be scheduled for consideration by the Senate. This is a nomination, reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee over 5 months ago, that we should have voted on and confirmed last year.  Today's consideration was facilitated when the majority leader and the republican leader came to an understanding last week. With a judicial vacancies crisis that has lasted years, and nearly one in 10 judgeships across the Nation vacant, the Senate needs to work to reduce judicial vacancies significantly before the end of the year.  Unlike the nearly 60 district court nominees of President Bush who were confirmed within a week of being reported by the Judiciary Committee during President Bush's first term, qualified, consensus nominees to fill vacancies on our Federal courts have been needlessly stalled during President Obama's first term. The five-month delay in the consideration of Judge Nuffer is another example of the needless delays that were occasioned by Republicans' unwillingness to agree to schedule the nomination for a vote. The application of the ``new standard'' the junior Senator from Utah conceded Republicans are applying to President Obama's nominees continues to hurt the America people all over the country who are being forced to wait for judges to fill these important Federal trial court vacancies and hear their cases. Justice is being delayed for millions of Americans.  This nomination is one of the 20 circuit and district court nominations ready for Senate consideration and a final confirmation vote. They were all reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee after thorough review. All but a handful are by any measure consensus nominations, as is Judge Nuffer. There was never any good reason for the Senate not to proceed to votes on these nominations. It should not have taken cloture motions to get agreement to schedule votes on these qualified, consensus judicial nominations.  Judge Nuffer has been serving over the last 17 years as a magistrate judge for the very court to which he was nominated by the President. By any sensible standard he should be confirmed. No ``new standard'' should be used to oppose his confirmation. Like Judge Nuffer, the other nominees awaiting votes by the Senate are qualified judicial nominees. They are nominees whose judicial philosophy is well within the mainstream. These are all nominees supported by their home State Senators, both Republican and Democratic. The consequence of these months of delays is borne by the millions of Americans who live in districts and circuits with vacancies that could be filled as soon as Senate Republicans allow votes on the judicial nominations currently before the Senate awaiting their final consideration.  We must continue with the pattern set by last week's agreement. The Senate needs to make progress beyond the 14 nominations in that agreement and beyond the 20 nominations currently on the calendar. There are another eight judicial nominees who have had hearings and are working their way through the committee process. There was another needless delay when Republicans boycotted the Judiciary Committee meeting last week and prevented a quorum while insisting on a meeting to hold over nominees. We will overcome that and have those nominations before the Senate this spring.  I hope the committee will hold hearings on another 11 nominations in the next few weeks. One of those nominees, Robert Shelby, is to fill the other vacancy on the United States District Court for the District of Utah. Whether he is included depends in large measure on the Senators from Utah.  I have assiduously protected the rights of the minority in this process. I have only proceeded with judicial nominations supported by both home State Senators. That has meant that we are not able to proceed on current nominees from Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, Florida, Oklahoma and Utah. I even stopped proceedings on a circuit court nominee from Kansas when the Kansas Senators reversed themselves and withdrew their support for the nominee.  I have been discussing with the junior Senator from Utah whether he willsupport the nomination of Robert Shelby. I have yet to receive assurance that he will. His vote today on the Nuffer nomination may provide a clue.  When the Judiciary Committee considered the nomination of David Nuffer, both Republican home State Senators, Senator Hatch and Senator Lee, strongly supported the President's nomination. This is another nomination on which President Obama reached out and consulted with Republican home State Senators. The Senators from Utah supported this nomination when the President made it last year and when after hearing and study it was voted on by the Senate Judiciary Committee. They both serve on the Committee. Had either of them opposed this nomination, I would not have proceeded with it. They supported it. I hope this will not be another occasion on which either switches his vote from yes to no. That is another new practice and new standard that Senate Republicans have seemed to adopt.  By working steadily and by proceeding with the regular consideration of judicial nominations, I hope the Senate ensures that the Federal courts have the judges they need to provide justice for all Americans without needless delay. In the two most recent presidential election years, 2004 and 2008, we worked together to reduce judicial vacancies to the lowest levels in decades. In 1992, with a Republican President and a Democratic Senate majority, we confirmed 66 judicial nominees.  Our courts need qualified Federal judges, not vacancies, if they are to reduce the excessive wait times that burden litigants seeking their day in court. It is unacceptable for hardworking Americans who turn to their courts for justice to suffer unnecessary delays. When an injured plaintiff sues to help cover the cost of his or her medical expenses, that plaintiff should not have to wait 3 years before a judge hears the case. When two small business owners disagree over a contract, they should not have to wait years for a court to resolve their dispute.  I went back and checked my recollection of how we considered consensus Federal trial court nominees in President Bush's first term. Nearly 60 were confirmed within a week of being voted on by the Senate Judiciary Committee. By contrast there have only been two judicial nominees voted on so promptly since President Obama took office. I said at the time we were able to vote on the Alabama nominee supported by Senator Sessions, who was at that time the Committee's Ranking Republican member, and on Judge Reiss of Vermont, that I hoped they would become the model for regular order. Instead, they stand out as isolated exceptions to the months of delay Senate Republicans have insisted on before considering consensus Federal trial court nominees of this President. Today, the Senate will vote on the nominations of Ronnie Abrams and Rudolph Contreras to fill judicial vacancies in the U.S. District Courts for the Southern District of New York and the District of Columbia. These are both nominations that were reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee over 4 months ago. They are among the many nominations that could and should have been voted on and confirmed last year.  Today's votes are pursuant to the agreement reached by the majority leader and the Republican leader last week. Although I commend the step forward, the Senate must continue to vote on judicial nominations reported by the Judiciary Committee beyond the dozen encompassed by that agreement, if we are to make significant progress in reducing the vacancies across the Nation that number nearly one in 10.  Just yesterday, I read an article about the crushing caseload that the Federal courts in Arizona currently face. I will ask unanimous consent to include a copy of the article, entitled ``Federal courts in Arizona face crushing caseload,'' in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks. In the article, the chief judge of Arizona's Federal trial court noted that they are in ``dire circumstances'' and that they are ``under water'' from all the cases on their docket. The report notes that the Federal court not having its full complement of judges ``lessens the quality of justice for all parties involved.'' They are relying on visiting judges from other courts around the country to assist with their court proceedings. In too many places around the country, our Federal courts have to rely on senior judges. Their dedication is commendable but they should not be carrying such heavy workloads.  The needless 4-month delays in the consideration of Ronnie Abrams and Rudolph Contreras are just more examples of the delays that have been occasioned by Republicans' unwillingness to agree to schedule the nominations for a vote. The Senate must return to the practice of moving forward on consensus nominees and of ``build[ing] bridges instead of burn[ing] them,'' as Senator Coburn urged.  The nominations today are two of the 20 circuit and district court nominations ready for Senate consideration and a final confirmation vote. They were all reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee after thorough review. All but a handful are by any measure consensus nominations, as are Ms. Abrams and Mr. Contreras. There was never any good reason for the Senate not to proceed to votes on these nominations. It should not have taken cloture petitions to secure agreement to schedule votes on these qualified, consensus judicial nominations.  Ronnie Abrams is nominated to serve as a Federal trial judge on the Southern District of New York. She is an experienced attorney who spent 10 years as a Federal prosecutor in the district to which she has been nominated. She served as Chief of the General Crimes Unit and Deputy Chief of the Criminal Division. Since 2008, Ms. Abrams has worked as Special Counsel for Pro Bono at the New York law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, where she began her legal career after clerking for Chief Judge Thomas Griesa in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.  Rudolph Contreras is nominated to serve as a Federal trial judge in the District of Columbia. Born to Cuban immigrants, Mr. Contreras has devoted his career to public service for the last 17 years. He worked as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the District of Columbia and in Delaware. He has risen to be the chief of the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, where he currently serves. The delay in considering his nomination recalls the 4-month filibuster against the nomination of Judge Adalberto Jordan of Florida. On that nomination, Senate Republicans delayed the vote for another 2 days after cloture was invoked and the filibuster brought to an end. Judge Jordan was then finally confirmed as the first Cuban-American to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.  The consequences of these months of delays are borne by the nearly 160 million Americans who live in districts and circuits with vacancies that could be filled as soon as Senate Republicans agree to up or down votes on the 20 judicial nominations currently before the Senate awaiting a confirmation vote.  The Senate must continue the actions allowed by last week's agreement. The Senate needs to make progress beyond the nominations included in that agreement, and beyond the 20 nominations currently on the calendar. There are another eight judicial nominees who have had hearings and are working their way through the Committee process. Several of those were needlessly delayed last week when Republicans boycotted the Judiciary Committee meeting and prevented a quorum after insisting on a meeting only to hold over nominees. There are another 11 nominations on which the Committee should be holding additional hearings during the next several weeks. By working steadily and by continuing the regular consideration of judicial nominations represented by last week's understanding between the leaders, the Senate can do its part to ensure that the Federal courts have the judges they need to provide justice for all Americans without needless delay.  Our courts need qualified Federal judges, not vacancies, if they are to reduce the excessive wait times that burden litigants seeking their day in court. It is unacceptable for hardworking Americans who turn to their courts for justice to suffer unnecessary delays. When an injured plaintiff sues to help cover the cost of his or her medical expenses, that plaintiff should not have to wait 3 years before a judgehears the case. When two small business owners disagree over a contract, they should not have to wait years for a court to resolve their dispute.  Today's votes are steps in the right direction.  I ask unanimous consent that the article I referenced be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From YumaSun.com, Mar. 17, 2012]            Federal Courts in Arizona Face Crushing Caseload                          (By Victoria Pelham)       Federal courts in Arizona are still in ``dire      circumstances'' as an emergency declaration that was supposed      to help judges keep pace with a crushing caseload is set to      expire.       The judicial emergency declared last year in the wake of      the shooting death of Chief Judge John Roll runs out Monday,      but officials say the U.S. District Court for the state still      faces many of the same challenges.       ``The reason that existed last year still prevails this      year,'' Chief Judge Roslyn Silver said recently. ``We are      still in dire circumstances. We are under water.''       The judicial emergency more than doubled the time allowed      for the government to bring a case to trial, giving the court      some relief from a rising caseload and judicial vacancies in      the district.       Through ``lots of hard work'' and the help of visiting      judges, the district court has managed to stay within the      original 70-day time frame for cases to come to trial under      the Speedy Trial Act and has not had to invoke the 180-day      limit allowed under the emergency.       But that balancing act could be thrown off, Silver said,      without the extra help the court has been receiving.       ``If we don't have that, which is the fail-safe, then we're      in big trouble, because there's just no way we could handle      this caseload,'' Silver said.       Arizona had the highest number of per-judge felony filings      in the nation in fiscal 2011, at 554 criminal felony filings      for each district court judge, according to the U.S. District      Court Judicial Caseload Profile for Arizona. That load was      fueled in part by the large number of immigration cases      handled in the court, experts said.       The court also saw the total number of cases per judge grow      by 22 percent in the fiscal year, from 793 to 969, the      fourth-highest judicial caseload in the country, the report      said.       It came as three of the 13 district judgeships allotted to      the state were vacant. Two were empty last January when Roll      was killed in the shooting spree at a Tucson supermarket that      killed five others and wounded 13, including former Rep.      Gabrielle Giffords.       The judicial emergency was declared by Silver after Roll's      death. It was extended last February to this March by the      Judicial Council of the Ninth Circuit, in an effort to buy      the district some breathing room.       President Barack Obama nominated two candidates in June to      fill the vacancies, but only one, Judge Jennifer Guerin      Zipps, has been appointed. The other nominee, attorney      Rosemary Marquez, has been stalled in the Senate.       Brian Karth, the clerk for the district, said filling those      vacancies is the minimum needed. He claimed that, according      to judicial standards, the district's caseload is high enough      to warrant 10 additional judgeships.       In the meantime, the district has had to rely on visiting      judges from other districts across the country, Karth said.      One to two judges come each week to assist with court      proceedings.       ``We continue to struggle to keep within standards, and      everybody's basically forced to work harder and try to be      resourceful in pulling together resources, sometimes from      outside our district, to perform well,'' Karth said.       ``There's certainly a wear and tear on anybody who has to      sustain that sort of a pace for lengthy periods,'' he said.       Walter Nash, a trial lawyer and partner with Nash &      Kirchner in Tucson, said the ``crushing'' caseload in the      district is having a serious impact on trials.       ``It lessens the quality of justice for all parties      involved,'' Nash said.       Prosecutors have less time to prepare arguments, while      victims' cases aren't resolved ``as fast as they should be.''      And judges could be rushed into a decision, meaning some      guilty defendants may be acquitted, he said.       The need for new judges will be even greater when Speedy      Trial Act provisions are reinstated next week after the      emergency expires, Nash said.       ``You get the best result . . . if everyone has time to      handle a case properly,'' Nash said.       Silver agreed that slow trials affect all sectors of the      public and courts have an ``obligation to ensure justice for      all.'' But with limited resources, space problems in      courtrooms, large numbers of criminal cases and other      concerns, trials could suffer, with civil trials in      particular lagging behind or not getting the attention they      deserve.       ``So far we're OK, but it will present a problem at some      time,'' Silver said. ``We are required to act fairly in every      criminal case, but there's only so much we can do.''       The emergency cannot be renewed for six months after it      expires. Silver said that if things don't improve, officials      will have to consider the possibility of renewing.       ``There was a reason for it last year, and I expect      there'll be a reason for it this year,'' she said.
