 President, once again, this is related to campaign spending. It does not belong in this bill. We are trying to keep a bill with which the greatest majority of the Senate can agree.  Secondly, I know of no problems related to this issue in this body. Should there be any evidence that any Senator has that there are problems, please bring it to the Rules Committee and we will do something about it.  In the absence of that, I move to table the Vitter amendment No. 6, and I ask for the yeas and nays?
