I took a position. I waited 4 days to take a position against the particular approach that the Secretary of the Treasury is recommending, and I did so because I wanted to wait until I understood as much of it as I could.  One of the biggest problems I saw is that, first, the magnitude of $700 billion is awfully hard to get your arms around; secondly, who would make the determination as to which institutions we would be approaching, and within those institutions which assets, and how do you qualify those assets. Then I found out it would be asset managers. Now, would that be 500 asset managers, 5,000? Maybe it will be some of these same people who created the problem in the first place.  These are questions that I know people who have their hearts in the right place are trying to address. And I agree there is a problem looming out there and we need to correct it, but I am not in any hurry to correct it by doing the wrong thing. It is too big a problem.
