 Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Postal Employees Safety Enhancement Act and in support of safe workplaces across our nation.  This important legislation extends the ability of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to regulate the U.S. Postal Service as it would for any private business. This is welcome legislation for the over 2,000 postal employees in the State of Vermont, and the hundreds of thousands in the country.  This bill is supported by the American Postal Workers Union, the National Association of Lettercarriers, the Mailhanders (Laborers International), and the Rural Lettercarriers Association--every union that represents our postal employees. We should listen to our postal workers who desire the full protection of OSHA.  Mr. Speaker, OHSA is a vital piece of our social contract. It was passed in response to unsafe working conditions that were found throughout the United States, and it has prevented countless injuries and fatalities on the job. Now, 27 years after the passage of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, we should continue our commitment that every worker in America has the right to a safe workplace.  What we have before us today is legislation that says to many of the federal government's most valued employees--those who process and deliver the mail and keep our country on the move: We honor your work and we will protect you from workplace hazards.  Mr. Speaker, every American deserves the full benefits of an OSHA compliant workplace. I urge strong support for our nation's hard working postal employees. Pass this legislation for them, for the people who love them, and for the country that employs them.                          ____________________
