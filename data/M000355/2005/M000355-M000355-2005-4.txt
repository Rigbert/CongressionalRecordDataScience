 President, I have a series of judicial nominations that have been cleared on both sides. I ask unanimous consent the Senate immediately proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations on today's Executive Calendar: Nos. 457, 458, 459, 460, 461, 462, 463, 471, and 472. I further ask unanimous consent that the nominations be confirmed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then return to legislative session.
