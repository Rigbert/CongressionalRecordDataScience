  First of all, I want to acknowledge the work of the distinguished senior Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, in bringing to my attention--and also to Senator Lautenberg's attention--the needs of his State in dealing with this economic development project.  I did have the opportunity, at Senator Chafee's request, to meet with Senator Chafee, the Governor, and the junior Senator, Senator Reed, regarding this project. I also met with Senator Chafee on numerous occasions as we talked about, ``Would funding for this project be included in the bill?'' I assured him that it would, and for a good reason.  This is a sound project for the people of Rhode Island. We investigated it onthe committee and found that it makes a lot of sense. And as Senator Chafee has pointed out, the people of Rhode Island are also putting up a lot of money through a bond issue of $50 million. And $50 million is a lot of money for a State of around 1 million. And I want to acknowledge his work in this regard and say that we are pleased that we have been successful in identifying resources for this project. And I believe it is going to be very, very positive for the State of Rhode Island.  I look forward to working with the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island in the future.
