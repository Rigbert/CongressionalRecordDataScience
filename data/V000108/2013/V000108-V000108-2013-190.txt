Speaker, it is with great respect that I rise to celebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month and its 2013 theme, Hispanics: Serving and Leading Our Nation with Pride and Honor. From September 15, 2013, through October 15, 2013, the people of the United States will once again celebrate the history, culture, and tradition of our Hispanic American brothers and sisters.   Hispanic Heritage Month begins each year on September 15th, the anniversary of the independence of five Latin American countries: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. Mexico and Chile celebrate their independence days on September 16th and September 18th, respectively. Since its inception as National Hispanic Heritage Week in 1968, which later became National Hispanic Heritage Month in 1988, Americans have taken this time to not only honor the rich culture and tradition of Hispanic Americans, but also to reflect on the countless contributions they have made to their communities and to America.   Throughout America's history, people of Hispanic descent have played a major role in the development and progress of our nation. National Hispanic Heritage Month also celebrates the many Hispanic leaders and members of our communities who have added to the prosperity of the United States in every facet of society, including medicine, business, arts and entertainment, sports, education, politics, and the military.   America's success is dependent upon the rich heritage and cultural diversity of our people. I rise today to pay tribute to the countless Hispanic Americans who have made America a better place to live. For their contributions, they are worthy of our highest praise.   Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in recognizing National Hispanic Heritage Month. The Hispanic community has played an important role in enriching the quality of life and culture of Northwest Indiana and the United States. Let us commend our Hispanic brothers and sisters who have contributed so much to the improvement of our communities and who have helped shape our great nation.                          ____________________
