 Nissen's letter of support, I also received a letter from Dr. Curt Furberg, professor of public health science atWake Forest University School of Medicine. Dr. Furberg is not only a professor of medicine, but he is also a member of the Food and Drug Administration Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee.  Dr. Furberg knows the FDA from the inside, and you might say he knows it inside-outside, in and out. In fact, even Dr. Furberg has written me to say he is supportive of creating a new center, and he is particularly supportive of creating a new enforcement tool to be used against bad players in the drug industry.  I also have that letter and would ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the Record as well.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      Wake Forest,                                           School of Medicine,                                                   March 15, 2007.     Hon. Chuck Grassley,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: I am pleased that members of the      U.S. Congress are taking constructive actions to address the      major problems with drug safety. Your Bills--FDASA and the      FACT Act--are excellent and, if passed, would greatly benefit      the U.S. public.       My major concern relates to the FDA's lack of enforcement      tools. Regulations and commitments of any kind have limited      value if major and repeated violations involve no      consequences. Drugmakers who suppress or delay submission of      safety information to the FDA, stall label changes      (especially new Black Box warnings) or fail to honor their      commitments to complete post-market safety studies are rarely      (if ever) penalized for their unacceptable behaviors. Thus, I      particularly applaud the way your FDASA Bill would give the      Director of the Center for Postmarket Evaluation and Research      for Drugs and Biologics wide-ranging authority to take      corrective action.       If I can be of any assistance in facilitating passage of      this legislation, do not hesitate to call me.           Respectfully,     Curt D. Furberg, MD, PhD,       Professor of Public Health Sciences, Member of the FDA Drug      Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee.
