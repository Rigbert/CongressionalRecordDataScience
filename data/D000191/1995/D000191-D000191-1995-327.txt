Speaker, many seem to think that the $40 billion bailout of Mexico has gone from the business page to the obituary page. If only that were true. We need very much to be on our guard and watch out.  As I speak here on the floor, all across this Capitol and around Washington backroom deals are being cut to put American taxpayers on the line to bail out investment houses on Wall Street, banks, and other speculators that were very lucratively involved in the Mexican market. They were getting 20 percent and more interest.  Don't you think maybe if someone is paying you 20 percent interest or 25 or 30 percent interest, there is a little bit of risk that flows with that investment? Wall Street doesn't think so, nor do other speculators. They think the American taxpayers should bail them out.  Of course, they are not going to give us any of the 20 or 25 percent interest that they collected, thank you very much. They want it all.  Whose money is at risk? Whose money is at risk? A very, very senior administration official yesterday, in a closed door meeting of the Democratic [[Page H454]] Caucus, laughably tried to tell us that it was middle-income people's money at risk. Their pension funds are invested in Mexico, he said.  Pension funds? Any pension administrator who is investing in junk bonds in Mexico--and that is what these things are, junk bonds that pay 20 to 40 percent interest, from a country that defaulted on all of its loans just 12 years ago, no one thinks they are a good risk. Any pension administrator who has any substantial amount of money down there, there is a cause of action against him by the holders of that pension fund. I don't believe that is true.  If it is true, let's disclose it. We have sent a letter to the Secretary of the Treasury asking ``Whose money is at risk here? Who are we bailing out?'' There has been no response.  I don't know that we will ever know who we are bailing out, because apparently no hearings will ever be held on this bailout legislation. The largest bailout since the savings and loan crisis, and no hearings are to be allowed.  Mr. Speaker, I have heard my Republican colleagues around here chortling a little bit because Bill Clinton is so closely identified with this issue. At least, although I disagree with him, President Clinton has the guts to go out and say he thinks this needs to be done.  However, remember, the Republicans have an absolute stranglehold on both the House and Senate. Any bill that moves through here has to have their permission, has to have their votes. It is not a Democratic Congress or a Democratic Senate, so they do not want to hold hearings.  No, they do not want to hold hearings. They do not want to be identified with it. They do not want people to really know what is going on. They do not want possibly to upset some of those people on Wall Street who so handsomely provided for their elections.  It is business as usual here in Washington, DC, folks, despite all the hoopla about the contract, despite all the hoopla about the new majority, business as usual, back room deals, $40 billion, U.S. taxpayers on the line, and no hearings. That is even worse than the worst abuse I can think of of my own party in the last Congress.  Now we have even drug in the book deal. Today or yesterday the chairman of the House Committee on Banking and Financial Services, the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Leach], sent a note to White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta tying Republican support of the Mexican $40 billion bailout to the need to get guarantees, guarantees, of kinder treatment by Democrats of House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia, so there you have it, folks. If you think this isn't business as usual, in fact it is even worse than business as usual, a $40 billion bailout, for whom, putting the American taxpayers on the line, and the Republican-controlled Congress is going to refuse to hold a single hearing on this, and will try and jam this thing through in the dark of the night some night next week or the week after.                          ____________________
