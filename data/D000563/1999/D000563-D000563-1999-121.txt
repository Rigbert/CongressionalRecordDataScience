I gave an example of a baby inside a mother's womb with its brain outside of its skull. This brain was growing in size. It was very clear that the baby was alive through the mother that continued to detect a fetal heart beat, and there is an obvious question as to whether this baby could ever survive. At the moment, they had to make a decision. They knew if they went through certain procedures, the mother could have her uterus rupture because of the size of this abnormal growth of the baby, and they decided to use the procedure that the Senator would ban.  Now, conceding everything you have said, does the Senator from Pennsylvania not acknowledge the fact that the baby's life was something that, frankly, was not going to last but a few seconds? As soon as that baby was disconnected from the mother's umbilical cord, the placenta, that baby was not going to survive at that point. The doctor had to say: This baby is not going to live and if I don't use the procedure that you are going to ban here, I can do damage to this woman where she would never have another baby. That is the kind of case. I understand the Senator says it is a living thing, but it is living because of the mother's body and it cannot live on its own.
