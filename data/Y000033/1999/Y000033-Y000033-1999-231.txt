Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure today to introduce the Arctic Coastal Plain Domestic Energy Security Act of 1999.  This bill has three fundamental purposes: creating new jobs for Americans, sustaining and continuing economic growth, and strengthening national security.  The Act accomplishes these purposes through directing the environmentally sound leasing of the 1002 oil reserve area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refugee (ANWR) to oil and gas exploration and development. The 1002 oil reserve comprises most of the 1.5 million-acre coastal plain of the 19.6 million-acre ANWR, and is named after the section of the Alaska Lands Act that specifically set the region aside for study and consideration of developing its giant energy potential. Experts believe this area holds America's largest untapped energy resource.  ANWR is enormous in size, the size of South Carolina. Almost one-half is already designated wilderness. Congress considered making the 1002 area wilderness, but rejected it in favor of studying its energy potential to meet future domestic needs. The Reagan Administration endorsed legislation to authorize leasing because the relatively light footprint occupied by development is so negligibly tiny in comparison to the great benefits oil development brings. Put into perspective, opening the 1002 oil reserve would take up less space than a single airport within an area the size of South Carolina.  With national production declines occurring and world production nearing its peak, the legislation is urgently needed. Because at least 10 years of environmental planning, study, and review are necessary to carry out a responsible development plan in the 1002 oil reserve, opening the area now would assure state, federal, local, and industry planners enough time to implement necessary safety and environmental measures. If Congress waits for an oil crisis to occur before recognizing that opening ANWR is necessary, rest assured that in the haste to get the oil, most careful environmental planning will go by the way-side. Opening the area now assures that we can take all 10 years--or more if necessary--of anticipated lead time to move cautiously and responsibly.  The most important benefit of opening the 1002 oil reserve is job creation. Up to 735,000 jobs, many of which are union jobs, could be created throughout all 50 states if a large oil and gas reserve is indeed confirmed and developed. Jobs in the oil industry are among the highest-paying private sector jobs available, but they will be lost if new development and opportunity is not created through a wise-use policy for America's public lands.  As hard as it is to believe, there are some who don't think the escalation of oil imports and correlative decline in domestic production is cause for concern. This has manifested itself in a Clinton-Gore Administration policy to discourage new development of resources on public lands.  Unfortunately, the result is a future of ever more dependence on foreign sources of oil and record trade deficits. In fact, the rate of imports has grown from 36% at the time of the energy crisis of the 1970's to 56% today * * * and it is growing rapidly. Excessive reliance on foreign supplies coupled with the paucity of new domestic energy development gives other nations opportunities to unduly influence our economic and foreign policy.  While working Americans understand the importance of oil, they also place high value on the environment. This Act reflects these priorities by balancing resource development with stipulations and conditions that effectively require the environmental standards of North Slope development to match or exceed those of any country upon which we rely for our imports. Such is already the case in Prudhoe Bay, America's largest oil field, where the factual record shows that resource development--when done right--is consistent with conservation of the environment. Alaska's arctic has accounted for one-quarter of the United States' oil production in over twenty years, yet biologists cannot identify any declines in wildlife attributable to the Arctic oil activity. None. In fact, Caribou even outnumber the entire population of Alaskans. This is no mere coincidence, but the result of careful planning and regulations that recognize development and environmental protection are compatible.  But don't take my word for it. Listen to the Inupiat Eskimos--the first environmentalists. They support this legislation. They understand that with careful planning and regulation using the most advanced technology available, oil development is compatible with the conservation of wildlife, habitat, and their Arctic environment.                          ____________________
