Chairman, we are getting a little afield here. This is not about reinstating the draft. We are not about that. The military does not want it. In fact, the Department of Defense has said peacetime draft registration, not conscription, could be suspended with no effect on military mobilization requirements.  Ronald Reagan said, ``I believe this proposal, draft registration, is an ill-conceived one and should be rejected. Advance registration will do little to enhance our military preparedness.'' That was from Ronald Reagan and the Department of Defense.  If this is what we think brings patriotism and citizenship to our kids, not good schools, not decent housing, and all the other things we are eliminating here on the floor, this is an opportunity to eliminate an obsolete Federal bureaucracy and put in place a standby system which uses modern computer technology, if indeed a calamity ever comes, and if indeed we ever have to go back to conscription, which I do not believe we will, but we will have that as a standby system.  This is 1940's technology. This is not citizenship, except in some bizarre Publisher's Clearinghouse view of the world where you send in a postcard every time you move. That is not teaching our young people the values that we need to instill.
