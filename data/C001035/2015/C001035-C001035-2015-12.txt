President, this amendment, which I offer with my colleagues Senator Murkowski and Senator Kirk, would strike the provisions that would eliminate Federal funding, including Medicaid reimbursements, for Planned Parenthood. Otherwise, the likely result would be the closure of several hundred clinics across the country, depriving millions of women of the health care provider of their choice.  I want to make clear that our amendment does not include any new spending, it does not increase taxes, and it retains the current Hyde amendment language, which prohibits the use of Federal funds for abortions except in cases of rape, incest or where the life of the mother is at risk.  I urge adoption of the amendment.
