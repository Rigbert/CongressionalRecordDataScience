President, I, too, wish to join Senator Chafee in paying tribute to the Very Reverend Abdulahad Gabriel Doumato on the occasion of his fiftieth anniversary as leader of the parish of Saint Ephraim's Syrian Orthodox Church in Rhode Island.  A proud and patriotic ``American'', Father Doumato loves his adopted country and is happiest when helping the new immigrants within his flock assimilate into American society. Mr. President, Father Doumato is responsible for sponsoring hundreds of new citizens to our great nation, granting them the opportunity to live the American dream. He has educated these families--including those of six of his brothers and sisters--about our system of government and the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility of American citizenship.  Father Doumato is often heard telling his parishioners, ``There is no country like the United States. It truly is the land of opportunity and you should thank God for the opportunity you have to live in this great land.'' A good shepherd, Father Doumato has been a shining example to his family and his flock.  The Doumatos are a sizable and considerable clan in Rhode Island--the extended family numbers over 120 persons. We cannot imagine that there has been a single elected official in the Blackstone Valley area, or across the State, that has not come into contact with a member of the family. Indeed, father Doumato's children, grandchildren, nephews and nieces have been industrious citizens and have served our country in numerous positions of distinction, including as officers in the Armed Forces, diplomats, university educators, U.S. Senate aides and senior advisors, engineers, and leaders in law, the arts, medicine, commerce and industry. He and his family have richly contributed to the betterment of our community in Rhode Island.  Mr. President, in closing, I would also like to wish Reverend Doumato and his wife, Victoria, a happy and healthy 57th Anniversary, which they will celebrate later this year.  May his children and grandchildren--along with his parishioners--continue to benefit from his wisdom!                          ____________________
