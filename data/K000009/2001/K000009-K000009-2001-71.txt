Speaker, every time that I have the privilege of addressing this House, I am reminded of indeed what a privilege it is to represent constituents from my own State of Ohio and to vote on laws affecting our Nation and the world.  This week in particular the magnitude of this privilege has come home to me again. I rise as a free citizen in the freest Nation on Earth, given the opportunity under our freedom of speech to speak my peace, but in a representative government.  As I think about what happened to America this week, I think about the forces of the world that are outside of governments and have no representative decision-making in the way that the civilized world understands. I am reminded of what happens to the world when that kind of force is allowed to work its evil in our country and other places.  As Members of Congress, we are given the privilege of traveling to many places. A few years ago, I remember going to one of the newly emerging nations of the world. During a session with the citizenry, I was asked, ``Congresswoman Kaptur, what makes you feel like a nation?'' And I remember stepping back from the microphone for a moment and pondering that, and trying to answer the question that I was asked, why do your people feel like a nation?  This week, we have had many indicators of how deep our nationhood runs: the enormity of the valor that we have seen coast-to-coast, the thousands of acts of kindness and of decency that have accompanied this great tragedy that our entire Nation has suffered, and so many families have suffered so personally.  This morning as we sat at the prayer service and then stood for the posting of our colors, and I looked at all the battle-flag ribbons that walked into the church, and I thought about all the blood that had been shed, all the families, including ours, that had been affected by prior wars and prior engagements, I thought about the red in our flag, and I thought about the enormity of sacrifice that has maintained this Republic over our existence.  So many Americans have been writing me, my own constituents and others. We have been receiving letters from all over the world yesterday. I wish to enter into the record a letter of condolence and support from the Nation of Ukraine through the Ambassador from Ukraine.  I hope the American people, through us, can understand the weight of public opinion and the weight of support that is on the side of justice as we move forward and try to eliminate and bring to justice those who would have caused such horror on our shores.  I had one senior citizen who wrote me: ``Congresswoman Kaptur, I am elderly, I am disabled. I am too weak, I cannot give blood. What can I do?'' I wrote her back, ``You certainly can put a little flag in your front window.'' I am sure she does not have much money, but I suggested she might make a small donation to the scholarship fund that the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon) have put in the form of a bill for all the families in New York and Pennsylvania, other places in our country, and Virginia, that have been affected, for their children.  I was thinking, during World War II, we had a massive savings bond campaign. I think every American can buy a savings bond. Every American can strengthen our country even more in meeting what lies ahead. So I would urge the President, in the additional funds the Congress has appropriated, to consider expanding some of the savings bond operations across this country; to work with our banks, our private institutions, the Internet, and allow the American people, at whatever level of support they might be able to give, to strengthen our Nation as we seek to meet the enemy.  Let me also say that I would encourage many of our young people as they are considering their futures to think about enlistment in our Armed Forces, in our Reserves, in our guard forces across this country. Each of us in our own hearts, I know the Members of Congress, we know we are soldiers of freedom, too. We ask the American people to lend the kind of support that we will need to carry out the activities of a free people under a representative government.                              {time}  1500  I ask people to consider joining our intelligence services.  And, finally, let me say to the American people and to our youth in particular, study in your classes the roots of rage and the roots of those who would seek to harm the harbingers offreedom not just here at home but abroad. Take the time to learn America, indeed, will surmount this latest crisis.                          ____________________
