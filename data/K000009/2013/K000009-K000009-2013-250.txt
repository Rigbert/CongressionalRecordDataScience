Speaker, I rise in order to recognize Mr. William G. Zurkey who has recently retired after thirty-six years as a music teacher, the last twenty-six which have been at Avon Lake High School in Avon Lake, Ohio. Having spent his career in education and inspiring our youth, I am beyond privileged to celebrate his career.  William Zurkey holds a bachelor of Music Education from Bowling Green State University, a Master's degree in Music from Cleveland State University, and has completed course work in his doctoral studies at Kent State University. His impressive academic resume is indicative of the immense skill and dedication William brought to his job.  The communities of Avon Lake, Ohio and Cleveland, Ohio know William for being a superior director and musical mind. Over the years, his high school chorales have received numerous awards, garnered state-wide, national and international recognition, and have been invited to perform at Carnegie Hall in New York City three times. In addition to his high school duties, William has served as an adjunct Faculty of Music Education at the Oberlin College Conservatory of Music in Oberlin, Ohio where he directed the Women's Chorale. He has also worked with chorales at the Baldwin-Wallace College Conservatory of Music in Berea, Ohio.  William's passions for music and mentoring community youth led to involvements outside of the classroom as well. He coached football at multiple levels, most recently as the head coach of the 8th Grade team at Avon Lake. Last year, William was hired to create and direct the Cleveland Pops Orchestra Chorus, which performs four times per year.  William has excelled in his career, having received widespread adulation. This past spring, his alma mater Bowling Green State University recognized him as an outstanding, notable and accomplished alumnus. He has been the president of the Ohio Choral Directors Association and has served on the American Choral Directors Association's Central Division Board. Finally, William has been named multiple times in Who's Who Among America's Teachers, a list of student-nominated educators that have been inspiration and influential in their students' lives.  I am delighted to submit a record of William's service and accomplishments. I thank him for his career-long commitment to the utmost important task of educating our younger generations: I thank him for his constant and masterful development of the arts. And I wish him only happiness as he enjoys retirement, spending time with his wife and their children, staying involved with the Bay United Methodist Church in Bay Village, Ohio, and his continued community and musical endeavors.                          ____________________
