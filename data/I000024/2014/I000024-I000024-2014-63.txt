``Trinity'' Adkinson III. Sergeant Adkinson and three other soldiers died August 31, 2010, when an improvised explosive device blew up next to their vehicle near Forward Operating Base Shank, Logar province, Afghanistan.  Known by family and friends as ``Trinity'' because he was the third Vinson in his family, he was born on December 13, 1983, and grew up in Empire City, OK, before moving in his junior year of high school to live with an aunt in Kansas. His father recalled interest in the Armed Forces was stoked early for Trinity as the first toys his son played with were G.I. Joes.  ``He played army outside, he trick or treated as an armyman,'' Adkinson Jr. said. ``Me and him spent a lot of time outside in the woods. He was born to be a soldier.'' Trinity enlisted in the Army immediately after graduating from Chaparral High School in Harper, KS, in 2003.  He started his career with the 82nd Airborne Division followed by serving with the Honor Guard of the 4th Infantry Division. Later assigned to the 173rd Brigade Support Battalion, 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team based in Bamberg, Germany, Trinity served three tours in Iraq and was on his second tour in Afghanistan.  ``I begged him not to go back,'' said grandmother Mary Adkinson after seeing her grandson earlier this year. She said he told her he needed to return to Afghanistan so that the people of that nation could have peace in their lives.  He was preceded in death by his grandfathers, Vinson Bryon Adkinson, Sr., and Robert Allen Morgan, Sr., and is survived by his wife Veronica, father Vinson Bryon Adkinson, Jr., of Comanche, OK, brother Jacob Aaron Adkinson of Stillwater, OK, sisterMary Kay Adkinson of Wichita, KS, his paternal grandmother Mary Ellen Adkinson of Duncan, OK, and maternal grandmother Sharon Kay Morgan of Wichita, KS.  SGT David Shearouse served with Trinity and was given the task of escorting his remains home. ``He always wanted to take point, he wanted to be the leader,'' he said of his fallen comrade. ``Everybody wanted to be like him. He was a good man. I lost my friend, my brother and my hero.''  The family held a funeral service for Sergeant Adkinson on September 13, 2010, and he was laid to rest with full military honors in Fort Sill National Cemetery in Elgin, OK.  Today we remember Army SGT Vinson B. Adkinson III, a young man who loved his family and country and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                      Sergeant Jason L. McCluskey  Madam President, I would also like to pay tribute to SGT Jason L. McCluskey. Jason was tragically killed in action on November 4, 2010, of wounds suffered when insurgents attacked his unit with small-arms fire in Zarghun Shahr, Mohammad Agha district of Afghanistan.  Jason was born September 12, 1984, to Jimmy and Delores ``Darby'' McCluskey in Stockton, CA, and later moved to McAlester, OK. As a wrestler at McAlester High School he went to the State championship tournament several times before graduating in 2004. Quoting James Dean in his senior quote, he wrote: ``Dream as if you will live forever. And live as if you will die today.''  Upon enlisting in the Army in April 2006, he was assigned as a paratrooper to the 27th Engineer Battalion, 20th Engineer Brigade, XVIII Airborne Corps, Fort Bragg, NC. ``SGT McCluskey was a true hero to us all,'' said 1SG Randolph Delapena, his company first sergeant. ``He was like my son that I saw come up the ranks to become an elite non-commissioned officer. He was the edge of the sword, he led from the front, and he cared deep down for not only his Soldiers, but every Soldier he came in contact with.''  His mother, Delores Oliveras, said shortly after her son's death that Jason was dedicated to serving in the Army. ``I asked him plenty of times to leave the Army,'' she said. ``But all he would say was, `No, Mom, I really love what I do.' '' Shortly before his death, he was named his battalion's Noncommissioned Officer of the Year.  McCluskey is survived by his son Landon McCluskey, mother Delores Darby McCluskey Oliveras and her husband Ray, father Jimmy McCluskey, brother Joshua Stambaugh, stepfather Charlie Stambaugh, grandmother Anita McCluskey, grandmother Wilma Kohl and her husband Doyle, mother of his son, Cassie Wright, and many aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces and nephews, as well as many other relatives, friends, and loved ones too numerous to mention.  A funeral was held on November 12, 2010, at Chaney Harkins Funeral Home, and he was laid to rest in Tannehill Cemetery in McAlester, OK.  ``Our Army and nation will be forever indebted to SGT McCluskey for his service,'' said Major General Rodney O. Anderson from Fort Bragg. ``SGT McCluskey laid down his life for his friends, his battle buddies, his unit, our Army and our nation.''  Today we remember Army SGT Jason L. McCluskey, a young man who loved his family and country and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                       Captain David J.
