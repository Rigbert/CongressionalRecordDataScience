President, this year marks the 100th anniversary of one of Vermont's most nationally recognized businesses, Agri-Mark Cabot Creamery Co-operative. Founded as a small butter plant in Cabot, VT, with principles of producing high-quality dairy products and supporting farmers and communities, Cabot has grown to be a leader in the dairy industry, raising the bar for excellence across the country. The founders of Cabot prided themselves on quality products and doing things the right way. Cabot began with just 94 members that collectively owned 800 cows. Today, Cabot has expanded to include over 800 farm families, never losing sight of their core values of exceptional quality, safety, and community cooperation. These tenants have been upheld by their members repeatedly throughout the last century.  The farm families of Cabot Creamery Co-operative continue to be innovators, pioneers of sustainability, and dedicated stewards to their land and animals. Their products consistently prove to be the cream of the crop, winning many awards, and rightfully earning the title of ``World's Best Cheddar.'' For decades, they have been earning top marks around the country and world, from respected competitions like the U.S. Championship Cheese Contest, the American Cheese Society, and even the World Championship Cheese Contest. The recognition is well deserved after a century of hard work, dedication, and commitment shown by generations of farmers across New England and New York.  Not only do they produce excellent products, Cabot's farm families are leaders of sustainability. They have worked to strengthen green farming practices, some of which provide Vermont families with electricity, and even their own electricity processing plant. They have made continuous efforts to create more sustainable practices, from conserving water to installing solar panels. Cabot and their members have been awarded prestigious honors, such as U.S. Dairy Sustainability Awards and New England Green Pastures Award for Outstanding Dairy Farm of the Year. Cabot has recently been classified as a B Corporation, the first dairy cooperative to achieve that certification, which shows the strong commitment they have to being a socially and environmentally responsible business.  I have had the pleasure to work with Cabot, creating lasting memories and an incredible working relationship that has supported the dairy industry in Vermont and the entire country. I am privileged to host Cabot at my annual Taste of Vermont event, and guests of the reception are often greeted by the distinct Cabot plaid upon entering the Kennedy Caucus Room on Capitol Hill.  As a Vermonter, I am proud of the incredible service Cabot, its leaders, and their farmers provide for our State, our economy, and the larger dairy industry. Cabot truly represents the essence, values, and traditions of what makes Vermont special. I congratulate Cabot and their dairy farmers on 100 years of hard work and success.                          ____________________
