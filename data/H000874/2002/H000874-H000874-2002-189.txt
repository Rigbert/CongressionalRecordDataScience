Speaker, I rise to join my colleagues in speaking about the genocide, a genocide, unfortunately, that has not been acknowledged by some and, unfortunately, heightens the risk of its repetition. The massacre of Armenians in Turkey during and after World War I is recorded as the first State-ordered genocide against a minority group in the 20th century. Tragically, Mr. Speaker, it was not, as we all know, the last.  In the 87 years since this unspeakable tragedy, the world has witnessed decades of genocide and ethnic cleansing and wholesale persecution of people simply because of who they are: European Jews, Bosnian Muslims, the Tutsis of Rwanda, Kosovar Albanians, and others.  Mr. Speaker, we undertake this year's commemoration of the Armenian genocide in a world that is forever changed as we reflect on the terrible events of September 11. We understand that confronting irrational hatred and the evil which kindles it remains a constant challenge for us all.  Mr. Speaker, there are those who deny that there was an Armenian genocide, yet there is, of course, no lack of documentation of what occurred during that terrible time. In her powerful new book, A Problem From Hell: America and the Age of Genocide, author Samantha Powers points out that The New York Times gave the Turkish horrors steady coverage, publishing 145 stories in 1915 alone. According to Powers, beginning in March 1915, the paper spoke of Turkish ``massacres,'' ``slaughter,'' and ``atrocities'' against the Armenians, relaying accounts by missionaries, Red Cross officials, local religious authorities, and survivors of mass executions.  The U.S. Ambassador to Turkey at that time, Henry Morgenthau, Sr., cabled Washington on July 10, 1950 stating, ``Persecution of Armenians assuming unprecedented proportions. Reports from widely scattered districts indicate systematic attempt to uproot peaceful Armenian populations and through arbitrary arrests, terrible tortures, wholesale expulsions, and deportations from one end of the empire to the other, accompanied by frequent instances of rape, pillage, and murder, turning into massacre, to bring destruction and destitution on them.'' The tragedy, Mr. Speaker, is that similar language could have been applied during the 1990s in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Mr. Speaker, those reports came to us, and the West did little. The West did little until the middle of the 1990s and, when we acted, the killing and carnage stopped. Sadly, Mr. Speaker, at that time in 1915, no action, no action was taken to try to save the Armenians because their plight was deemed to be an ``internal affair'' of their government.  Mr. Speaker, I have the privilege of having chaired for 10 years the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, otherwise known as the Helsinki Commission. It oversees the implementation of the Helsinki Final Act, signed August 1, 1975 in Helsinki, Finland. That act, post-genocide of the 1930s and 1940s, adopted the premise that a nation's mistreatment of its own citizens would never be again an internal affair. To that extent, Mr. Speaker, the international community has, in fact, adopted the premise that we are our brothers' and our sisters' keepers.  Decades later, 6 million Jews would perish in the Holocaust before the community of nations would adopt the universal declaration of human rights. Then, as I have said, the Helsinki Final Act, some years later.  The declaration on human rights captured the world's revulsion of that traditional view of international relations and made clear a new norm: how a State treats its own people is of direct and legitimate concern to all States and is not simply an internal affair of the State concerned.                              {time}  1545  Mr. Speaker, I trust that all of us will urge our Turkish friends who were not involved in this genocide, but who now head their governments, to acknowledge and express their own horror at those acts taken in 1915.                          ____________________
