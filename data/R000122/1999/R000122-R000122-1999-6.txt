It is about time Congress acted. It is about time we took a nick out of poverty. It is about time we invested in working families and gave them, through their own efforts, theresources to raise their families, to raise them up out of poverty. We must give new hope to families who are working very hard in this economy to raise children, to move forward and seize the opportunity at the heart of the American dream.  I again commend Senator Kennedy for his great efforts, not just today, but for so many days on the floor, fighting for working families, fighting for economic justice for all our citizens.  I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1                         Raise the Minimum wage       A proposal in Congress to raise the minimum wage, now $5.15      an hour, by two increments of 50 cents each over the next two      years seems reasonable. This would still leave those      subsisting on these wages well below the federal poverty      level, but it would at least bring them some modest relief.      (The debate comes, by the way, as Congress voted itself an      average $4,600 raise.)       The argument is sometimes made that to raise the minimum      wage would reduce employment by raising employers' costs. We      see little indication over the past few years that the move      would shrink employment. For that matter, increasing the      minimum wage, by widening purchasing power, could      substantially help the economy and boost employment over the      long run.       It should also be noted that higher wages often mean      greater loyalty and effort on the part of employees. Thus,      whatever the increment of a higher minimum wage, that costs      could be more than offset by higher revenue and profits from      increased productivity and reduced turnover, hiring and      training costs.       It is interesting that in my states with the highest state      minimum wages, such as Massachusetts (now at $5.25 and to be      raised to $6.75 in two 75-cent increments over the next two      years), there are serious labor shortages. Recent increases      in those states' minimum wages have not brought about price      rises or layoffs, so far as such things can be measured.       But then, consider that the purchasing power of the current      minimum wage is about $2 less that of the minimum wage in      1968 (when the jobless rate was also very low). Further, it      should be noted that more than 70 percent of American workers      receiving the minimum wage are over age 25 or not longer in      school.       An increase to $6.15 would help take a nick out of poverty      and provide a more solid base for the economic expansion.      Congress ought to do it.
