 As my colleague knows, I don't take a backseat to anybody in terms of bipartisan approaches in healthcare. I have worked with Republicans--Chairman Hatch, chronic care. Senator Bennet and I worked on a bill with eight Democrats and eight Republicans. I appreciate your making this point.  As of this afternoon, as far as I can tell, no Democratic amendment has been adopted. You highlighted 11 Republican amendments getting adopted in just one committee. As we indicated, FOX News--not exactly hostile to some of the ideas being advanced by the majority--has certainly called them out on this.
