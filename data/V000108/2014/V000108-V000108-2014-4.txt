People ought to appreciate the discerning judgment that they bring to their work, their knowledge, their tireless work ethic, and the fact that they are fun to be around. They also are very selfless as far as providing for the protection of our Nation, to ensure also that it is done in as cost-effective a manner as possible.  I appreciate that the chairman enunciated the names of all of our staff because on this subcommittee it is a very seamless and indistinguishable process. The staff understand they are here to help every member of the subcommittee, the full committee, and of this House, whether we agree or not, to ensure that our legislative process and product is as good as it can be.  The final thing I will note is to thank personally the chairman for his leadership on this issue, for his dedication to public service. My father always told me it took a very strong man to be a gentleman. Mr. Chairman, you are the consummate gentleman, and I thank you for that and for your friendship.
