CAMPBELL. That's correct. In fact, I have here a letter from the Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs, which states that while they support section 3(b)'s integration of Johnson O'Malley, ``the program must continue to be conducted in accordance with its authorizing statute.'' Another letter dated March 28, 1998 states that the JOM parent committee will continue to have the authority to approve and disapprove tribal plans to integrate funds within the 477 program. I ask unanimous consent that each of these letters be placed in the record.
