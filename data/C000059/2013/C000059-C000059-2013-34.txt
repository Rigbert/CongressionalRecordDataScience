Speaker, I rise today with my colleague Raul Ruiz to pay tribute to a hero from our Congressional districts, Sheriff Larry D. Smith. Today, I ask that the House of Representatives honor and remember Sheriff Smith, who dedicated his life in service to our community. On Friday, April 19, 2013 Larry passed away at the age of 68 at his home in La Quinta, California after fighting a long battle with cancer and pneumonia.  Larry received a bachelor's degree in public management from Pepperdine University. His 36-year career in law enforcement began in 1966 in the small town of Blythe, California near the Colorado River, where Larry was a deputy sheriff. As he earned promotions throughout his career, he brought up many deputies through the ranks, including current Riverside County Sheriff Stan Sniff. In 1987, Smith was promoted to Chief Deputy Sheriff in Riverside County. As Chief of the Corrections Division, he oversaw the financing and construction of two modern jails, including the Southwest Detention Center in French Valley that opened in 1993.  As Larry was completing his law studies and planning on retiring to open a practice, then-Sheriff Cois Byrd encouraged him to run for Sheriff of Riverside County. He was challenged in his first term, but ran unopposed for his second. During Larry's tenure as sheriff, he presided over a department that currently has 3,000 deputies and polices 17 cities, in addition to 300 square miles of unincorporated areas. He also helped the county acquire land from the federal government that eventually became the Ben Clark Training Center near March Air Reserve Base, where law enforcement officers and firefighters from throughout the state train. The county's largest jail, the Larry D. Smith Correctional Facility in Banning, bears his name. Larry was also the first man to serve as both sheriff and coroner after the two departments merged.  Larry served our community for eight years from 1994-2002, and was the 11th of 13 men to serve as sheriff in the department's 120-year history. He was succeeded by Sheriff Bob Doyle. Even after Larry had retired, he would still offer his counsel to his successors on corrections, a field in which he was considered an expert. He also mentored other sheriffs as President of the California State Sheriff's Association and strongly advocated education for his deputies.  According to his wife Toni, Larry's approach to his career was influenced by his Midwestern roots. She said, ``He was a very dignified, humble man. He was an Illinois farm kid who saw good in everyone . . . He always talked about doing things for the right reason, not just in big things or in small things, but in all things.''  Larry was also active in the Palm Desert Community Presbyterian Church, where he mentored pastors on running an organization, and programs for those battling addiction. A scholarship will be established in his name to help people afford to attend the Ranch Recovery Center in Desert Hot Springs, which provides treatment alternatives for drug and alcohol abuse, according to his wife.  On Saturday, May 4, 2013 a memorial service will be held at the Palm Desert Community Presbyterian Church in Palm Desert, California. Smith is survived by his wife, a daughter and two sons.  The dangers our police officers face every day often go unnoticed and without remark. Each story is unique and humbling for those ofus who, far from the dangers they have faced, live our lives in relative comfort and ease. In the case of Sheriff Smith, he was blessed to have the love and strength of his family to help him along the way. I extend my condolences to Larry's family and friends; although Larry may be gone, the light and goodness he brought to the world remain and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
