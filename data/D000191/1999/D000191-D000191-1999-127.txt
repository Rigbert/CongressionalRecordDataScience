Speaker, one of my constituents, Margaret Ingram of Albany, Oregon, has made it a personal crusade to encourage people to keep journals and otherwise record the events of their lives. The following bill was introduced in the Oregon Legislature at Ms. Ingram's request. In honor of her efforts and to advance the pursuit of journal and diary-keeping, I would like to insert the text of that resolution in the Congressional Record.                  OREGON HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 8 Encourages citizens of state to observe Memoir Trail 2000: Celebrate                                the Past.       Whereas history is an account of the past events of all      persons, individuals, families and communities; and       Whereas historians are writers of history, preparers of      records and finders of past events, and the people of Oregon      and the United States are historians; and       Whereas history informs, measures change, preserves a way      of life and shares stories, legends and tales; and       Whereas today's Oregonians are the proud inheritors of a      trail of personal stories that winds through the past      century; and       Whereas recording and collecting memoirs will help preserve      the past for future generations; and       Whereas the year 2000 will mark the end of the 20th Century      and the beginning of another 100 years; now, therefore,       Be It Resolved by the Legislative Assembly of the State of      Oregon:       That we, the members of the Seventieth Legislative      Assembly, encourage all citizens to observe Memoir Trail      2000: Celebrate the Past.                               ____________________
