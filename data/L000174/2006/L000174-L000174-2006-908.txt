President, we have Senators who wish to speak.  On several occasions, but publicly and privately, I have asked the distinguished senior Senator from Utah if he purports to quote me, to try to at least get within the ballpark of accuracy. I realize that is probably a failing and useless request after hearing him misquote me again the last few minutes, but I renew the request, and I hope that he would do that.
