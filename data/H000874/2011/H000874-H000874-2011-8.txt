Speaker, 6 months ago the Speaker said that he thought the 1-year extension of the middle class tax cut was a short-term gimmick. He said that 6 months ago of the year extension. So we're somewhat concerned about the commitment to a 1-year extension. But that aside, let me say to my friend that one of the problems I'm worried about is, A, whether we can get this work done in the next 14 days because we know that even if we had a conference, they take a long time. There are very significant differences between us. In fact, we have compromised on something that you indicated in our colloquies about a week ago was very important, and that was the Keystone bill, which your side believes will create a significant number of jobs. That of course is in the bill that the Senatesent us, because even though the Democratic majority was not for it, they cared enough about the middle class tax cut to compromise.  Unfortunately, I will tell my friend, too often we have seen on this floor unwillingness to compromise, even on your bills. We had a CR on the floor on March 15; unfortunately, 54 of your Members walked away from that. On April 15, we had a continuing resolution to keep the government open; 59 Republicans walked away from that. On June 23, you left the Biden talks. On July 22, Speaker Boehner walked away from the debt limit negotiations with he and the President. On August 1, 66 Republicans walked away on the debt limit extension, which was your bill--not ours, your bill. On November 17, some 101 Republicans walked away from passing an appropriations bill which would keep three agencies funded. On December 16, 86 Republicans walked away from the bill to fund the balance of government. So I might say to my friend, it seems to me what we're doing today is walking away today from those 160 million people, walking away from those 48 million seniors, and walking away from those 2.3 million unemployed.  I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________
