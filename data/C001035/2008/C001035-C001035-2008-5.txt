President, as the 110th Congress draws to a close, I rise to say thanks and farewell to one of our hardest working and most dedicated Members, Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico.  Pete Domenici's story is truly the American dream come to life. The son of immigrants, Pete worked in the family grocery business, earned a college degree, taught school, obtained a law degree, and served in local government before his election to the Senate.  I cannot overlook one vitally important part of his biography, and that is his stint as a pitcher for a farm team of the old Brooklyn Dodgers. Who knows how much different history would be if his fast ball had had a little more ``pop'' to it?  For 36 years, however, baseball's loss has been the Senate's gain. The character developed by athletic competition--determination, hard work, a sense of fair play--is fully evident in Pete's six terms in office.  When the people of New Mexico chose Pete Domenici to be the longest serving Senator in their State's history, they chose wisely. His tireless work on a wide range of issues has helped to ensure a better future for all Americans, rural or urban, large State or small. He is a respected leader on some of the most important challenges of our time, such as strengthening energy security, curbing nuclear proliferation, and promoting sound Federal budget policy.  Pete's understanding of the budget process is matched only by his appreciation of the critical role fiscal responsibility plays. His service on the Budget Committee established his universal reputation as one of the Senate's hardest working, most intelligent, and best-informed Members. His focus on results rather than the limelight led one colleague to describe him as having ``a terminal case of responsibility.''  Senator Domenici is also a true champion for biomedical research, and especially for Americans suffering from mental illness. He has worked unceasingly over the years to increase the understanding and to eliminate the stigma associated with mental illness. He has led the effort in the Senate--first in partnership with Senator Paul Wellstone, and later with our colleague Senator Ted Kennedy, to pass legislation that requires insurers to cover mental illness in the same way they cover physical illnesses.  Thankfully, those efforts have finally borne fruit with the inclusion of his legislation in the economic stimulus bill, the stabilization bill passed in the Senate. It is a victory not just for Senator Domenici's longstanding efforts but also for the estimated 50 million Americans who suffer from some kind of mental illness. It is a testament to his dedication and his compassion.  Senator Domenici's tenure has been marked by vision, common sense, and acommitment to results. When he became chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee in 2003, Senator Domenici set to work to craft the first major comprehensive energy bill in more than a decade. Many thought it would be impossible to put together the bipartisan support to pass the Energy Policy Act of 2005, but Senator Domenici did it. That landmark law laid the foundation for American energy independence, the responsible use of existing resources, and the development of new technology. We can build on that foundation by following the model he set of informed debate and thoughtful consensus.  While most of his many accomplishments have national significance, there is one that may not be well known outside of his home State. More than a decade ago, Pete Domenici introduced a program that has helped the schoolchildren of New Mexico learn trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship. This program is called ``Character Counts.'' It fully epitomizes what Pete Domenici is all about. It fully describes his legacy because, with Pete Domenici, character has always counted.  Senator Domenici leaves this Chamber with an overflowing and bipartisan store of good will and gratitude. We are all losing an outstanding colleague. On a personal note, I am also losing an outstanding Washington DC neighbor, since Pete and his wonderful wife, Nancy, live right down the street from me. I am pleased to be among the many Senators offering thanks for his years of service and best wishes to him and to Nancy.                              Gordon Smith  Mr. President, for nearly 70 years, the film ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' has inspired Americans and people around the world with its uplifting story of how one man of conviction and character can make a difference. Today, I am honored to offer a few words to the Mr. Smith of our time: Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon.  Senator Smith came to Washington to make a difference--and he has. He and I were sworn into the United States Senate on the same day, January 7, 1997. Although his State and mine are a continent apart, we quickly found that we had a lot in common.  It has been a joy to work with Gordon Smith on so many important issues. Of course, where I come from, the name ``Senator Smith'' conjures up not just the beloved movie but also a towering, real-life figure, and my inspiration in public service. Although Margaret Chase Smith of Maine and Gordon Smith are separated by time, they are united in a spirit of independence and integrity. Both served with strong convictions but with respect for the principles of others. Both spoke up when they saw wrongdoing. Both had extraordinary courage that allowed them to speak out when they thought their own party was in error. Both saw the aisle not as a barrier to progress but as a bridge to reaching consensus on behalf of the American people.  This focus on moving forward is especially apparent in Gordon Smith's effective work on issues of great importance in Maine, in Oregon, and everywhere in between--health care, tax relief, small business, equal rights, and foreign policy. These challenges are ones that require careful consensus-building, a responsible approach that has defined Gordon Smith's service here.  Gordon Smith is simply a wonderful person and an extraordinary leader. We all remember the terrible tragedy he suffered with the loss of his son during his service here, a terrible tragedy that gave him and his family such sorrow. But it is typical of Gordon Smith that out of that tragedy, he chose to do something to help prevent other families from enduring the tragedy of the loss of a child. That is so typical of Gordon Smith--always thinking of others, always trying to do what is right, always committed to public service.  ``Smith'' is one of the more common names in the English language, but in this Chamber the name has special meaning, one of uncommon principles and extraordinary accomplishments. It reminds us of a cherished film, of the great lady from the State of Maine, Senator Margaret Chase Smith, and now of Senator Gordon Smith. I thank him for his service and his friendship, and I wish him all the best in the future.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
