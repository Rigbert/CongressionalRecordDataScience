 President, I would like to take a moment today to recognize an armchair explorer who never left the Northeast but brought the world to the United States. In 1809-1810 in the town of Bradford, VT, Mr. James Wilson fashioned the first terrestrial and celestial globes made in the United States. In doing so Mr. Wilson gave to all Americans an invaluable tool that would be used for centuries to come.  A self-taught and passionate cartographer, James Wilson started the first geographic globe factory in Bradford. He achieved such great success that soon after he and his sons opened a second factory in Albany, NY. Wilson Globes set the standard by which all other globes were measured, achieving such perfection that in 1827 he argued to Congress there was no longer a need to import them from abroad.  The accomplishments of James Wilson and his sons are treasured in the picturesque town of Bradford. So much so that the Bradford Historical Society commissioned the Williamstown Art Conservator to repair the historical society's Wilson globe--one of the few remaining in the world. Funds for this project were received from across the Nation. Understandably, the town takes great pride in this small piece of history that they can call their own. Although Mr. Wilson only ever saw a few hundred miles of this great country, he was responsible for bringing the world to most Americans. We applaud James Wilson for the legacy he left us. Furthermore, we applaud the Historical Society and town of Bradford for recognizing Mr. Wilson's remarkable gift and their dedication to preserving the past for our future.                          ____________________
