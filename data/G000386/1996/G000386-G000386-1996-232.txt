 President, as I have said, 9 of the 14 proposed general officers positions are already occupied. Of the nine occupied positions, one is filled by a lieutenant general, one is filled by a major general, one is filled by a general selectee, and six are filled by acting brigadier generals.  So, Mr. President, it seems like these vacant--again, I emphasize the word ``vacant''--war-fighting positions are already well covered. They are filled.  Mr. President, there is one thing about all this that really bothers me, and that is the one vacant position. I want to talk about that one vacant position. Of all of the positions, the vacant one seems like the most important one, and ought to be filled: assistant commander of the 2d Marine Division. It is not like there is a gaping hole in the command structure. As I understand it, the division's chief of staff is doing the job. He is a senior colonel, who is getting excellent experience, experience that is preparing him for promotion to general. But if this position is as important as I think it is, why is this position not filled? Why is the Marine Corps fattening up headquarters staff with generals when one of its three divisions is short a general officer?  If war fighting is the top priority--and that is what the Marines say, not what the Senate Armed Services Committee said--why are so few generals assigned to war-fighting billets? Only 25 percent of all Marine generals are in combat posts. About 50 percent of the Marine generals are in the Washington, DC, area. Are these misplaced priorities? Are Marine generals in the wrong place? If the Marine Corps is short of generals in war-fighting commands, then some generals should be moved. They should be moved from lower priority command headquarters to top priority combat jobs.  Mr. President, war fighting is not the driving force behind the proposal for additional Marine generals. If it were, the proposal would be linked to force structure. But it cannot be linked to force structure because, as I have shown so many times with my charts--and I will not get them out again--the structure is shrinking. This happens to be the Marines--down from 199,000 in 1987 to 172,000 right now.  So it seems to me that might not argue for fewer generals, but it surely does not argue for 12 more generals. So it had to be hooked up to something else. That something else is vacant headquarter billets. That is what is driving this.  The Marine Corps commissioned an independent study to figure out exactly how many more generals were needed to fill these posts. The study was conducted by Kapos Associates, Inc. That study is fairly thick, and it was referred to by Senator Warner in his response to my statement in June. I do not know whether he actually labeled it as the Kapos study. But I think it is the only one he could have been referring to. It is entitled ``An Analysis of U.S. Marine Corps General Officers Billet Requirements.'' It is dated March 20, 1996. The Kapos study concluded--this study that I just held up--that the Marine Corps needed--get this. This study recommended 37-to-95 more generals to fill key positions. I suppose I ought to look at that 37 to 95 and say to myself, ``Well, heavens. If they are only going to suggest 12 more, we ought to be happy, and just sit down and shut up.'' But the Kapos study did not look at the war-fighting requirements. That is very basic to why I think you had better be careful when you quote from this study. It did not look at force structure. It had one goal--fill those big, fat headquarter jobs sitting out there. The question was not in this study: How many generals do we need? Instead it was: How many positions do we fill? In no way did this Kapos study address the threat. It did not look at future force requirements or the need to downsize. This was a study about how to take and hold important bureaucratic real estate--pure and simple. That is the engine driving the mushrooming headquarters problem that is so much of a concern to General Sheehan of the Atlantic Command.  As a force shrinks, generals are flocking to the headquarters. That is my response to the second argument. The first one was the Goldwater-Nichols rationale.  The second is what is stated in the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee report saying that these are not needed for war-fighting capability, and that is opposite what the Marine Corps said in this document that I put in the Record, where they want these 14 Marine generals, that that is for war fighting.  It also sounds like the Marines want to be top-heavy with rank like theother services. As I said, the other services are top-heavy. The Marines, from the standpoint of general to marine ratio, is a lot more efficient and effective. It's less top-heavy but if this goes through, then that means that the Marine Corps will be chubby with general officers the same way the Navy is chubby with admirals at a time of the force is shrinking. I suppose the Marines feel like they have been shortchanged.  The other services have far more generals. They probably want a place at the negotiating table in the Pentagon, too. The Army has 291 generals, or 1 general for every 1,748 soldiers. The Navy has 218 admirals, or 1 admiral for every 1,994 sailors. The Air Force has 274, 1 general for every 1,461 airmen. The Marine Corps, 68 generals, or 1 for every 2,568 Marines. Big is good. Small is bad. The Air Force is the smallest, or the fattest. The Marine Corps is the leanest. But we do not fix this problem by making the Marine Corps chubby like the Navy, for example. But that is what happens if we give the Marine Corps 12 additional generals. We fix this problem by making other services lean like the Marine Corps.  In other words, I am suggesting that, at a time when the Secretary of Defense is saying that our primary responsibility is improvement and modernization of our capability, we ought to be very cautious about wasting money on administrative overhead. The Marine Corps used to be really lean and mean.  You will see here, at the height of World War II, there were 485,000 marines, 72 generals. The 72 generals is about the same as today, 68 to be exact. But the Marine Corps was three times bigger back then--1 general for every 6,838 marines.  Clearly, the other services are top-heavy compared to the Marines. You do not balance the load by making the Marine Corps top-heavy like the other services. You fix it by making the others less top-heavy, by reducing the number of generals. You fix it by giving them the right number of generals, a number that matches force structure.  Lastly, the proponents for more Marine generals suggest that technology creates a need for more generals. That is possible. But the reverse is also possible. Technology could reduce the need for so many generals and admirals.  When it comes to technology, you ought to take, for instance, CCCI. That stands for Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence. Billions of dollars are going to be spent for CCCI. That technology gives the top generals and admirals the capability to run the battle from the Pentagon. It gives them the ability to communicate directly down to the smallest units operating anywhere in the world. Just read Colin Powell's book ``My American Journey,'' and you can see how he did it. He just by-passed all the redundant service headquarters in between.  So CCCI could reduce the need for having so many generals forward deployed with the infantry battalions.  So I do not understand the need for more Marine Corps generals when the Marine Corps is downsizing. The number of generals should be decreased as the Marine Corps gets smaller.  The request for more generals reminds me of the recent words of Marine Corps Gen. John Sheehan, Atlantic Command. I quote him extensively on June 18 in my case to freeze the defense infrastructure costs. General Sheehan argues that ``Headquarters should not be growing as the force shrinks.''  Continuing to quote, ``The growth in headquarter staff jobs is threatening the military's war-fighting capabilities.''  So I think General Sheehan from inside the Marines hits the nail on the head. He has identified the root cause of the problem. He helps me understand why the Department of Defense cannot cut infrastructure costs. The growth in headquarter staff is being driven by one powerful force--excess generals and admirals searching for a mission. Each senior officer needs a place to call a home and to hoist a flag. Every senior officer needs a command, a headquarters, a base, a staff, or a large department of some kind somewhere someplace. Each new general funded in this bill will need some new piece of real estate.  All of this makes me think that more Marine generals now is not a good idea. Responding instead, as the Secretary of Defense, Mr. Perry, says, modernization is our greatest need.  So the amendment that I am going to offer this afternoon would put a lid on the number of Marine generals at 68 where it is today, not making a decision for the authorization committee, as the distinguished members of the authorization committee are saying that I am impinging upon their decision. You go ahead and make whatever decision you want. But should we spend money on 12 more Marine generals when the force structure has shrunk by 27,000? Or should that money instead be spent on modernization, as the Secretary of Defense says? It seems to me that is where it belongs.  I am going to yield the floor. I still have some other pieces of supporting information and documentation I want to put in the Record, and I ask to do that.  I yield the floor.                           Amendment No. 4453   (Purpose: To provide $150,000,000 for defending the United States     against weapons of mass destruction, and to provide offsetting                reductions in other appropriation amounts)
