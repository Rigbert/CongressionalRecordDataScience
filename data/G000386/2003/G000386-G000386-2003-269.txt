 President, I rise today to introduce the Long-Term Care and Retirement Security Act. This legislation, which I sponsored in the 106th and 107th Congress with my distinguished colleague from Florida, Senator Bob Graham, would ease the tremendous cost of long-term care.  The bill that Senator Graham and I are re-introducing today would allow individuals a tax deduction for the cost of long-term care insurance premiums. Increasingly, Americans are interested in private long-term care insurance to pay for nursing home stays, assisted living, home health aides, and other services. However, most people find the policies unaffordable. The younger the person, the lower the insurance premium, yet most people aren't ready to buy a policy until retirement. A deduction would encourage more people to buy long-term insurance.  Our proposal would also give individuals or their care givers a $3,000 tax credit to help cover their long-term care expenses. This would apply to those who have been certified by a doctor as needing help with at least three activities of daily living, such as eating, bathing, or dressing. This credit would help care givers pay for medical supplies, nursing care and any other expenses incurred while caring for family members with disabilities.  One family that would benefit from this legislation is the Gardner family of Waterloo, IA. Ruth Gardner is a 70-year-old mother of nine who suffers from a degenerative tissue disorder, Scleroderma, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure and is a breast cancer survivor. For the last 3 years her nine children, their spouses and numerous grandchildren have worked tirelessly to fulfill Ms. Gardner's wish of spending her last months with dignity and respect at home.  While Ms. Gardner's wish may seem small, the task of managing her care is not. Each week family members meet to organize their schedules in an effort to provide over 20 hours of daily care for Ms. Gardner. Working relentlessly, and at a considerable cost, the Gardner family manages to provide around-the-clock care while balancing both work and their family lives. All this effort comes at a great cost, both emotionally and financially. The Gardners have been able to locate some funding to help support the care for Ms. Gardner; however, the family continues to bear considerable costs. These costs include weekly nursing visits that cost $102 per visit, emergency response service at $30 a month, daily hospice service at $32 an hour and not to mention the hours and hours of personal time donated by the family.  The Long-Term Care and Retirement Security Act would help the 22 million family caregivers like the Gardners. A $3,000 tax credit would help to pay for Ms. Gardner's monthly hospice care, weekly nurse visits or help to hire a nurse to cover some of the time that the family currently donates. This legislation would also help the increasing number of families placed in the difficult situation by allowing them to purchase long-term care insurance. Had this legislation been enacted earlier, long-term care insurance wouldhave been an affordable option for Ms. Gardner, alleviating the difficult situation that her family currently faces.  As it has in the past, the bill that Senator Graham and I are introducing today has been endorsed by both the AARP and the Health Insurance Association of America. A companion bill sponsored by Representatives Nancy Johnson, Karen Thurman and Earl Pomeroy is pending in the House of Representatives.  An aging nation has no time to waste in preparing for long-term care, and the need to help people afford long-term care is more pressing than ever. I look forward to working with Senator Graham and our colleagues in the Senate to get our bill passed into law as soon as possible.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1335       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
