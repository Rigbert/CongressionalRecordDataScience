Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding me this time. I was not going to get into this, but I want to thank the chairman of the committee.  As the chairman knows, I have great concern about LaPlata, Maryland, that was struck by a tornado some months ago, and literally two-thirds of the town was obliterated, knocked down, along with almost a thousand homes destroyed.  I was hopeful that there would be some additional funds in this bill. That was not possible. But I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member, with whom I talked during the course of the conference, for their assurances that during the course of the next weeks that we will address this problem. I want to be able to assure the folks of LaPlata that we have not forgotten them and we are going to assist them as soon as we possibly can; and I thank the chairman for his assurance on that and working with me to accomplish that objective, and I thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Obey) as well.
