 President, we have had a very good week in the Senate. We had an opportunity to pass the Tax Increase Prevention Act an hour or so ago, which is going to make an important difference not only in the lives of a great number of individual Americans, but also it will be very critical in continuing this robust economy that America currently enjoys.  I commend Members of the Senate for stepping to the plate and passing this very important measure, and particular congratulations go to Chairman Chuck Grassley of the Finance Committee for his tenacious pursuit of this very important piece of legislation.                          ____________________[Page S4463]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                      TAX INCREASE PREVENTION ACT  Mr. McCONNELL.
