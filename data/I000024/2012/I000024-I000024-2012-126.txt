But let me make sure I have in the Record, and I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter dated September 15, 2011, which was 9 months ago, signed by 32 Members of this Senate, including the occupier of the chair right now, the Senator from West Virginia.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                               Washington, DC, September 15, 2011.     John D. Rockefeller,     Chairman, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and          Transportation, Dirksen Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.     Kay Bailey Hutchison,     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and          Transportation, Dirksen Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Rockefeller and Ranking Member Hutchison: A      bill that was recently introduced by Senator Inhofe, S. 1335,      the Pilot's Bill of Rights, has been referred to your      committee. It currently has 32 cosponsors, 13 of which are      members of the Commerce Committee. With a majority of      committee members having already voiced their support for      this legislation, we respectfully request that you hold a      committee or subcommittee hearing and markup of this      legislation.       During the drafting of this legislation, Senator Inhofe      worked extensively with the Aircraft Owners and Pilot's      Association and the Experimental Aircraft Association, both      of which have strongly endorsed this bill, as well as private      aviation attorneys. It became clear during this process that      several common sense changes should be made to enhance the      relationship between the FAA and general aviation, and those      were incorporated into the bill.       First, the bill requires that in an FAA enforcement action      against a pilot, the FAA must grant the pilot all relevant      evidence, such as air traffic communication tapes, flight      data, investigative reports, flight service station      communications, and other relevant air traffic data 30 days      before the FAA can proceed in an enforcement action against      the pilot. This is currently not done and often leaves the      pilot grossly uninformed of his alleged violation and      recourse.       Second, the bill also allows for federal district court      review of appeals from the FAA, at the election of the      appellant, and states that the NTSB shall not grant deference      to the FAA in an appeal, should the pilot choose to go the      NTSB route. Both of these things are done because too often      the NTSB rubber stamps a decision of the FAA, giving wide      latitude to the FAA and making the appeals process      meaningless.       Third, this bill requires that the FAA undertake a Notice      to Airmen Improvement Program, requiring simplification and      archival of NOTAMs in a central location. The process by      which Notices to Airmen are provided by the FAA has long      needed revision. This will ensure that the most relevant      information reaches the pilot. Non-profit general aviation      groups will make up an advisory panel, which we believe will      give pilots a seat at the table when deciding how the NOTAM      system can be improved.       Fourth and finally, the FAA's medical certification process      has long been known to present a multitude of problems for      pilots seeking an airman certificate. The bill simply      requires a review of the FAA's medical certification process      and forms, to provide greater clarity in the questions and      reduce the instances of misinterpretation that have, in the      past, led to allegations of intentional falsification against      pilots. Non-profit general aviation groups, aviation medical      examiners, and other qualified medical experts will make up      an advisory panel to advise the Administrator, again giving      the right people a voice in the overall determination.       Again, we hope that you will schedule a hearing and markup      of this legislation that is extremely important to the      general aviation community. As many of us sit on your      committee, we look forward to being an active part of this      process.           Sincerely,         James M. Inhofe; John Hoeven; Jim DeMint; Roger F.
