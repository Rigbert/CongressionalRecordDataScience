Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of one of the most dedicated, selfless and kind-hearted individuals I have ever had the pleasure of knowing, Mr. Glenn Hackney. He is a friend and a true unsung hero for whom I have the deepest admiration.   Glenn moved to Alaska before statehood, arriving in 1948. He served in the State House from 1972 to 1976 and the State Senate from 1976 to 1980. From the time of his arrival, Glenn began a life of service to Alaska. Mere words today cannot express the profound impact Glenn has had on the lives of many; he has truly done so much good, for so many people. Glenn has always lived by the simple words of Abraham Lincoln and I quote: ``To ease another's headache is to forget one's own.''   In that same vein, Glenn's service to his community runs deep. I recall a time when Glenn was cleaning up the streets of Fairbanks, AK and was struck by a vehicle. He suffered many broken bones and endured great pain, but never held any ill-will towards the driver. In fact, he was more concerned for the driver's well-being than his own. Soon thereafter, he was back on the street once again doing his part to clean up the community. Glenn is a strong, silent leader; a gentleman and a dear friend. I hope that this body will join me in recognizing his contributions to society and the great state of Alaska.                          ____________________
