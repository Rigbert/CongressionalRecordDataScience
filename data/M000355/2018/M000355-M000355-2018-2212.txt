 President, I move to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 195.  I ask unanimous consent that there now be up to 10 minutes of debate, equally divided, on the motion to concur and that following the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on the motion to concur with no intervening action or debate.
