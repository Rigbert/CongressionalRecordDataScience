 You do.  Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to my good friend the majority leader, this is an outrage I do not understand. My staff tells me we did not receive the draft amendment until late last night, and this morning we were told it was final. We got the draft late last night, and this morning we were told it was final.  Now, look, we have debates around here about a lot of things, but one of the things we have typically not been unable to reach an agreement on is the Iran issue. I do not know what the problem is here. A little communication ought to be able to bring us together behind something we can speak to unanimously, with a goal that I think we all have in this body--virtually everyone--which is to do everything we can to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear-armed country.  So there is no reason in the world why we cannot resolve whatever minor differences we have and move forward. We certainly do not want to take a step backward. And there are Members on my side of the aisle who are concerned that the way the measure is currently crafted could actually be a step in the wrong direction. It could have been a drafting error. But what is wrong with sitting down on a bipartisan basis, looking at the language, and making sure we get it right and achieve the goals that I think virtually everybody in the room would like to achieve? There is nothing to get angry about. A proper response would be to work out our differences and to go forward.  Timeliness is an issue. We need to do this quickly. We can all agree to that on both sides of the aisle. I say to my friend, I don't think there is anything to be outraged about. Why don't we work out the differences and pass the resolution?
