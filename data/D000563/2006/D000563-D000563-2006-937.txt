President, may I say to the Senator from Texas, ``aggravated felony,'' as defined by this bill, could include aiding or abetting shoplifting. So in that extraordinary case, where someone is a legal permanent resident and is about to be deported because of changes we are making in the law, this amendment would give one last chance to that person to go to the Secretary of Homeland Security and say: Please, don't ask me to leave the country because I drove the car when my girlfriend shoplifted a DVD. It would cause extreme hardship to my mother and father, who are American citizens. And the Secretary can say: No. And it is not reviewable by a court. He will be deported. But it at least leaves that last option. These are people who are currently legally in the United States whom we are trying to protect.
