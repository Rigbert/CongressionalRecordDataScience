Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support to this legislation. In addition to all the reasons given by my colleagues from Pennsylvania and California on why it should pass, let me add one, and that is that unless we update our commercial launch legislation, we are going to become, as a Nation, more and more uncompetitive with foreign countries for the commercial space launch business, particularly nonmarket countries such as Russia, China, and the Ukraine.  I do think it is important to rebut somewhat the allegations that have been made by the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Hoyer]. First of all, this Congress has not been parsimonious with Mission to Planet Earth. The appropriation legislation that was approved by the House provides about a billion dollars for fiscal year 1997 for this purpose. That is a little bit less than was requested, but it still is a significant amount of money, $1 billion.  The problem exists in providing a proper balance for the various types of programs that NASA is involved in. Both the OMB budget lines and the Republican balanced budget budget lines give NASA a declining amount of money between now and the year 2002.  The OMB line is about $2 billion less than that which the Congress approved, but the fact is that NASA's budget is going to be pinched as time goes on and we cannot provide for unchecked increases in any of NASA's accounts.  The fear that I have, looking at both the OMB and the Republican budget lines is that if we do have unchecked increases in Mission to Planet Earth, then NASA's science will be squeezed almost down to a zero amount, and that would be a shame if we ended up squeezing science in fiscal year 1998 and fiscal year 1999 because the scientific accomplishments with NASA's robotic programs have been literally amazing in the 35 years of NASA's existence.  So let us face it, we do not have enough money for everything. We would like to have more, but at the same time we have to have a proper balance between the various accounts. I think that the appropriation bill and the Committee on Science authorization bill does that. The reductions in the request for Mission to Planet Earth end up being reflected in more money being spent in NASA's science accounts.  We want to have both a healthy Mission to Planet Earth and a healthy Committee on Science budget for the next 2 or 3 fiscal years. I think that this bill will provide for the leveraging of the Government dollars in Mission to Planet Earth. And if we can attract private sector dollars to replace public sector dollars, so much the better.                              {time}  1715
