President, we have an amendment on which we are prepared to vote. I mention this only because I have heard constantly on the other side how anxious they are to move this bill forward. I brought this amendment up, proposed it, and am ready to go to vote all within 7 or 8 minutes. I don't want anyone to think we are trying to hold anything up. Frankly, I think this whole bill would have been finished this afternoon if we had not been interrupted for the ergonomics.
