President, I am delighted to commend Yarmouth Elementary School in Yarmouth, ME, on being named a 2018 National Blue Ribbon Exemplary High Performing School. Serving 358 students from second through fourth grade, this outstanding school is one of only 349 schools across the country to receive Blue Ribbon recognition from the U.S. Department of Education.  Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Schools Program honors public and private schools that are either academically superior in their States or that demonstrate significant gains in student achievement. The schools singled out for this national recognition are models of high educational standards and accountability.  The Blue Ribbon designation continues a tradition of quality education in Yarmouth. The graduation rates and assessment test scores for the town's K-12 school district consistently are among the highest in the State of Maine.  Yarmouth Elementary School's mission statement, ``Empowering all students to create fulfilling lives in a changing world,'' is carried out daily. Students focus on the core values of fairness, citizenship, respect, and caring. The core curriculum has a strong focus on math, literacy, science, and social studies, with special programs that recognize each student's individual learning style.  Rich and diverse learning opportunities are a part of every child's experience, from art and music, to library skills and physical education. The school involves all students in extracurricular activities, which helps forge a strong school community where students are connected and encouraged to pursue their interests. Throughout the curriculum, students are also taught to use technology both effectively and responsibly.  Faculty, parents, and community members are committed to both academic excellence and each child's social, emotional, and physical health. Faculty work to ensure a safe and secure learning environment and to develop strong and collaborative relationships with parents and community members. An active parent-teacher organization supports enriching educational activities, and the Yarmouth School Foundation promotes excellence and innovation by funding a number of projects and initiatives.  I applaud the administrators, teachers, staff, and parents of Yarmouth Elementary School. Together, they are succeeding in their mission to build students' confidence and generate momentum for learning. I am pleased that the U.S. Department of Education has selected Yarmouth Elementary School for this well-deserved honor, and I congratulate the entire school community for this outstanding achievement.                          ____________________
