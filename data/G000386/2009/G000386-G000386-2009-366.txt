 President, I would just as soon leave it at 5 minutes because we have all of these other colleagues. We just spent an hour on one amendment, and we have plenty of people on both sides of the aisle. I think we ought to be tolerant toward our colleagues and make this debate very short. If you want me to do it in 4 minutes, I will do it in 4 minutes.
