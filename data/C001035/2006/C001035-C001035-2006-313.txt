President, I also note planning and response capabilities are already too weak in many States, as evidenced by the recent DHS reviews. We don't want to splinter those efforts further by needlessly multiplying their Federal points of contact. For many reasons, therefore, preserving those close working ties with other agencies within the Department, the new FEMA must stay within DHS.  Allow me to briefly summarize a few more of the provisions of the bill before yielding to my colleague from Connecticut. First, as I mentioned, it establishes a strong position for the administrator of the new USEMA. This administrator would be nominated by the President, confirmed by the Senate, and have the standing of a Deputy Secretary. Day by day, the administrator would report to the DHS Secretary, but the bill explicitly provides that direct line of communication to the President as well as the authority to make recommendations to Congress on which I have already elaborated.  The amendment provides for two directors. There was an issue on which we worked very closely with DHS. The language we have incorporates the feedback we got from the Department. Both of these individuals--which, again, would be high-level individuals within the Department--would be nominated by the President, confirmed by the Senate, and would provide the administrator and the Department with highly qualified professionals in preparedness and mitigation and in response and recovery.  Our amendment would give the administrator responsibility for managing preparedness grant programs. The Presiding Officer knows, as the former mayor, that i you control some of the money that goes out to State and local governments, if you are helping to allocate that funding, you will have a good relationship with State and local governments. Inevitably, the authority follows the money. This is going to ensure we have far better coordination. This is an important restoration of authority to this agency. It was a mistake, in my view, that authority was taken away from FEMA. That will help ensure better oversight and coordination of preparedness at all levels of government.  I have talked about how important I think these regional structures are for the new agency. It will ensure that Federal officials are familiar with the people, the vulnerabilities, the capabilities, and the resources of the regions they protect, and they won't be introducing themselves to strangers on unfamiliar ground when disaster strikes.  I could not help but be struck during our hearings by the fact that so many individuals from FEMA were sent from region 1e--the region that the Senator from Connecticut and I represent, New England--down to New Orleans. I like to believe we New Englanders can handle anything, but the fact is, the response would be far more effective if we had people who are in the area who worked every day with the emergency management officials in the area, who understood the weaknesses and the strengths of particular States rather than sending someone from the Northeast down to the hurricane region or vice versa in times of an ice storm or some other disaster.  Further recognizing the importance of multilevel governmental coordination, the bill creates a national advisory council on emergency preparedness and response that would be made up of State and local officials, emergency management professionals from the public, private, and NGO sectors to advise the administrator of USEMA. This is important. We know the critical role nonprofits and the Red Cross play. They, too, should be involved in the training, the planning, the exercising. We learned from our investigation that, too, was flawed. This will help ensure the agency's thinking does not proceed in a stovepipe, but is fortified with comments and expertise from a wide range of vitally concerned partners.  Our amendment addresses the glaring and urgent needs highlighted in our investigation of Hurricane Katrina. As I mentioned, I am very pleased we have the support of so many experts. Nothing could speak more eloquently of the need for reform or be more encouraging than to receive the words of support from those who do put their lives on the line every day to protect the American people. We also have the support of the administration for this proposal.  Amending the Homeland Security appropriations bill by adding the provisions of our USEMA bill will go far to ensuring in a timely way that we will have a far more effective structure to protect our fellow citizens' lives and livelihoods from disaster.  I am very pleased this is a bipartisan effort. I recognize the work of the Senator from Connecticut who has led, with me, the investigation of the committee and the drafting of this legislation. We are also grateful for the input of Senator Lott who knows better than any of us--except his fellow Senators from Mississippi and Louisiana--the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. I am grateful for his input, as well as the input from Senator Carper who also has worked very hard on this issue.  Finally, I recognize all of the participation of the Presiding Officer, Senator Coleman. There was no more loyal committee member who came to virtually every single hearing, participated actively, and contributed greatly to our investigation. I thank him for his work, as well                               Exhibit 1                                                    July 11, 2006.     Hon. Susan Collins,     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,     Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Collins and Ranking Member Lieberman: On      behalf of the Homeland Security and Defense Business Council      (the Council), I am writing to support S. 3595, the U.S.      Emergency Management Authority Act. On behalf of the private      sector, the Council is pleased to endorse this measure to      reinvent, protect, and strengthen FEMA. The new FEMA,      reconstituted as the U.S. Emergency Management Authority,      would ensure that the nation will be better prepared to      address, either, natural or man-made disasters.       The Council is a non-partisan, non-profit 501 C6      organization that comprises the major companies that serve      the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Our focus is to      align private sector resources to support the mission of the      Department on behalf of the nation's interests. The Council      is pleased to see language that elevates the importance of      FEMA within DHS and reunites preparedness functions with      response capabilities.       The Council supports provisions of S. 3595 that would:        Give the new U.S. Emergency Management Authority statutory      protection against actions that could diminish its      capabilities and effectiveness;        Ensure that the Administrator of US-EMA has direct access      to the President and serves as Principal Emergency Management      Advisor, at all times;       Reunite preparedness functions with response capabilities      to reestablish the agency's comprehensive responsibilities      and restore the full range of working relationships with      state and local government; and       Strengthen the Authority's regional focus with federal      strike teams for a faster and more coordinated response and      to provide better familiarity with the states in which the      strike teams will operate.       Thank you for your continued commitment to improving      emergency management and response and for engaging the      private sector to leverage industry best practices. Should      you have additional questions, please do not hesitate to      contact me anytime.           Sincerely,                                                Michael M. Meldon,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                  National Troopers Coalition,                                                    July 11, 2006.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     Chair, Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee,          Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the 40,000 state      troopers and highway patrol men and women represented by the      National Troopers Coalition (NTC), we are writing to commend      you for your legislative efforts to ensure that law      enforcement is directly involved in the continuing efforts to      prevent and respond to acts of terrorism.       As an organization, NTC joins with our colleagues in other      national law enforcement organizations in support S. 3595,      the United States Emergency Management Authority Act of 2006.      We are convinced that retaining the Federal Emergency      Management Agency within the Department of Homeland Security      will provide better coordination among all agencies serving      as first responders to both natural disasters and terrorist      attacks, Recent history has demonstrated the importance of      the law enforcement community responding promptly, along with      others, to both terrorism and natural disasters for the      safety and well-being of our citizens.       The NTC thanks you for your leadership on this issuc and      your continued efforts to ensure the public that we will have      the authority and resources to meet our public safety      responsibilities under any and all circumstances.           Sincerely,     Casey Perry.                                  ____                                      International Association of                                                  Fire Chiefs,                                       Fairfax, VA, July 13, 2006.     Hon. Susan Collins,     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and          Governmental Affairs, Dirksen Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Collins: On behalf of the nearly 13,000 chief      fire and emergency officers of the International Association      of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), I would like to endorse your amendment      to establish a U.S. Emergency Management Authority (USEMA).      We believe that this amendment will resolve many of the      problems with the nation's emergency management system by      improving the structure and granting greater autonomy to the      federal preparedness and response activities within the      Department of Homeland Security (DHS).       We believe that your approach is the best way to reform the      nation's emergency preparedness and response system, because      it keeps these activities within DHS. The IAFC is concerned      that the removal of the Federal Emergency Management Agency      (FEMA) from DHS will splinter the federal government's      emergency preparedness and response efforts, which will force      local jurisdictions to cope with competing directives from      both an independent FEMA and the other DHS agencies. In      addition, it is important that the FEMA stay within DHS and      continue developing relationships with the U.S. Coast Guard      and the other DHS components to better leverage their      collective assets.       We believe that the U.S. Emergency Management Agency      established by your amendment would ensure more autonomy for      the federal emergency preparedness and response activities.      The USEMA Administrator would report directly to the      Secretary of Homeland Security and the directors of      Preparedness and Response and Recovery divisions would be      Senate-confirmed. Your amendment also would insulate the      USEMA from reorganization and diversion of assets, functions,      or missions. The IAFC believes that USEMA's independence      could be further guaranteed by ensuring that the USEMA      Administrator would report directly to the President during a      Stafford Act--defined ``emergency'' or ``major disaster'' to      ensure that all federal assets are available without delay.      We greatly appreciate the provisions in this amendment that      ensure that the U.S. Fire Administrator remains at a level      equivalent to an Assistant Secretary in the department.       We thank you for your continued leadership on behalf of      America's fire service. Please feel to contact Ken LaSala,      Director of Government Relations, at (703) 273-9815 x347, if      we can be of assistance.           Sincerely,                                             Garry L. Briese, CAE,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                                       Grand Lodge                                   Fraternal Order of Police ,                                    Washington, DC, July 10, 2006.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental          Affairs,     U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,     Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security and          Governmental Affairs,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Collins and Senator Lieberman, I am writing      on behalf of the members of the Fraternal Order of Police to      advise you of our strong opposition to any legislation or      amendment that would remove the Federal Emergency Management      Agency (FEMA) from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security      (DHS).       Since the terrorist attacks on the United States in      September 2001, our nation has worked diligently to defend      itself from future attacks and, in so doing, have also      dedicated significant resources to respond to large scale      critical incidents, both natural and man-made. Yet the      primary mission of the Department of Homeland Security must      always be the prevention of future attacks against the United      States, and this mission is best entrusted to law enforcement      at the local, State, and Federal levels.       However, our nation will face natural disasters which      cannot be prevented, and, for these, we must be prepared to      respond. Law enforcement is a critical component of this      response and law. enforcement at every level of government      seeks to increase the speed and effectiveness of delivering      emergency services to those in need. Clearly, the mass      devastation brought to the Gulf Coast by Hurricane Katrina      showed that greater coordination and communication is needed      to respond to incidents of such magnitude. This goal cannot      and will not be achieved if FEMA is removed from DHS. Indeed,      the F.O.P. believes that such a move would reduce our      nation's overall level of preparedness.       The F.O.P. also strongly supports greater participation of      law enforcement in planning emergency response at every level      of government. We will continue our review of various      legislative proposals addressing the need for emergency      management reform at the Federal level. I thank you both in      advance for your consideration of the positions we have laid      out to date and look forward to working with you to improve      our nation's ability to prevent terrorist attacks and prepare      for future critical incidents. If I can provide any further      information on this issue, please do     not hesitate to contact me or Executive Director Jim Pasco in      my Washington office.           Sincerely,                                                 Chuck Canterbury,     National President.                                  ____                              Major Cities Chiefs Association,                                       Columbia, MD, July 6, 2006.     Hon. Susan Collins,     Chairwoman, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental          Affairs,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Madame Chairwoman: On behalf of the Major City Chiefs      Association, I am writing to commend you on developing      legislation that will strengthen the Department of Homeland      Security (DHS). S. 3595, the United States Emergency      Management Authority Act, is a step in the right direction;      making DHS more efficient with limited disruption and      reorganization.       Prevention is the best investment in response capability.      Like the President, we believe that the best way to respond      to a terrorist attack, be it biological, chemical,      radiological, nuclear or conventional explosive is to prevent      it from happening in the first place. Intelligence,      investigation, and preparedness are all law enforcement      functions that will help prevent terrorists from striking      again.       As you know, we feel strongly that preparedness and      prevention are too dissimilar from response and recovery for      these functions to operate under the same common chain of      command. That is why we welcome the creation of a separate      and distinct Office of the Prevention of Terrorism reporting      directly to the Secretary. This structure will not permit the      dilution of the prevention mission under layers of      bureaucracy. We are also pleased that the bill does not break      apart the Preparedness Directorate keeping it on equal      footing with response and recovery. We strongly support the      Preparedness Directorate and its vital role at DHS.       We look forward to working with you and supporting your      efforts to ensure that DHS has a clear prevention mission. If      we can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to      call on Tom Frazier at 410-433-8909.           Sincerely,                                                     Harold Hurtt,     President.                                  ____                                           National Association of                                   Police Organizations, Inc.,                                    Washington, DC, July 11, 2006.     Hon. Susan Collins,     Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,     Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairwoman Collins and Ranking Member Lieberman: On      behalf of the National Association of Police Organizations      (NAPO) representing more than 238,000 law enforcement      officers throughout the United States, I would like to thank      you for introducing S. 3595, the ``United States Emergency      Management Authorization Act of 2006,'' and advise you of our      support, particularly in regards to Section 517 of the      legislation. If enacted, this bill will establish within the      Department of Homeland Security (DHS) an Office for the      Prevention of Terrorism.       The ``United States Emergency Management Authorization Act      of 2006'' will create an Office that would be responsible for      coordinating anti-terrorism policy and operations between DHS      and state and local law enforcement. The Director of the      Office for the Prevention of Terrorism would have the      important task of developing better intelligence sharing      methods between DHS and state and local law enforcement      agencies. This new Office would also ensure that vital      homeland security grants are adequately focused on terrorism.       This legislation recognizes the importance of standardized      coordination and communication between the country's local,      state, and federal law enforcement in preventing acts of      terrorism within the United States. Section 517 of the      ``United States Emergency Management Authorization Act of      2006'' will help ensure that state and local law enforcement      are properly supported, trained and informed in order to      prevent terrorism before it occurs.       NAPO thanks you for your continued support of law      enforcement and I look forward to working with you to get      this important legislation passed. If you have any questions,      please feel free to contact me, or NAPO's Legislative      Assistant, Andrea Mournighan, at (202) 842-4420.           Sincerely,                                               William J. Johnson,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                            Advocates for EMS,                                                    July 11, 2006.     Sen. Susan Collins,     Chair, Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs          Committee, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington,          DC.       Dear Senator Collins: Advocates for EMS, a not-for-profit      organization founded to educate elected and appointed      officials and the public on important issues affecting EMS      providers, writes in support of S. 3595, the United States      Emergency Management Authority Act of 2006. The measure      establishes the U.S. Emergency Management Authority (USEMA)      and creates a more autonomous agency within DHS, similar to      the U.S. Coast Guard. S. 3595 also retains the Federal      Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) within the Department of      Homeland Security (DHS).       Advocates believes that moving FEMA out of DHS would only      continue the instability that FEMA has experienced since its      move to DHS. While FEMA responsibilities include natural      disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes and floods; it should      also have an integrated response plan for other emerging      threats. Removing FEMA from DHS would only add additional      hurdles for EMS providers in terms of their ability to work      with the federal government in response to a natural or man-     made event.       Creating a U.S. Emergency Management Authority (USEMA) and      the autonomy provided by the legislation is a step forward in      making FEMA efficient and effective in providing emergency      medical services responders the leadership and resources they      need. In addition, Advocates also supports the establishment      of the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) and its responsibilities      the legislation provides. The CMO plays a key role in      coordinating medical response within DHS and other federal      agencies.       Advocates thanks you for your continued leadership on this      issue and looks forward to working with you in the future on      first responder issues.           Sincerely,     Advocates for EMS.                                  ____                                         International Association                                             of Fire Fighters,                                    Washington, DC, July 11, 2006.     Hon. Susan Collins,     Hon. Joe Lieberman,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Collins and Lieberman: On behalf of the      nation's more than 270,000 professional fire fighters and      emergency medical personnel, I applaud you for your efforts      to reform the nation's emergency preparedness and response      system. We strongly support the enactment of legislation to      reform FEMA within the Department of Homeland Security and      appreciate your continued leadership in moving this effort      forward.       Congress must enact comprehensive reforms to ensure that      FEMA will be able to provide an effective response to      disasters. These reforms, such as reuniting disaster      preparedness and response functions within FEMA and utilizing      an all-hazards approach to emergency preparedness, can and      should be made within the Department of Homeland Security.       We believe that proposals to return FEMA to its status as      an independent agency would hinder efforts to reform our      nation's emergency response system. Removing FEMA from DHS      would create competing agencies, sowing confusion among      emergency responders. Furthermore, such an approach would      undermine an all-hazards approach, leading to a perception      that DHS deals with terrorism, while FEMA is in charge of      natural disasters.       When Congress created the Department of Homeland Security,      it did so with the understanding that emergency preparedness      and response are at the core of our nation's homeland      security. Your amendment to the Homeland Security      Appropriations Act helps to fulfill this mandate by ensuring      that FEMA remain an integral part of the Department of      Homeland Security.       Thank you for your leadership on this vital issue. We      greatly appreciate your continued support for the nation's      front-line emergency responders and look forward to working      with you in the coming weeks to improve the way our nation      responds to disasters.           Sincerely,                                                   Barry Kasinitz,     Director, Governmental Relations.                                  ____                                                Congressional Fire                                           Services Institute,                                    Washington, DC, July 10, 2006.     Hon. Susan Collins, Chair,     Hon. Joe Lieberman, Ranking Member,     Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental          Affairs, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Collins and Lieberman: The response to      Hurricane Katrina revealed a number of things regarding our      nation's level of readiness for major disasters. On the one      hand, it showed the courage and dedication of local first      responders--our firefighters, law enforcement, and rescue      personnel--who made many sacrifices of their own in order to      respond valiantly to the greatest natural disaster in our      nation's history. On the other hand, it exposed the      limitations of our national response capabilities,      exacerbated by failures in leadership at all levels of      government.       While there is no doubt fundamental changes need to be made      to our national response structure, we are greatly concerned      by recent efforts in the Congress to remove FEMA from the      Department of Homeland Security. The separation would      diminish the resources of both FEMA and DHS, and create a      duplication of critical components resulting in a      bureaucratic nightmare for first responders and local      governments.       In 2002, we were one of nine organizations that signed on      to a white paper outlining our position on the creation of      the Department of Homeland Security. The first recommendation      was that FEMA ``be at the core of the Department of Homeland      Security.'' Our organization has not altered its position.      FEMA can succeed but it will require strong leadership,      proper resources, and better execution of the roles and      responsibilities by FEMA and its partners.
