For more than four decades, Charles Jordan was the gold standard for civic participation. He was an inspired public servant, a determined community leader and a stalwart advocate for parks and what they mean to the quality of life in our cities.  As the first African American elected to the Portland City Council and later as the city's parks and recreation director, Charles was a tireless advocate for diversity and inclusion. His work to protect community landmarks and Portland's prized natural areas earned him national recognition, including being appointed by President Ronald Reagan to the President's Commission on Americans Outdoors and by President Bill Clinton to the American Heritage Rivers Initiative Advisory Committee. Charles also served on the board of The Conservation Fund for 20 years, and became the first African American to lead a national environmental organization when he served as chairman of the organization's board of directors.  Like me, Charles Jordan was a tall guy who went to school on a basketball scholarship but found his calling in public service. His passion for equality, fairness and positive change improved the lives of many. Under Charles' tenure, the Portland Parks and Recreation Department increased the impact that parks had on everyone's lives, particularly children. Thanks to his leadership, the number of parks and natural areas in the City of Portland increased from 184 to 228, creating the opportunity for more and more families of all income levels to enjoy the outdoors. His innovative work led to Portland's award of the National Gold Medal in 2011 as the best parks system in the Nation from the American Academy for Park and Recreation Administration and the National Recreation and Park Association, the Nation's leading public park and recreation organizations.  His dedication to providing open spaces for children to play, along with safe community centers for families to gather, were the result of his inherent belief that all people must be treated with respect and dignity. In 2012, one of Portland's most popular community centers was renamed the Charles Jordan Community Center, a fitting tribute to the advice he gave to many kids:       Model the way. You never know who is watching and wanting      to be just like you.  In addition to all his hard work I have already mentioned, Charles also served as my go-to person on senior issues. His insight and advice always helped me see the right path forward. For that, and many other reasons, his loss has left a void.  Oregon commemorates his leadership in parks, conservation, providing access to the outdoors for all Americans, civic involvement and civil rights. My thoughts are with his wife Esther, his son Dion, and his daughter Trish. Charles was a true giant of our State, and he will be deeply missed.                          ____________________
