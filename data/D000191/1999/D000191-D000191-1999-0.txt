Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2879 directs the Secretary of the Interior to insert on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial a plaque, a plaque that would commemorate the speech of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., known as the ``I Have A Dream'' speech.  Several years ago, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis), who was present and was one of the speakers that famous day in 1963 along with Dr. King, was instrumental in a campaign by school children and others in establishing a permanent exhibit at the Lincoln Memorial commemorating the important civil rights events, including the ``I Have A Dream'' speech that occurred at the Memorial.  It is our understanding that H.R. 2879 is noncontroversial and that it is consistent with what has been done previously at the Memorial to commemorate similar events.  I strongly support passage of this legislation and this permanent commemoration of that historic speech in American history.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
