 President, no one has been more tenacious in fighting for adequate funding for HIV/AIDS than the Senator from Pennsylvania. I thank him for his important contribution.  His amendment is such a good idea that it has been approved on both sides of the aisle. Mr. President, I recommend we move forward and approve the amendment on a voice vote.
