 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a great leader in public service, Judge R.W. Dyche III of London, KY. Judge Dyche is retiring from the Kentucky Court of Appeals, Third Appellate District, First Division, after 20 years of honorable service. He began his legal career as a clerk for the law firm of Allen & Bledsoe, and after the firm dissolved,he opened his own office. He accepted an appointment as a judge of the 27th Judicial District in 1978 and 8 years later was appointed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals.  Judge Dyche plans to take some time off to begin his retirement. From there he said he has a couple of possibilities lined up. I am sure his wife Jane and his sons Robert and John are looking forward to seeing more of him.  On June 12 of this year, The Sentinel Echo published an article highlighting Judge Dyche's accomplishments while in office as well as the excellence with which he carried out his job. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                        [From the Sentinel Echo]                  Judge Dyche Retiring After 20 Years                         (By Carl Keith Greene)       Twenty years after his appointment and subsequent election      to the Kentucky Court of Appeals Judge R.W. Dyche III will      retire on June 20.       Dyche, 55, who began his career as a law clerk for Baxter      Bledsoe and Larry Allen, served also as Laurel District Judge      for eight years.       ``I look forward to a new chapter, learning new things,      learning different things, I've become even more convinced      lately that when you quit learning you begin dying. I'm      learning a few new things,'' he said in an interview      Thursday.       Dyche entered the legal profession because, ``It's all that      ever interested me. I had a phase of electronics and      electrical engineering. But starting about my freshman year      in high school it's all that ever interested me.''       He said the best thing about being a judge for him is      ``getting to see the good side of humanity. Unfortunately,      along with that you also see the bad side.''       He said the good side is made up of generosity, love,      attorneys who go out of their way to represent their client      well--sometimes at no cost--people who just want to do the      right thing.       On the bad side, he has seen families who fight, or people      who abuse or neglect children. He said these are the two      worst scenarios.       Though it is hard to pinpoint a typical case Dyche has      heard, he said in the criminal side, anymore, is a drug case,      and generally, the most common grounds for claimed error is      illegal search and seizure.       ``Very often the drugs are found on the person or in close      proximity and the only out they have is to say the search is      illegal.''       In civil court, ``unfortunately domestic things are growing      and growing and growing. It's such a good thing that we're      going to get a family court here soon,'' he said.       Dyche estimated there are approximately 75 percent of      affirmations of lower court cases and 25 percent reversals.       He said the case that stands out in his memory is from      about 1988 or 1989 ``where a child was taken from the mother      at the hospital before she ever got the chance to show      whether she could be a good mother, based on past history and      predictability. I wrote an opinion reversing that saying, it      could be under very close supervision but she should be      given the chance.''       He said he prides himself, and his staff, on being able to      write opinions that litigants can understand, not written in      what is called ``legalese'' but written in plain English and      short concise form so they can understand why they won or      lost.       Dyche is a 1968 graduate of London High School. He earned      his bachelor's degree from Danville's Centre College and his      law degree at the University of Kentucky College of Law in      1975.       He and his wife of 27 years, Jane, also a lawyer, have two      sons, Robert, 24, who is in law school and John, 13, an      eight-grader at North Laurel Middle School.       In his years in the Laurel judicial system he has seen the      court system grow from one circuit judge, Bob Helton; one      district judge, Lewis Hopper; one trial commissioner, Dyche;      and one pre-trial services officer, Fred Yaden.       Now there are two circuit judges, two district judges, at      least two trial commissioners, and three or four pre-trial      officers, he said. The case load has, with the county, grown      so much.       ``I can remember in the late 70s when Les Yaden was sheriff      there was Les, Oscar Brown, Earl Bailey as deputies and      Evelene Greene and Les' daughter Janie making up the entire      Sheriff's office staff.''       Now there are many, many who are needed.       Looking ahead, Dyche said he is going to take some time off      to start out with, and is exploring, a couple of      possibilities.       ``I'm certainly not going to be idle,'' he said.       He said he has learned a few things about doing his job      since he began the journey.       ``I came into this at age 27 single, and early on I was      having and I was lecturing a father, `Oh you need to do this,      you need to do that. Here's what you do with your son.' I was      giving him down the road. The guy looked at me and said,      ``Buddy, you got any children?'' I said `no.' He said `huh.'      ''       He concluded, ``I'm much more understanding when things      don't go exactly as you planned in raising children.''       ``I appreciated how good everybody's been to me, the      cooperation of the people, my staff, Sandy Slusher and Julie      Ledford, and particularly my friend Fred Yaden. I'll be      around. I won't go far.''                                  ____                           A Tribute to Dyche          (By Sandy Slusher, Appeals Court Judicial Secretary)       Working at the Court of Appeals has been the highlight of a      career and life that I thought would never happen. I took a      job years ago with the law firm of Allen & Bledsoe. Robbie      Dyche was in law school and clerked at the firm. I found him      a most interesting person when he was in the office.       When the firm dissolved, Robbie decided to open his own      office. He asked if I would like to work for him, and I      eagerly accepted. That was 30 years ago. His practice grew      but he realized public service was truly his calling. In 1978      he accepted an appointment as district judge under the new      judicial reform system, Eldon Keller, (the Circuit court      Clerk at the time), hired me as a deputy clerk. I still was      able to work with Judge Dyche, as well as Judge Lewis Hopper.       In 1986, Judge Dyche was appointed to the Kentucky Court of      Appeals and asked if I would like to work as his secretary.      The judge, Julie Ledford, our staff attorney, and I went to      Frankfort together to be sworn in.       In Judge Dyche's office, we have formed a small family unit      supporting each other through divorce, marriage, births,      deaths graduations, illnesses both in the office and in      extended family members. We have celebrated with each other      at the happy times, and embraced and consoled each other      through the heartbreaking moments. It had been so good.       Throughout Judge Dyche's tenure our office policy has been      to write opinions that are concise, strictly based on law,      easily understood by the average citizen as well as the      judiciary, and rendered as soon as possible. Matters      involving child custody always took precedent over other      matters and Judge Dyche consistently would volunteer to take      additional cases involving child custody in order to fast      track these matters through the Court.       I have formed friendships that will endure for the      remainder of my time on earth. If the opportunity presented      itself, I would do it all over without a moment of      hesitation!                          ____________________[Pages S6451-S6452]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                    TRIBUTE TO JUDGE R.W.
