Speaker, the House of Representatives is, in my opinion, the greatest legislative body in the history of the world. A large portion of the credit for that is due to the thousands of staff members who dedicate the better part of their adult lives to working within the halls of this democratic institution. For the past 24 years, I have been incredibly fortunate to have benefitted from the talented services of David Kirk Ramey.  Dave's tenure in the House dates back to before I was elected (when the Cold War existed and the Internet didn't), when he worked for my good friend and mentor, former Congressman Jerry Lewis (R-CA). Dave served Rep. Lewis from February 1985 through December 1992 as a Foreign Policy and Defense Analyst in the House Republican Conference, Policy Committee, and Research Committee. Months after being hired by Lewis, Dave welcomed to the Research Committee staff his good friend Flint Lewis (no relation to the Congressman). Alongside Jack Pitney, Guy Hicks, Kelly Cook Marcavage, Brenda Benjamin Reese, Todd Hauptli, Jim O'Malley, FrankGregorsky, Paul Ritacco, Lee Raudonis, Ed Slevin and others, Dave served for eight years in the House Republican Leadership.  According to former Staff Director Bob Okun, who hired Dave and under whom Dave worked during most of those years, Dave ``. . . distinguished himself as a top notch researcher and writer on Capitol Hill in the 1980s which served him so well through his thirty plus years on the Hill.'' Dave wrote for the 1988 Republican Platform Committee which was co-chaired by Rep. Lewis. Congressman Lewis told me that he has ``. . . always been very proud of the quality of our personal staff. One of the greatest among them has been David Ramey. To our knowledge, the only mistake Dave ever made was to leave our staff and to go and work for my buddy Ken Calvert.''  After I was first elected in November of 1992, Dave was one of the first staff members I brought on board as my Legislative Director. My first Chief of Staff, Ed Slevin, said ``Without a doubt, Dave is one of the best and the brightest. He was a great renaissance man for the Congressman.'' In 1997, Dave became my Chief of Staff when Ed left the Hill. Throughout his time in my office, Dave has demonstrated a tremendous gift for analyzing policies and finding solutions to complex legislative challenges. Many things have changed over Dave's 32 years in the House, but his sense of punctuality and neatness were always a constant.  He has also mentored a great number of staff members and interns who have served in my office, sharing with them the tremendous knowledge he possesses about our government, Capitol Hill, history and life in general. I believe it's fair to say nobody who spent time working in our office left without bearing the imprint of Dave's wonderful leadership. Some of the staff's favorite Daveisms include: ``Ounce for ounce, testosterone is more dangerous than plutonium,'' ``If you want one thing, ask for two,'' ``cc's are free,'' ``What gets scheduled, gets done,'' ``A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds,'' ``Don't go to law school,'' and the all-time favorite, ``The six most important words in the English language are: `I am sorry. I was wrong.' ''  In addition to working in my office, Dave has served as the CRAP Master, the head of the California Republican Administrative Personnel group (CRAPs), as well as Co-Chairman of the bipartisan California State Society. He graduated from the College of William and Mary in 1984 with a B.A. in International Relations and in 2010 received his Master of Arts with Highest Distinction from the Naval War College in National Security and Strategic Studies. When Dave steps down on October 31st to become a principal at Kadesh and Associates, it will mark the departure of the last staff member in my office who has served me since I was sworn into office in 1993. (The amount of file space that we will reclaim is practically unfathomable.) Dave's immeasurable contributions to my office, the constituents I have represented in Riverside and Orange Counties, and to our country are something for which we should all be very grateful. Personally, I have and will continue to value my friendship with Dave and wish him and his wife Jenny, their daughter Maddie and son Ben the very best and brightest future.                          ____________________
