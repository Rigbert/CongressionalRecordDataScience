 President, today I am reintroducing the Mowa Band of Choctaw Indians Recognition Act. This particular piece of legislation has passed the Senate three times in the past two Congresses. While I would prefer not to have to pursue congressionally granted recognition for the Mowa Choctaws, this course of action has been dictated by the institutional resistance of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to Federal recognition of the Mowa.  The Mowa Choctaws originally applied for Federal recognition in 1983. A State-recognized tribe with 3,500 members, the Mowa live within the boundaries of the original Choctaw Nation in Mobile and Washington Counties of Alabama. Mowa ancestors were signatories of the treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek which provided for the nonremoval of Indian families. Under the treaty, the signatories and their descendants were entitled to retain their rights to Choctaw citizenship.  The Mowa Choctaws have maintained an intense Indian identity over the past 160 years and have petitioned Congress for Federal recognition or to redress treaty grievances several times, beginning as early as 1836. Because of the failure of the BIA to act upon their petition in a timely manner, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs reported the bill in both the 102d and 103d Congress with the recommendation that the Mowa be granted full Federal recognition.  Only recently has the BIA acted upon the petition. In December, the BIA, after 12 years of delay, issued a preliminary finding denying the Mowa petition. However, the BIA only acted upon the petition when it became likely that the bill would pass the Congress and be sent to the President for his signature. I find this conduct at best suspicious, and most likely reflective of the BIA's longstanding bureaucratic disposition against the proposal.  Mr. President, I have no intention of dropping this issue, regardless of the position of the BIA. Indeed, Congress granted Federal recognition to one-half dozen Indian tribes last year without the approval of the BIA. Congress writes the laws of this land. Career and appointed bureaucrats do not. The Mowa case is stronger than scores of past petitions for recognition that were approved, and I will continue to work to see that Congress rectifies this bureaucratic injustice and grants the Mowa Choctaws the Federal recognition that they deserve.                          ____________________
