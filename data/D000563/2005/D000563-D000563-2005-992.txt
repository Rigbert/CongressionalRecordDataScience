I know better than most in this Chamber this is a very delicate issue, and I think they have handed it in a positive way, with clarity along the lines we are drawing, so we protect America and protect our troops and give them clear guidance in terms of conduct that is acceptable and up to American's standard of value. I thank the Senator for his leadership.
