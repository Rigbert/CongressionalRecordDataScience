 I would like to focus on just one of the numerous reasons I will oppose this legislation--the lack of any funding for the Travis VA Hospital in northern California.  Let me briefly describe the current situation for northern California veterans seeking inpatient health services. A veteran in this service area must drive an average of 4 to 5 hours, sometimes as many as 8 hours, to get to a VA acute care facility. The veteran's family, because they are so far from home, generally must stay in a hotel for the duration of the veteran's hospital stay. Once the veteran is released from the hospital, he and his family must drive back and forth from home to the VA facility again for check-ups. This story could be repeated as many as 450,000 times. That's right, nearly half a million veterans who used to have complete access to inpatient health services are now without adequate care.  I am appalled that the members of the Senate Appropriations Committee turned their backs on nearly a half a million veterans by not continuing to fund the replacement VA Hospital at Travis Air Force Base. This facility is desperately needed to replace the VA Medical Center in Martinez, CA which was closed in 1991 because of earthquake damage.  While awaiting the replacement facility at Travis, the Veteran's Administration has been forced to piece together a patchwork healthcare system. They have had to borrow bed space at Travis AFB's David Grant Hospital, and have transferred patients to facilities hundreds of miles away. I commend the VA for doing an admirable job in such a bad situation. Unfortunately, since the closure of the Martinez hospital, only 27 percent of that facility's inpatient services have been continued.  As bad as the situation has been, our veterans have been exceedingly patient. At the ground-breaking ceremony on June 2, 1994, attended by Vice President Gore, we all were optimistic that northern California's veterans would not have much longer to wait for quality healthcare. More than a year later, the plans are nearly complete and the land is ready to begin construction of the replacement hospital early next year. But instead, that land will stay empty, and nearly a half a million veterans will continue to be unserved.  The Travis VA Hospital is not a luxury to these veterans. They must drive between 4 and 8 hours to get inpatient healthcare. Should someone who served this country in war be required to drive from Washington, DC to New York City for healthcare? Now imagine that drive in order to obtain emergency medical care. That is correct. Veterans in northern California have no access to VA emergency services on evenings, weekends, or holidays. Currently, these veterans are forced to go to local health care facilities at either their own cost or at additional cost to the taxpayers. This situation is simply unacceptable, it is unnecessarily costly and is disrespectful of our veterans.  Please consider that this northern California area which would be serviced by Travis VA Hospital is one of the largest, most geographically dispersed, and highly populated veterans areas in the country. More veterans live in northern California than in 27 individual States and the District of Columbia. Would any Senator from those States allow the needs of every veteran in their State be ignored?  It is a sad day when the men and women who have served our country without question--and who have the right to expect their government to fulfill its promises--are now being told ``tough luck.'' It is simply unconscionable.  I appeal to my colleagues to honor the commitment we as a Nation have made to our veterans, and join me in voting against this bill that so fundamentally fails to address the needs of so many veterans. I also hope that the President will veto this legislation which so flagrantly ignores the needs of America's veterans.                             watertown, sd
