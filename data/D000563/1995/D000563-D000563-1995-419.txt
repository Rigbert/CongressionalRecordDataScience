Speaker, I thank my colleague from Connecticut.  In the past special orders have been political monologs from one side or the other, and I would hope in the future that could change, and in the spirit of trying to bring that change my colleague from Indiana, my Republican colleague, asked for an opportunity to speak earlier, and, realizing we only have maybe 8 or 9 minutes left, if we could enter into a dialog, I would be happy to at the moment.
