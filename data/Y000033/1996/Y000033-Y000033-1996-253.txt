Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1772, introduced by our colleague from Hawaii, Patsy Mink, to add some 36 acres of wetlands to the Oahu National Wildlife Refuge complex.  It is my understanding that these wetlands are essential habitat for a number of native Hawaiian birds and migratory waterfowl.  While the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has apparently been interested in acquiring the entire Waihe'e Marsh wetlands for a number of years, the purchase costs have been prohibitive.  This bill will simply tell the Secretary of the Interior that he may obtain these lands for inclusion in the refuge without providing any money to buy them.  While I intend to support H.R. 1772, I do so with the stipulation that if these wetlands are purchased by the Federal Government, all private property owners must be willing sellers and they must be fully compensated for their land interests.  I urge an ``aye'' vote on H.R. 1772.
