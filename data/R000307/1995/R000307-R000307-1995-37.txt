My concern is this.                              {time}  2200  My concern is that the agreement has been reached between two of our colleagues, and I was a tad sarcastic when I said neither were members of the authorizing committee and the appropriating committee, reserving 1 hour of debate, which is essential to the market promotion program, which is a very important program not only for the farm program but for American export and all of that.  However, we have at least 8, 10, 15 other amendments on means testing, the farm program, on the Export Enhancement Program, on the Food for Peace Program and on and on. Now, we are not going to have an hour of debate in that regard. We are going to announce that we are going to roll the votes until tomorrow.  I doubt if there are more than six people on the floor when we announce that, and so the debate will not be heard, but we will come in very quickly as of tomorrow, and we will vote, and we will roll those votes, and I have a little problem with that because it is so late at night.  I think each issue deserves this kind of a policy debate, and I will tell you that if some of these key amendments are passed which I consider to be very counterproductive I will urge every member of the Committee on Agriculture to vote no, and this bill will go down.  Now I am not for that. I am not for that. But I think we are getting a little far afield here in terms of reasoned debate on the very key amendments that affect our Nation's policy.  If that is what we are going to do I guess we will just have to go and do it. I do not want to be obstreperous, well, I do want to be obstreperous; I do not want to really pose an obstacle, but the gentlewoman is going to offer an amendment here on means testing. It should have a 30 to 45 minutes at least an hour debate. It will gut the current farm program.  Mr. Chairman, I withdraw my reservation of objection. If that is how we are going to do this, why, fine, but I am just telling you this is a hell of a way to run a railroad.
