Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend, the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Callahan) for yielding to me, and just let me say I am very much supportive of this language and the intent. The $2.5 million is really a small amount of money, and it does highlight an often neglected part of this whole trafficking problem and tragedy that we face, and that is, that the locally based indigenous organizations like Miramad in Russia or LaStrada in the Ukraine do not get much funding if they get funding at all, and they are in the front line when women are either trafficked out of the country and they are intercepted in some way, often through some good law enforcement, or when they are returned after being abused.  In order to break the cycle, these NGOs are right there providing treatment, providing psychological counseling and rescuing women.
