 Speaker, let us move forward to balance the budget, but not through savage cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, veterans' needs, children's needs, education, and environmental protection.  Yes, let us move forward to balance the budget, but not by giving huge tax breaks to the rich, building more B-2 bombers that the Pentagon does not want and by continuing to spend $125 billion a year on corporate welfare.  Yes, we can balance the budget, but not on the backs of the weakest and most vulnerable people in our society.
