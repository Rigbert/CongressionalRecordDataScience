 Mr. Speaker, for the new Members on both sides of the aisle, I am not one that demagogs this institution. As a matter of fact, I am very definitely opposed to demagoging this institution, on either side. Unfortunately, in the past we have seen that. It has denigrated the image of this institution with the American public.  I will tell my colleagues on either side of the aisle that all of us, every one of us, is adversely impacted by that kind of debate, but we ought to be honest in the debate. And I want to say to my friends on your side of the aisle, particularly as you attacked or raised in pointed terms how we were not accurately funding the committees, and say to my friend from Michigan who says this is a freeze. It is not. There is $8,170,000 that under the Contract With America would have to have been included in this budget, because you said that what Democrats were doing were taking detailees from the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense and having them on committees and not accurately reflecting the expenditures of the committee.  I will tell my friends, particularly those of you who voted ``no'' yesterday and who are for honesty in budgeting and putting before the American public what the expenses of the committee are. We have changed that policy just 22 months after it was so proudly adopted, where the committee last Congress said that committees would have to fund their detailees. We have now included back detailees off budget, so your committees that you are going to fund in this bill can spend $8,170,000 beyond what is in this budget.  If that is what you meant by reform, if that is what you meant by the Contract With America, I think some of uswere deceived, and frankly I think some of you were deceived. For that reason this is clearly not a freeze.
