 I ask unanimous consent that with respect to H.R. 2506, the foreign operations appropriations bill, upon the disposition of all amendments, the bill be read a third time and the Senate vote on passage of the bill; that upon passage, the Senate insist on its amendments, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, with the above occurring with no intervening action or debate.
