 Speaker, I rise today to call the attention of my colleagues to a resolution on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The following resolution was unanimously approved by 150 people from Vermont and New Hampshire who gathered at two events commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I agree with their statement that ``human rights, as articulated in the Declaration, will be best assured when all nations work in concert to promote and protect them.''  I call the attention of my colleagues to this resolution and ask that it be printed in the Congressional Record for their benefit: Resolution Calling on the United States Government to Fully Implement                the Universal Declaration of Human Rights       We call upon the United States government to ensure that      the laws, actions, programs and policies of the United      States, both foreign and domestic, including government      import, export, business and development policies affecting      the welfare of all of the peoples of the world, be consistent      with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and its two      implementing International Covenants of 1966;       Further, we urge the United States government to:       Ratify the 1966 Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural      Rights, the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of      Discrimination Against Women, the 1992 Convention on the      Rights of the Child, as well as the 1998 Rome Statute of the      International Criminal Court;       Satisfy all of its obligations under the Charter of the      United Nations, including the Statute of the International      Court of Justice with a declaration under Article 36 which      recognizes that Statute as compulsory;       Abide by Article 6 of the United States Constitution, which      states that all treaties signed and ratified by the United      States government are the law of the land;       Acknowledge that the United Nations was created by      international treaty and therefore payment of UN dues without      conditions is an obligation with the force of American law.       We also call on the governments of all nations to mandate      in every school under their jurisdiction, the teaching of the      principles and methods of non-violent social change, the      history of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and how      people throughout the world have struggled and continue to      struggle to make it a lived reality in the life of every      person, everywhere.       Unanimously approved by 150 residents of Vermont and New      Hampshire who gathered at two events commemorating the      fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human      Rights.       Further endorsed by the American Friends Service Committee      (Vermont), the United Nations Association (Vermont), the      World Federalist Association (New Hampshire and Vermont) and      Amnesty International (Hanover, NH).                               ____________________
