President, today I am pleased to introduce legislation to designate the United States Courthouse at 211 South Court Street, Rockford, IL, as the ``Stanley J. Roszkowski United States Courthouse.''  Stanley Roszkowski was raised in Royalton in southern Illinois, one of fifteen children. During World War II, he volunteered as a nose gunner on a B26 bomber, flying over 25 missions in Italy and Germany. After the war he went on to earn his B.A. from the University of Illinois and then his law degree, working as an appliance salesman to pay for school and meeting his wife Catherine along the way.  When he moved to Rockford, he opened up a successful law practice and became involved in his community. He gave up this practice when President Carter appointed him to the bench, serving for the next 20 years as a Federal Judge in the Northern District of Illinois. He became known for running a business-like but relaxed courtroom, and was praised by his peers for being extremely knowledgeable, fair and objective, and a gentleman at all times, with a wide breadth of experience and an uncommon sense of decency. As one lawyer put it: ``You couldn't ask for a better trial judge.''  Nobody worked harder than Stanley Roszkowski to make the United States Courthouse in Rockford a reality. He spent 6 years commuting between Rockford and Chicago building up the case load at Rockford and becoming Rockford's first full time Federal judge. As far back as 1992, he was writing countless letters and paying numerous visits to federal officials in Washington, DC, to make his case. It took many years but he never gave up on his belief that if the Federal courts had a physical presence in Rockford, it would be welcomed and frequently used by the lawyers there. He turned out to be right, and I am pleased that Representative Manzullo and I could work together to help secure the funding for it.  Whether in a bomber or on the bench, Stanley Roszkowski has dedicated his life to serving his country. I can think of no better way to honor his commitment than by naming this Federal courthouse, which he worked so tirelessly to see built, after him. I hope my colleagues will join me in enacting this tribute to him.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be placed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 387       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. STANLEY J. ROSZKOWSKI UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE.       (a) Designation.--The United States courthouse, located at      211 South Court Street, Rockford, Illinois, shall be known      and designated as the ``Stanley J. Roszkowski United States      Courthouse''.       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,      document, paper, or other record of the United States to the      United States courthouse referred to in subsection (a) shall      be deemed to be a reference to the ``Stanley J. Roszkowski      United States Courthouse''.                                 ______                                       By
