 A few days ago we heard from a distinguished group of members of the clergy from a variety of churches and synagogues who serve as members of the Interfaith Alliance. The Alliance is a national, grassroots, non-partisan, faith-based organization of 150,000 members who come from over 65 religious traditions. These men and women of faith promote the positive and healing role of religion in public life, and challenges all who seek to manipulate or otherwise abuse religion for sectarian or partisan political purposes. They came to the United States Capitol to denounce the despicable charges made against Senators, and to urge, as many of us have, that this involvement of religion in the confirmation process come to an end. I would like to enter into the record the statements of some of the participants in the event where the Alliance's members came together for that purpose.  Specifically, I would like to have printed in the Record the remarks of Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, the President of the Interfaith Alliance, the remarks of Rabbi Jack Moline, the Vice-chair of the Alliance, and the remarks of the Right Reverend Jane Holmes Dixon, the Immediate Past President of the Alliance. These statements are moving and persuasive and important. I would hope that my Republican colleagues would read them and take them to heart.  The demagoguery, divisive and partisan politics being so cynically used by supporters of the President's most extreme judicial nominees needs to stop.  I ask unanimous consent to have those remarks by clergy printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  (From Hill Briefing, July 29, 2003)                 (Remarks by Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy)               Religion and the Senate Judiciary Hearing       Good morning. Welcome to this Press and Hill Staff      Briefing. My name is Welton Gaddy. I serve as President of      the Interfaith Alliance, a national, grassroots, non-     partisan, faith-based organization of 150,000 members who      come from over 65 different religious traditions. The      Interfaith Alliance promotes the positive and healing role of      religion in public life and challenges all who seek to      manipulate or otherwise abuse religion for sectarian or      partisan political purposes.       Last Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee's discussion      on William Pryor's nomination to the 11th Circuit Court of      Appeals in Atlanta deteriorated into a dramatic demonstration      of the inappropriate intermingling of religion and politics      that raised serious concerns about the constitutionally      guaranteed separation of the institutions of religion and      government. Such a meshing of religion and politics in the      rhetoric of the Senate Judiciary Committee cheapens religion      and diminishes the recognized authority of the Committee to      speak on matters constitutionality. The debate of that day,      though alarming and disturbing, has created a teachable      moment in which we will do well to look again at the      appropriate role of religion in such a debate. That is why we      are here this morning.       Religion plays a vital role in the life of our Nation. Many      people enter politics motivated by religious convictions      regarding the importance of public service. Religious values      inform an appropriate patriotism and inspire political      action. But a person's religious identity should stand      outside the purview of inquiry related to a judicial      nominee's suitability for confirmation. The Constitution is      clear: there shall be no religious test for public service.       Within a partisan political debate, it is out of bounds for      anyone to pursue a strategy of establishing the religious      identity of a judicial nominee to create divisive      partisanship. That, too, is an egregious misuse of religion      and a violation of the spirit of the constitution. Even to      hint that a judiciary committee member's opposition to a      judicial nomination is based on the nominee's religion is      cause for alarm. How did we get here?       In recent years, some religious as well as political      leaders have advanced the theory that the authenticity of a      person's religion can be determined by that person's support      for a specific social-political agenda. So severe has been      the application of this approach to defining religious      integrity that divergence from an endorsement of any one      issue or set of issues can lead to charges of one not being a      ``good'' person of faith.       The relevance of religion to deliberations of the Judiciary      Committee should be twofold: one, a concern that every      judicial nominee embraces by word and example the religious      liberty clause in the constitution that protects the      rich religious pluralism that characterizes this nation      and, two, a concern that no candidate for the judiciary      embraces an intention of using that position to establish      a particular religion or religious doctrine. In other      words the issue is not religion but the constitution.      Religion is a matter of concern only as it relates to      support for the constitution.       Make no mistake about it, there are people in this nation      who would use the structures of government to establish their      particular religion as the official religion of the nation.      There are those who would use the legislative and judicial      processes to turn the social-moral agenda of their personal      sectarian commitment into the general law of the land. The      Senate Judiciary Committee has an obligation to serve as a      watchdog that sounds no uncertain warning when such a      philosophy seeks endorsement within the judiciary.        It is wrong to establish the identity of a person's      religion as a strategy for advancing     or defeating that person's nomination for a judgeship.      However, it is permissible, even obligatory, to inquire about      how a person's religion impacts that person's decisions about      upholding the constitution and evaluating legislation. When a      candidate for a federal bench has said, as did the candidate      under consideration last Wednesday, in an address in the town      in which I pastor, ``our political system seems to have lost      God'' and declares that the ``political system must remain      rooted in a Judeo-Christian perspective of the nature of      government and the nature of man,'' there is plenty for this      Committee to question.       Every candidate coming before this Committee should be      guaranteed confirmation or disqualification apart from the      candidate's religious identity as a Baptist, a Catholic, a      Buddhist or a person without religious identification. What      is important here is a candidate's pledge to defend the      constitution. And, that pledge should be buttressed by a      record of words and actions aimed not at attacking the very      religious pluralism that the candidate is being asked to      defend but rather to continuing a commitment to the highest      law of the land.       I felt grimy after listening to distinctions between a      ``good Catholic'' and ``bad Catholic.'' I know that language;      I heard it in the church of my childhood where we defined a      ``good Baptist'' as one who tithed to the church, didn't      smoke, didn't dance and attended church meetings on Sunday      evening and a ``bad Baptist'' as one who didn't fit that      profile. The distinctions had nothing to do with the essence      of the Christian tradition and the content of Baptist      principles. It is not a debate that is appropriate or      necessary in the Chamber of the United States Senate.       The United States is the most religiously pluralistic      nation on earth. The Interfaith Alliance speaks regularly in      commendation of ``One Nation--Many Faiths.'' For the sake of      the stability of this nation, the vitality of religion in      this nation, and the integrity of the Constitution, we have      to get this matter right. Yes, religion is important.      Discussions of religion are not out of place in the judiciary      committee or any public office. But evaluations of candidates      for public office on the basis of religion are wrong and      there should be no question that considerations of candidates      who would alter the political landscape of America by using      the judiciary to turn sectarian values into public laws      should end in rejection.       The crucial line of questioning should revolve not around      the issue of the candidate's personal religion but of the      candidate's support for this nation's vision of the role of      religion. If the door to the judiciary must have a sign      posted on it, let the sign read that those who would pursue      the development of a nation opposed to religion or committed      to a theocracy rather than a democracy need not apply.       In 1960, then presidential candidate John F. Kennedy      addressed the specific matter of Catholicism with surgical      precision and political wisdom, stating that the issue was      not what kind of church he believed in but what kind of      America he believed in. John F. Kennedy left no doubt about      that belief: ``I believe in an America where the separation      of church and state is absolute.'' Kennedy pledged to address      issues of conscience out of a focus on the national interest      not out of adherence to the dictates of one religion. He      confessed that if at any point a conflict arose between his      responsibility to defend the constitution and the dictates of      his religion, he would resign from public office. No less a      commitment to religious liberty should be acceptable by any      judicial nominee or by members of the Senate Judiciary      Committee who recommend for confirmation to the bench persons      charged with defending the Constitution.                                  ____       Statement of Rabbi Jack Moline, of the Interfaith Alliance                            (July 29, 2003)       I am Rabbi Jack Moline, Vice-chair at-large of The      Interfaith Alliance. I am also on the back end of a summer      cold, so please forgive the huskiness of my voice.       The father of our country, George Washington, was a      surveyor by trade. Part of his duties included the      determination of exactly where the property of one owner left      off and the other owner began. You might wonder what possible      difference a few inches, even a few feet in either direction      would make to a farmer with acres of land. But Washington      knew as we all know that crops do not grow only in the center      of a field, and that cattle do not graze only a distance from      the fence, and that injuries do not always occur close to the      barn. Good surveying produces good boundaries. And good      boundaries keep good neighbors from unnecessary conflict.       As a rabbi, I have studied similar boundary issues in the      Talmud. Entire sections are taken up discussing the      boundaries between properties, between businesses, between      Sabbath and weekdays, between the holy and the profane.      Violating those boundaries throws a system into turmoil.      Preserving them avoids unnecessary conflict.       We Americans have become experts in testing boundaries. You      can make your own list of the boundaries we have tried to      survey, and where we have been successful and where we have      not. In culture, in business, in public policy and in      politics, the lines that separate one domain from another      have been confronted by those who wish to preserve them and      by those who wish to redraw them.       When the Bill of Rights of our Constitution established      what Thomas Jefferson wisely called the wall of separation      between church and state, it created a two-hundred-year-old      tradition of surveying that boundary, trying to find the      exact place to keep good neighbors from unnecessary conflict.       The Senate Judiciary Committee failed in their latest      attempt last week when Alabama Attorney General William      Pryor, nominee for a Federal judgeship, was asked by a      supporting Senator about his religious affiliation. The      result, as you have seen, was an unnecessary conflict between      good neighbors. In fact, we are counting our blessings that      the Capitol Police were not called to intervene in the      ensuing arguments.       The religious beliefs of a nominee are relevant only to the      extent that they interfere with his or her ability to support      and defend the Constitution of the United States. Frankly, I      would be alarmed to see the influences of religious      conviction expunged from any aspect of American government.      And I think it is entirely relevant to ask any candidate for      the executive, legislative or judiciary if personal      convictions would interfere with the ability to support and      defend the Constitution and its resultant laws as they exist      today.       Frankly, that is the relevant quesion--not a question of      affiliation. Do the values, beliefs or proclivities that Mr.      Pryor or anybody else holds prevent him from meeting the      responsibilities of the office. The question is about his      beliefs and no one else's. By affixing a label to the      question and generalizing the issue, the legitimate business      of the Senate Judiciary Committee was catapulted onto the      other side of that carefully surveyed boundary. And lest you      think the fault lies only on one side, the subsequent      responses of opposing Senators are a good indication of the      reason we rely on articulated rules in our society and not      good will.       It is time to return to the tradition of Washington and      Jefferson and survey again that necessary boundary. And once      it has been reestablished, then it behooves both the Senators      and the nominees they examine to respect the values on which      this country was founded.                                  ____            Remarks of the Right Reverend Jane Holmes Dixon                            (July 29, 2003)       Good morning. It is a pleasure to be here with all of you      this morning. I am the Right Reverend Jane Holmes Dixon,      Immediate Past President of The Interfaith Alliance and the      recently retired Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of      Washington, Pro tempore.       Before I begin my remarks, I would like to thank Senator      Leahy for understanding the grave importance of why this      discussion today is not only crucial for the future of the      judicial nominations process, but in fact, a necessary      reflection on the state of our democracy for all of us      gathered here: religious leaders, elected officials, those      who seek to serve the nation by entering into civil service,      and finally, the countless people of this Nation who are      brought up to believe that any citizen, no matter what your      gender, race or religion, will have an equal opportunity to      serve this country, and will have the right to be treated      equally under the law. The First Amendment of our      Constitution--through its wise and steadfast guarantee that      the government of the United States shall make no law to      establish a religion and guarantees that it will not      interfere with the free exercise of religion--expects nothing      less than the religious freedom and liberty that this      provides.       I believe that I speak for many when I say that last week's      hearing of Alabama Attorney General Bill Pryor did not      reflect well on the religious health of our nation and the      guarantees of our Constitution.       Last week's hearing, a hearing that put on the record      certain Senators defining what is true Catholicism--including      even references to Rome--and other Senators having to defend      their opposition to a nominee against charges of being anti-     Catholic--was nothing short of a travesty and a major step      back for interfaith relations in this nation. This becomes      more troubling given the fact that there are indeed Roman      Catholics on this committee who, according to their own      remarks before the committee, consider themselves to be      devout.       Not only must those who are nominated to become judges      respect religious pluralism, equally important, those who are      charged with confirming judges must respect the fact that      within denominations there remains a wide spectrum of people      who all hold varied beliefs. And they are all equally worthy      of respect.       Senators do have an obligation to determine whether a      judicial nominee will in fact respect those of all religious      beliefs and those citizens amongst us who practice no      religion at all. It is fair to ascertain whether a nominee      will deliver justice based upon the Constitution of the      United States--a document that unites us all and binds us      together under a common law--or religious doctrine and sacred      texts that were written for those who specifically subscribe      to one religious tenet over another. This becomes more      necessary when a nominee or his or her supporters take the      unfortunate and even dangerous step of couching the nominee's      positions on law and justice in terms of abiding by one faith      tradition over another.       I am deeply disappointed that those charged with confirming      nominees to serve the federal judiciary and thus the millions      of Americans who will depend on those confirmed to uphold the      concept of blind justice,     would deploy the strategy of playing one religion against      another--equating honest differences of opinion with being      anti-religion. Whether it is anti-Catholic, anti-Baptist,      anti-Sikh, anti-Jew, or anti-Muslim, this kind of divisive      politics has no place in the Congress of the United States,      period. We are a people who are free to choose how and when      we worship.
