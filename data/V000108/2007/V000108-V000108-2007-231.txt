Quentin Smith for his many contributions to his community as an educator and civic leader, as well as to the entire country, as a member of the storied Tuskegee Airmen. His efforts as a veteran of the 99th Fighter Squadron, along with all of the Tuskegee Airmen, are worthy of the highest commendation.  For their efforts and their service, the surviving Tuskegee Airmen were recently recognized, though long overdue, with the Congressional Gold Medal in Washington, DC. These brave individuals had an overwhelming sense of patriotism and loyalty to their country. Unfortunately, these men, most of whom were college graduates or undergraduates, served at a time when they were not treated as equals. In a time when segregation existed in the military as well as in our communities, the Tuskegee Airmen, though not recognized at the time, are now rightfully remembered as one of the most successful units in our military's history, not only for their courage and sacrifice in the air, but for the role they played in the progress of the military and American society as a whole. It was not until 1948, when President Truman ordered the equal treatment and opportunity for all service members, that the significance of their efforts began to be realized. Though we as a nation continue to strive toward improving our society, the progress we have made is in large part due to the efforts of people like Quentin Smith and the Tuskegee Airmen.  Beyond his selfless service in the United States Military, I would be remiss if I did not speak of Mr. Smith's continued service to his community and the State of Indiana. As a civilian, Mr. Smith continued to serve his community as an educator, counselor, and principal at the elementary, middle, and high school levels, as well as Adjunct Professor at Indiana University, Northwestern University, Valparaiso University, and Calumet College of Saint Joseph. A highly regarded member of the educational community, Mr. Smith has served in many prestigious capacities, including: Chairman of the National Association of Secondary School Principals' Committee to Evaluate High Schools, President of the Gary Reading Council, and State Commissioner of Education, to name a few.  In addition, Mr. Smith has for years been a pillar of his community through his service as a member of many civic organizations. In fact, he has served as President of several organizations, such as: the Lake County Welfare Board, Gary Common Council, Lake County Community Development Committee, Gary/Chicago Airport Authority, Urban League of Northwest Indiana, and the Gary Human Relations Committee.  While he has recently been honored for his military service, Mr. Smith has been a recipient of many prestigious awards for his involvement in enriching the lives of his students and his community. These awards include: the Distinguished Hoosier award, presented by Governor Mitch Daniels, the coveted Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drum Major Award, presented by the Gary Frontiers Service Club, and the Teacher of the Year award, presented by the Delta Sigma Theta sorority. In addition, Mr. Smith is also a member of the City of Gary's Hall of Fame.  Madam Speaker, Quentin Smith has dedicated his life to bettering his community and his country. From his service as a member of the 99th Fighter Squadron to his service as an educator and public servant, he has been a true role model for all Americans. I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring Mr. Quentin Smith for his lifetime of loyalty, dedication, and service to his community and the entire country. For this, Quentin Smith is worthy of the highest admiration, and I am proud to represent him in Washington, DC.                          ____________________
