Speaker, it is with deep sadness and the utmost respect that I take this time to remember a dear friend and one of Indiana's most distinguished citizens, the Honorable Rudolph Clay, former Mayor of Gary, Indiana. On Tuesday, June 4, 2013, Rudy Clay passed away at the age of 77. Known for his many years of public service and his countless efforts toward improving the lives of Northwest Indiana residents, Rudy will be missed by his family, friends, constituents, and the many people whose lives he touched.   Rudolph Clay was born in Courtland, Alabama. He and his brother, David, were raised by their aunts, Daisy Washington and Mary Lucy Hunter, in Gary, Indiana, following the passing of his mother. Rudy graduated from Roosevelt High School in Gary before continuing his education at Indiana University in Bloomington, which he attended on a track scholarship. After returning to Gary, he met and fell in love with Christine Swan, whom he wed on November 30, 1957. From 1958 to 1960, Rudy began what would become a lifetime of public service by serving in the United States Army. During this time, Rudy's calling to fight injustice and to serve the public, especially those most in need, and his unwavering desire to be a catalyst for positive change, led him on his extraordinary journey.   Rudolph Clay was elected to the Indiana State Senate in 1972. While in this position, the focus of his efforts included working toward improved training programs for prison inmates and the creation of a victim's compensation fund. Following his service in the Indiana General Assembly, Rudy was elected to the Lake County Council in 1978 and re-elected in 1982. During his time on the Council, Rudy's dedication to equal rights impelled him to be an outspoken leader in the fight to eliminate unfair hiring practices in Lake County government. He was elected Lake County Recorder in 1984, and three years later, he was elected to the Lake County Board of Commissioners, a capacity in which he remained for four terms.   In 2005, Rudy became the first African American elected to serve as the Lake County Democratic Chairman, a position he held until 2009.   In 2006, recognizing the leadership Rudy Clay would bring to the people of Gary, the Gary Precinct Organization appointed him to be the next mayor of Gary, and he was elected to the position the following year. Mayor Clay was the epitome of a public servant. His energetic dedication to serving people and his profound compassion for them, especially those most in need, was limitless. Throughout his illustrious career, Rudy received many esteemed honors for his outstanding commitment and his constant efforts to improve thequality of life for the people of Gary and throughout Northwest Indiana.   While Rudy was fully committed to the improvement of Gary and Northwest Indiana, his greatest source of pride was always his family. He is survived by his devoted wife, Christine, and his beloved son, Rudy Jr. Rudy also leaves behind many other dear friends and family members, as well as a saddened but grateful community whose lives have been made better by having had Mayor Clay live amongst them.   Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in paying tribute to my dear friend, and a true public servant, Rudolph Clay. For his tremendous contributions to the people of Gary and all of Northwest Indiana, he has earned our admiration. Rudy Clay's unselfish and lifelong devotion to civil justice and to serving those most in need will be forever remembered. His legacy serves as an inspiration to us all.                          ____________________
