 President, I would like to take a moment to pay tribute to a friend of mine, Patricia Geadelmann. Pat serves as special assistant to the president for board and governmental relations at the University of Northern Iowa, my alma mater. Pat is retiring in January after more than 43 years at the university.  She began her career teaching physical education and health at the Malcolm Price Laboratory School and achieved the rank of professor. Since 1984, she has served in the UNI administration under four different presidents. In fact, in total, Pat has worked at UNI under 5 of the 10 presidents the university has had. Before that, she was an undergraduate student at the university.  Her experience and her knowledge of the University of Northern Iowa is unmatched. Needless to say, she has been an invaluable resource for each of the presidents she has served with and to the university as a whole. In fact, it is hard to imagine UNI without her. I have worked with Pat in her capacity as the head of government relations for the University of Northern Iowa for most of my time in the Senate. With someone who has her level of knowledge and experience, you would be tempted to wonder whether she reports to the president or the president reports to her. But, if you know her, you know she is as unassuming as she is dogged in her dedication to the university's best interests.  The University of Northern Iowa was lucky to have her, and on behalf of the UNI family, we are sorry to lose her. We wish her well in her new ``retired'' career as minister of care and visitation at First Presbyterian Church in Waterloo.                          ____________________
