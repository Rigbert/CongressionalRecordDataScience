 President, I am pleased the managers of the bill will accept my amendment to the foreign operations appropriations bill. My amendment will apply the same standards for sanctions on countries that harbor Rwandan indicted war criminals as are applied to countries that provide sanctuary for individuals indicted by the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal.  As the bill is currently written, with the exception of certain types of humanitarian assistance, no foreign aid can be given to any country that provides sanctuary to individuals indicted by the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal. But for those individuals indicted by the Rwandan war crimes tribunal, the bill contains only a discretionary authority to withhold aid.  Mr. President, the United States was a cosponsor of the U.N. Security Council resolution which authorized the establishment of the Rwandan war crimes tribunal. Accountability for the 500,000 people killed in the 1994 genocide is an integral part of any effort for reconciliation and reconstruction in Rwanda, much like the Truth Commission in South Africa.  Mr. President, my amendment is not without precedent. The foreign operations bill 2 years ago restricted foreign assistance to countries that harbored both Rwandan and Yugoslav indicted war criminals. I believe this was the right standard, and to do anything less sends the wrong message on war crimes. If we say we are against war crimes in Yugoslavia, we should also equally say we are against war crimes in Rwanda. I don't believe that there's one Senator who doesn't share this belief--but it is important that we say so.  My amendment makes a strong statement of support for the Rwandan tribunal and for the cause of human rights in Africa.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is my understanding that these have been approved by the Democrats.
