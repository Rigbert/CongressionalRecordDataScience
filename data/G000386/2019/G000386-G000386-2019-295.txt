 President, before the Presidents Day recess, I announced that I would introduce legislation if the tax extenders weren't included in the legislation that we passed at that time that would keep government open.  Today I am following through on that promise with a bill that I am introducing with Finance Committee ranking member Senator Wyden of Oregon.  It is fitting that I am taking this step in the same month as Groundhog Day, as the subject of my remarks is something that Congress has had to deal with too many times already.  Next to me is a depiction from the movie ``Groundhog Day,'' which is about a man named Phil who must relive the same day over and over until he gets everything right. While we still need to break the cycle of repetitive short-term extensions, the right thing to do right now is to extend these already-expired provisions for 2018 and 2019.  As I have said before, the tax extenders are a collection of temporary taxincentives that have required extension on a very regular basis in order to keep them available to the taxpayers. Currently, there are 26 provisions. At one time there were as many as 50-some. We have done away with some of them and made some of those laws permanent, but these 26 provisions expired at the end of 2017. They need to be extended, as well as three others that expired at the end of last year.  Today we are in the middle of filing season for 2018 tax returns, and taxpayers affected by these expired provisions need a resolution so that they can file. I want to stress that I want to find a long-term resolution so that we don't have to have temporary tax policy, but it is critical we make it clear to the taxpayers that these provisions are available for the 2018 filing season and extending them for this year will give us room to take a needed long-term view of this temporary tax policy.  Many of the tax extenders are intended to be incentives, and to be successful, then, these incentives need to be in effect before decisions can be made. That is why we should provide extensions for at least 2 years, to maximize that incentive effect. But it is also important that we extend these provisions for 2018, even though the year has obviously already ended. We have developed a very bad policy and a very bad habit of extending these tax provisions year after year, and people and businesses have come to expect that the extension will happen.  As a result, decisions were made by various businesses in 2018 based upon the expectation of extension, and that is a reasonable expectation because we have done it over decades. In other words, people did what we wanted them to do in their business decisions when these provisions were created. We should not retroactively punish these businesspeople for Congress's inaction.  Today, a diverse group of organizations, including the National Biodiesel Board, the American Trucking Associations, and the National Corn Growers Association, among others, sent a letter to congressional leaders requesting that the expired provisions be extended through 2019 as quickly as possible. I want to quote a few sentences from that letter:       Providing taxpayers with a predictable planning outlook as      it pertains to tax rules is conducive to increased private      sector investment and economic activity. Accordingly, we      respectfully ask that you act to retroactively extend these      expired tax provisions through 2019 on the first appropriate      legislative vehicle.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the complete letter be printed in the Record.       There being no objection, the material was ordered to be      printed in the Record, as follows:                                                February 28, 2019.     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,     Speaker of the U.S. House,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      U.S. House Republican Leader,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate Majority Leader,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles Schumer,      U.S. Senate Democratic Leader,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Richard Neal,     Chairman, U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Kevin Brady,     Ranking Republican Member, U.S. House Committee on Ways and          Means,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Chairman, U.S. Senate Finance Committee,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     Ranking Democratic Member, U.S. Senate Finance Committee,     Washington, DC.       Dear Speaker Pelosi, Republican Leader McCarthy, Majority      Leader McConnell, Democratic Leader Schumer, Chairman Neal,      Ranking Member Brady, Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member      Wyden: The following organizations, representing diverse      business, energy, transportation, real estate and agriculture      sectors, are writing to you regarding the pressing need to      address the expired tax provisions (``tax extenders''). We      respectfully ask that at a minimum, the House and Senate      retroactively extend these provisions through 2019 promptly      in order to minimize potentially severe disruptions to the      recently opened tax filing season.       These temporary tax provisions have remained lapsed since      the end of 2017. This has created confusion for the numerous      industry sectors that utilize these tax incentives and has      threatened thousands of jobs in the U.S. economy. The      continued uncertainty with regard to eventual congressional      action on tax extenders is undermining the effectiveness of      these incentives and stands as a needless barrier to      additional job creation and economic growth in the private      sector.       Providing taxpayers with a predictable planning outlook as      it pertains to tax rules is conducive to increased private      sector investment and economic activity. Accordingly, we      respectfully ask that you act to retroactively extend these      expired tax provisions through 2019 on the first appropriate      legislative vehicle.       We sincerely appreciate your attention to this matter, and      stand ready to work with you to achieve this important      objective.
