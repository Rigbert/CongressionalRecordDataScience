Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  H.R. 3786, as amended, will direct the General Services Administration, on behalf of the National Archives, to convey property in Alaska to the city of Anchorage.  I am pleased to be the sponsor of this legislation, which will bring savings to the taxpayer.  The National Archives has determined that it no longer needs the property to be conveyed in the bill, and it wants to sell it as part of its efforts to shrink its space footprint. The bill will require fair market value for the property and will allow the National Archives to retain the proceeds to offset the costs of repairing other facilities. I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this legislation.  I reserve the balance of my time.
