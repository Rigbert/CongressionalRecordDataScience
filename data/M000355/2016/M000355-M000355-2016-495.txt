 President, the Democratic leader, who has been leading a partisan filibuster of anti-Zika funding for over a week, said this about anti-Zika funding yesterday:       There's no excuse for inaction and partisanship. We can't      afford to waste another day, a week, another month.  Maybe Democrats are finally ready to end their partisan attack on women's health. I certainly hope so, and, as I have said many times, they will have that opportunity soon.                          ____________________
