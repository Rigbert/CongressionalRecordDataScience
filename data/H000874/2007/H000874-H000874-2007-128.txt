 And I say to him that we had discussions on that today with Chairman Rangel and we are going to try to move Trade Assistance Adjustment to provide for any dislocations that might occur that Members are concerned about. And I'm hopeful that we can move as well the Peru FTA hopefully by the end of the month, but in no event later than November 16. So it is very much my hope between now and then. But we will certainly pass at least the Peru FTA along with the Trade Assistance Adjustment.  I will say to my friend that Panama is another bill that I think might be possible; however, the gentleman knows there is a problem that has arisen unrelated to the provisions of the trade bill but which are of great concern to many Members on both sides of the aisle.
