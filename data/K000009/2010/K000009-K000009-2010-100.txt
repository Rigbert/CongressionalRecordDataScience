 Since his appointment in December of 2005, he has worked tirelessly to strengthen ties between our two countries. As a co-chair of the Congressional Ukrainian Caucus, I have had the distinct pleasure of working closely with the Ambassador.  Ambassador Shamshur was integral in the re-establishment of normal trade relations between our countries and the signing of the Trade and Investment Cooperation Agreement. With his help the United States and Ukraine signed an Agreement on Strategic Cooperation in December 2008, which has fostered democratic growth, transparency, and freedom in Ukraine. In addition, it has established goals to cooperate on concrete issues such as military, energy, and scientific cooperation. During the Ambassador's tenure great steps were taken to strengthen Ukraine's energy security and ensure its progress towards European integration.  Ambassador Shamshur worked with the Ukrainian-American community to ensure that the victims of the 1932-33 famine-genocide were given the honor they deserve. He understands that history demands truth. Properly securing a nation's past positions it forward to the future--an important undertaking often undervalued by diplomats and leaders. In addition, he has taken steps to grow Ukrainian-American exchange programs in order to promote democratic values and strengthen the bond between our two nations.  We wish him, his wife Tetiana, and his daughter Tetiana all the best as their journey continues. I know Dr. Shamshur will continue to help Ukraine achieve the democratic freedoms she has fought for since achieving her independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. He is a wonderful representative of Ukraine and her people, a good friend, and a true statesman. Thank you, Ambassador Shamshur, for your service.                          ____________________
