  I spoke several days ago here on the floor of the Senate at great length about what this budget proposal would do, the budget resolution that is before the Senate, and how reckless it is. It ignores the cost of war, it ignores the cost of the aftermath in Iraq, and it underfunds critical priorities here at home such as homeland security, education, and transportation.  But I am appalled that there is something else buried in this massive budget that needs to be removed.
