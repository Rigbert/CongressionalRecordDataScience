President.  Mr. President, I believe it is very clear that the tobacco industry and their allies will pull out all of the stops to kill legislation that protects our children. It is very clear how the tobacco industry hopes to bring about this legislation's demise. The tobacco lobbyists want to produce a death by distraction. It is very easy to see why the tobacco lobbyists are pursuing this strategy. They cannot derail our cause of protecting children from starting to smoke on the merits. The case for passing legislation to protect our kids is too powerful. It is too strong. It is too moral.  So the tobacco lobby hopes to throw everything but the proverbial kitchen sink into this debate, hope that it doesn't stink the place up too much, and then hope that the American people lose sight of what this is really all about. But the fact is that the American people get it. They know that this is about protecting children. They are not going to fall for this strategy of trying to produce enough distraction that somehow the Senate will have to move on to other issues or somehow some other question will have to be addressed on this floor. I believe that allowing this bill to die by all of these distractions would be one of the most shocking abdications of our public responsibilities that has been seen in years.  If this body stays focused on the goal of protecting children, works through the relevant amendments, and passes this important legislation, this Congress would have a lasting legacy of accomplishment in the cause of keeping our children healthy in the 21st century.  There are a variety of legitimate issues that have come up in this debate. The question of education policy,of income taxes, a whole host of questions.  I happen to agree with a number of our colleagues on the other side who want to make it tough, for example, to raise taxes. I am one of the Democrats who voted to do that. But this is not the proper bill on which to have a debate about tax policy. This is not the proper vehicle to have a comprehensive discussion about tax reform. This is about tobacco.  I see our friend and colleague, Senator Ford. He and I serve on the Commerce Committee. We produced a bill that came out of committee by 19 to 1 because we stayed focused on the relevant issues. We didn't always agree.  I have enormous respect for Senator Ford. He has done yeoman's work on the question of making sure our farmers get a fair shake. He knows I feel strongly on key issues: for example, making sure that these tobacco companies don't pay for a settlement in this country by targeting youngsters around the globe. But together, and with our colleague, Senator Hollings of South Carolina, we produced what we think is a fair package. There can be further discussion of those issues. But we stayed focused on the question of tobacco. We didn't raise a whole host of other issues that are important to both of us. We stayed focused on the cause of trying to protect children, recognizing that we would have further discussion of that subject here on the floor. But we stayed focused on the topic at hand.  The fight to stop the cigarette industry from marketing to children did not begin this year. But this is the year we have an opportunity to make real progress. I was a Member of the other body and participated in the hearings held by then-Chairman Henry Waxman. The tobacco executives told me under oath that nicotine isn't addictive. The American people didn't believe them. The Surgeon General of the last 20 years didn't believe them. As a result of that hearing, and the documents that have come out over these many years, we have been in a position to make great progress--progress, for example, that lead to that 19-to-1 vote in the Senate Commerce Committee.  So this debate is the culmination of years of work by those who have been trying to promote the cause of better health for the children in our Nation. We are trying to do it in a way that is going to help kids around the world be healthier. For the first time, we are going to say that you have to protect kids in Oregon and in Texas, and across this country. But we are going to get the Government out of the business of trying to help these tobacco companies sell cigarettes overseas to hook kids in Bangkok and Bangladesh.  That is important. But we are up against tremendous lobbying. The tobacco companies have spent millions. Maybe what we need is a ``Million Child March'' on Washington, DC, with families, with health professionals, to show that we are not going to be derailed by these lobbyists. These lobbyists are not going to be allowed to derail the cause of public health in this body. We are going to come back again and again and again in the days ahead.  So this issue is focused on what really counts; that is, protecting children. There is not going to be a death by distraction. There is not going to be a precipitous and unfortunate demise for this bill by virtue of so many other issues coming up and being debated on this floor. We are going to stay focused.  Mr. President, I know of the good work that you have done on this issue. We have fought together on a bipartisan basis to try to protect children in our State. I am looking forward to seeing the kind of spirit that you and I have brought to this issue come to this body as a whole to make sure that we stay focused on the issue of protecting children.  I yield my time, Mr. President.                          ____________________
