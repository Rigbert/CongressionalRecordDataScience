President, I looked out the window. One of my neighbors usually parks a car on the street. I thought it had been stolen until I saw about an inch and a half of antenna sticking out and realized the car was under that.  I know the area where my friend from Vermont lives, one of the most beautiful ones. He at least got his roof shoveled off. We had a little trouble with the roof on my house, I might say, and have had a bit of damage. We have had a lot of snow back home.  I would note that, while the Congress might close down the Government, we would have reopened it, but we found out there was a much higher power, as I am sure the Chaplain would agree, that closed the Government right down again. I hope it will be back open. I know there are so many thousands of good, hard-working men and women who want to get back to work.
