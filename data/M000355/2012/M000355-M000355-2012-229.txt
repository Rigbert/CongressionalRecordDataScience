 President, today I wish to honor the Pikeville Medical Center for its continued commitment to providing superior medical care to the people of Kentucky. Pikeville Medical Center has been named National Hospital of the Year, making it the only repeat winner of this prestigious award. The 261-room hospital has over 2,000 employees, including more than 270 physicians and residents, and its superior facilities, equipment, and staff have drawn in qualified medical professionals from around the country.  In January 2011, Pikeville Medical Center became affiliated with Cleveland Clinic's Heart Surgery Program, which has been ranked number one among heart programs in the United States for 16 years. This recent affiliation has allowed PMC to provide cutting-edge technology and treatments to its patients.  Prior to receiving this award, Pikeville Medical Center was named 12th in the Nation of Top 100 Best Places to Work by Modern Healthcare Magazine and first on the Best Places to Work in Kentucky list by the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce. Individual units of the Medical Center have also received recognition. The Heart Institute is one of the first 10 hospitals in the United States and the first in Kentucky to reach the highest distinction awarded by the Society of Chest Pain Centers, and the Stroke Center is one of 10 Kentucky recipients of the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association's Get with the Guidelines--Stroke Gold Plus Quality Achievement Award. Along with this, the Leonard Lawson Cancer Center was awarded the ``Outstanding Achievement Award'' 2 years in a row.  While the Pikeville Medical Center has much to be proud of, it continues to strive for excellence. The hospital recently completed a $10-million emergency department expansion and renovation, and is currently undergoing a $100-million construction project to provide new offices and outpatient surgery units. This is all part of the organization's mission to ``provide quality regional health care in a Christian environment.''  Mr. President, I would like to ask at this time for my colleagues in the Senate to join me in recognizing the Pikeville Medical Center. There was recently an article published in eastern Kentucky's local periodical magazine, the Sentinel-Echo: Silver Edition, highlighting the center's many successes. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record said article.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          [From the Sentinel-Echo: Silver Edition, Nov. 2011]                        Pikeville Medical Center       Pikeville Medical Center, now affiliated with Cleveland      Clinic Heart Surgery, is the nation's only repeat winner of      the National Hospital of the Year. President and Chief      Executive Officer Walter E. May has always encouraged PMC      employees to dream big and big things will happen. After      winning the award, he aid, ``It doesn't get much bigger than      this. This is like winning the Super Bowl, the NCAA Final      Four or the World Series for a hospital.''       As a true leader and innovator in the health care industry,      Pikeville Medical Center continues to raise the bar of      excellence. Currently employing more than 2,000 people, PMC      has hired over 550 employees just during the past year. PMC      is a 261-bed facility, and a $100 million construction      project is under way, producing 1,500 temporary jobs and 100      permanent jobs. The new medical office building will house      nine floors of office and clinical space for outpatient      surgery, exam rooms and primary and specialty care      physicians, and the enclosed parking garage will have space      for more than 1,000 cars.       The combination of first class facilities, the best      equipment available and a highly motivated support staff has      enabled Pikeville Medical Center to recruit some of the      nation's most qualified physicians. More than 270      credentialed professionals--physicians and residents--are      authorized to practice medicine at Pikeville Medical Center,      and the number continues to grow. Over the past year we have      recruited over 30 physicians and added six new services.      Among the newer service lines are: gynecological oncology,      otolaryngology, rheumatology, pediatric endocrinology, hand      surgery and nephrology.                          The Heart Institute       According to the American Heart Association, heart disease      is the #1 killer of Americans, making heart health a top      priority for Pikeville Medical Center. In January 2011,      Walter E. May addressed a standing room only crowd during a      special called press conference and announced Pikeville      Medical Center is now affiliated with Cleveland Clinic's      Heart Surgery Program.       The Cleveland Clinic heart program has been ranked #1 in      the nation for the last 16 years by U.S. News and World      Report. The affiliation has enhanced PMC's opportunities to      provide new treatments and therapies to patients and has      accelerated Pikeville Medical and Cleveland Clinic's mutual      accomplishments in leading cardiac surgery care. Currently,      PMC staff is attending training at Cleveland Clinic and      enhancing their abilities to deal with complex medical      situations, while utilizing new technologies and innovations,      The two facilities are also sharing surgical outcome data and      research.       In addition to the affiliation with Cleveland Clinic's      heart surgery program, PMC continues to make great strides in      heart care:       One of the first 10 hospitals in the nation and the first      hospital in Kentucky to be designated a Level III Accredited      Chest Pain Center, the highest distinction given by the      Society of Chest Pain Centers       THe cath lab has celebrated the 10th anniversary of the      first cath procedure performed at PMC.       Median ``door-to-balloon'' time averages around 65 minutes      (well below the standard of 90 minutes set by the American      Heart Association and the Joint Commission).       The heart team is comprised of Cardiologists,      Interventional Cardiologists, Cardiothoracic and Vascular      Surgeons and an Electrophysiologist. PMC's Heart Institute      operates offices throughout the region in Pike, Mingo and      Johnson Counties.                             Stroke Center       Pikeville Medical Center has received the American Heart      Association/American Stroke Association's Get With The      Guidelines'-Stroke (GWTG-Stroke) Gold Plus Quality      Achievement Award. Only 10 hospitals in KY have earned this      accreditation, and no other KY hospital east of Lexington has      earned this prestigious distinction.       The award recognizes PMC's commitment and success in      implementing excellent care     for stroke patients, according to evidence-based guidelines.      To receive the award, PMC achieved 85 percent or higher      adherence to all GWTG-Stroke Quality Achievement indicators      for two or more consecutive 12-month intervals and achieved      75 percent or higher compliance with six of 10 GWTG-Stroke      Quality Measures, which are reporting initiatives to measure      quality of care.       ``With a stroke, time lost is brain lost, and the Get With      the Guidelines-Stroke Gold Plus Quality Achievement Award      demonstrates PMC's commitment to being one of the top      hospitals in the country for providing aggressive, proven      stroke care,'' said Dr. Naveed Ahmed, Medical Director of      Pikeville Medical Center's Stroke Unit. ``We will continue to      provide care shown in scientific literature to quickly and      efficiently treat stroke patients with evidence-based      protocols.''                      Leonard Lawson Cancer Center       Once again, Pikeville Medical Center's Leonard Lawson      Cancer Center received the ``Outstanding Achievement Award''      from the Commission on Cancer of the American College of      Surgeons. PMC is one of only three hospitals in the state of      Kentucky to ever achieve this award, and is the only hospital      in Kentucky to be honored twice and consecutively.       PMC has been recognized by the Commission on Cancer of the      American College of Surgeons for offering: The full scope of      multi-disciplinary services required to screen, diagnose,      treat, rehabilitate and support patients with cancer and      their families; A high quality, comprehensive team approach      by cancer care professionals; Complete range of state-of-the      art services and equipment; Access to information about new      treatment options and ongoing cancer trials; Access to      prevention and early detection programs, cancer education and      supportive services.       The cancer center has also instituted program enhancements      and improvements including opening a new Paintsville Oncology      Clinic, offering genetics counseling and opening a      gynecological oncology service.       ``The Cancer Center at Pikeville Medical Center is not just      a group of employees, they are a team. They continually      strive to provide excellent quality care. One of their goals      is to provide a special kind of friendship along the way. A      friendship that starts with a disease as serious and      devastating as cancer and evolves, during their time at PMC,      into a special relationship we refer to as the PMC family,''      said Roxanne Hale. Director of the Cancer Center.                          Emergency Department       In preparation for achieving Level II Trauma Center      certification, Pikeville Medical Center has completed a $10      million emergency department expansion and renovation. This      new facility encompasses nearly 23,000 square feet, includes      two trauma bays, three triage bays, provides physiological      monitoring and a 32 flat screen tv in every room and has CT      scanning and digital x-ray on-site.       Over the past year, PMC's ED patient satisfaction scores      have reached nearly 100%, and while the new facility is      impressive, it's PMC's employees who make this recognition      possible.                  The Journey of Excellence Continues       Pikeville Medical Center's employees are guided by the      mission statement ``to provide quality regional health care      in a Christian environment.'' ``This is more than just a      slogan,'' said Chief Operating Officer Juanita Deskins, ``it      is a prescription for the work lives of our employees.'' It      is primarily because of this work ethic that PMC regularly      receives recognition and awards, such as: 12th in the nation      of the top 100 Best Places to Work by Modern Healthcare      Magazine (the second year in a row PMC made the top 100      list); the number one hospital in the state on the Best      Places to Work in Kentucky list, compiled by the KY Chamber      of Commerce; three employed physicians listed among the      nation's Best Doctors; for the third consecutive year PMC'      has been selected as a Hospital of Choice; Patient      Satisfaction Award from the Pike County School District      Superintendent; the prestigious Excellence Award from the      Kentucky Center for Performance Excellence, following the      strict criteria set forth by the nationally-acclaimed Malcolm      Baldrige Award; the Insight Award fur outstanding service in      Inpatient Oncology and Inpatient Rehabilitation; the gold      seal of approval from the Joint Commission for Primary Stroke      Centers.       While those accolades are impressive, Pikeville Medical      Center will not rest on its laurels. There is always room for      improvement and our institutional vision has not yet been      fully realized--our journey is not over.       Pikeville Medical Center will continue to improve and grow,      and will always pursue excellence. Technology will evolve and      we will continue to recruit the country's best doctors and      add specialty services to assure the best health care      possible for our patients. In the words of Walter E. May,      ``We aren't trying to provide health care that's `as good as'      anyplace else . . . we're working to provide health care      that's better than these patients could get anywhere else. At      Pikeville Medical Center, we're proud to say . . . we're      still the one!''                          ____________________
