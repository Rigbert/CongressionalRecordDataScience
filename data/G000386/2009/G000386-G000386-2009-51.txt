 President, I had a chance to listen to my good friend, the Senator from Illinois; his remarks about why the bill before the Senate is going to reduce costs and pay down on the national debt. Now, that is the Senator from Illinois. I am the Senator from Iowa. But I would like to not refer to my judgment about this bill right now. What I would like to refer to is the judgment outlined in a report that was issued today from the Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in the Department of Health and Human Services, a professional person who calls it like it is. That is his responsibility.  Remember, I am quoting from a report that was just given today about this 2,074-page bill we have before us, and that my friend from Illinois was just speaking very favorably about. So I am going to talk about somebody in the executive branch of government, under the President of the United States, who says this about this reform bill--that it will cost more than the status quo. The Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued a report on Senator Reid's bill which shows that health care costs would go up, not down, under his bill. The Chief Actuary warned that the Democrats' health care bill would increase health care costs, threaten access to care for seniors, and force people off their current coverage.  In other words, the administration's own Chief Actuary conclusively demonstrates that the Democrats' rhetoric does not match the reality of the bill. The cost curve would bend up, not down. National health expenditures would increase from 16 percent of GDP to 20.9 percent under the Reid bill. The Chief Actuary concluded that the Federal Government and the country would spend $234 billion more under the bill than without it. The Chief Actuary also says that the bill ``jeopardizes access to care for beneficiaries'' because of the bill's severe cuts in Medicare.  Quoting the Chief Actuary:       Providers for whom Medicare constitutes a substantive      portion of their business could find it difficult to remain      profitable and . . . might end their participation in the      program (possibly jeopardizing access to care for      beneficiaries).  Then it speaks about the savings in the bill being unrealistic. The Actuary says that many of the Medicare cuts ``are unrelated to the providers' costs of furnishing services to beneficiaries.'' It is therefore ``doubtful'' that providers could reduce costs to keep up with the cuts.  Then the Chief Actuary speaks about new taxes costing consumers $11 billion per year. The new taxes in the Reid bill would increase drug and device prices and health insurance premiums for consumers. The Actuary estimates this would increase costs on consumers by $11 billion per year, beginning in 2011--that is 3 years before most benefits kick in.  Then the Actuary speaks about health care shortages, that these health care shortages are ``plausible and even probable,'' particularly for Medicare and Medicare beneficiaries. Because of the increased demand for health care, the Actuary says that access-to-care problems--again these words ``plausible'' and even ``probable'' under the Reid bill. The access problems will be the worst for seniors on Medicare and low-income people on Medicaid. The Actuary says ``providers might tend to accept more patients who have private insurance with relatively attractive payment rates and fewer Medicare and Medicaid patients, exacerbating existing access problems for the latter group.''  Premiums for the government-run plan would actually be higher than under private plans. Agreeing with the Congressional Budget Office, the Chief Actuary said that because the government plan would not encourage highervalue health care and it would attract sicker people, premiums for the government-run plan would be 4 percent higher than for the private insurers.  Then there is a point about employers dropping coverage. The Chief Actuary concluded that 17 million people will lose their employer-sponsored coverage. Many smaller employers would be ``inclined to terminate their existing coverage'' so their workers could qualify for ``heavily subsidized coverage'' through the exchange.  Then it speaks, lastly, about the long-term health care part of this bill called the CLASS Act. The CLASS Act stands for Community Living Assistance Services and Support, C-L-A-S-S.  The Chief Actuary has determined that the CLASS Act long-term care insurance program faces ``a significant risk of failure'' because the high costs will attract sicker people and lead to low participation. Even though premiums would be $240 a month, the policy would result in ``a net Federal cost in the long term.''  I think quoting the Chief Actuary is a very good way to bring attention to the shortcomings that, on this side of the aisle, we have tried to discuss about the 2,074-page bill. Members on this side of the aisle have shown that the Reid bill will bend the health spending curve the wrong way over the next year and that the Reid bill cuts Medicare by $\1/2\ trillion and jeopardizes seniors' access to care. So, again, quoting from the Health and Human Services Chief Actuary's analysis confirms the dangerous consequences of the 2,074-page Reid bill.  I would like to highlight some of the findings in a more encompassing way than I just did, quoting the Chief Actuary.  First, contrary to what Members on the other side of the aisle claim, the Chief Actuary's report confirms that the Reid bill bends the cost curve the wrong way. According to the HHS Chief Actuary, over the next 10 years--and this chart highlights it--``total national health expenditures under this bill would increase by an estimated total of $234 billion.'' And a good portion of the increase in national health expenditures would be caused by the so-called fees in this bill on medical devices and on prescription drugs and on health insurance premiums.  Here we have a chart where the Chief Actuary found that ``. . . fees would . . . be passed through to health consumers in the form of higher drug and device prices and higher insurance premiums . . .'' This would result in ``. . . an associated increase of approximately $11 billion per year in overall national health expenditures.'' This refutes claims from the other side that the so-called fees won't be passed on to consumers. And this analysis clearly refutes claims from the other side that the Reid bill saves money.  Next, the Chief Actuary also confirms that the Reid bill jeopardizes beneficiary access to care. The Chief Actuary tallied up around $493 billion in net Medicare cuts, and he raised concerns in particular about two categories of these Medicare cuts.  First, the report warns about the permanent productivity adjustments to annual payment updates. These productivity adjustments ``automatically cut annual Medicare payment updates based on productivity measures for the entire economy,'' not just for that section of health care part of the economy.  The Chief Actuary confirms that these permanent cuts would threaten access to care. Referring to these cuts, he wrote that ``. . . the estimated savings . . . may be unrealistic'' and ``. . . possibly jeopardizing access to care for beneficiaries.''  ``It is doubtful that many could improve their own productivity to the end achieved by the economy at large.'' This is a direct quote from the Chief Actuary's report. He goes on to say, ``We are not aware of any empirical evidence demonstrating the medical community's ability to achieve productivity improvements equal to those of the overall economy.''  In other words, basically he is saying this: If you are going to make a judgment that you are going to cut health care costs and that productivity has to be measured by the entire economy, you can't take the entire economy and apply it to a small segment of the economy--health care--and expect it to be fair and expect that small segment of the economy to be as productive and equal the productivity of the entire U.S. economy.  You have to listen to these people who are professionals in these areas. The Chief Actuary is a professional. In fact, the Chief Actuary's conclusion is that it would be difficult for providers to even remain profitable over time, as Medicare payments fail to keep up with the cost of caring for beneficiaries.  Referring to this chart, ultimately, here is the Chief Actuary's conclusion: that providers who rely on Medicare might end their participation in Medicare, ``. . . possibly jeopardizing access to care for beneficiaries.'' That is right out of the Chief Actuary's report, is where that quote comes from.  He even has numbers to back up these statements. His office ran simulations of the effect of these drastic and permanent cuts. Here we have the quote. Based on the simulations, the Chief Actuary found that during the first 10 years, ``. . . 20 percent of Medicare Part A providers would become unprofitable . . . as a result of productivity adjustments.  This is going to be horrible on rural America where we already have difficult times recruiting doctors and keeping our hospitals open. As I said, it is difficult to keep up with these productivity adjustments by our providers. It is for this reason that the Actuary found that ``reductions in payment updates . . . based on economy-wide productivity gains, are unlikely to be sustainable on a permanent annual basis.'' That is right out of the report of the Actuary.  The second category of Medicare cuts the Chief Actuary raises concerns about would be imposed by the new independent Medicare advisory board created in this 2,074-page bill. This new body of unelected officials would have broad authority to make even further cuts in Medicare. These additional cuts in Medicare would be driven by arbitrary cost growth targets based on a blend of general economic growth and medical inflation. This board would have the authority to impose further automatic Medicare cuts, even absent any congressional action.  The Chief Actuary gives a reality check to this proposal. He shows how tall an order the Reid bill's target for health care cost growth actually is.  Again quoting the Actuary:       Limiting cost growth to a level below medical price      inflation would represent an exceedingly difficult challenge.  He points out in this analysis that Medicare cost growth was below this target in only 4 of the last 25 years. Just think--what this 2,074-page bill is trying to accomplish is something that has been accomplished in only 4 out of the last 25 years.  The Actuary also points out that the backroom deals that carved out certain types of providers would complicate this board's effort to cut Medicare. So, to this analysis:       The necessary savings would have to be achieved primarily      through changes affecting physician services, Medicare      Advantage payments, and Part D.  So providers, such as hospitals, will escape from this board's cut at the expense of doctors, Medicare Advantage plans, and higher premiums imposed on beneficiaries for their Medicare drug coverage, Part D of Medicare. If we survey the Nation's seniors, I doubt very much they would say that raising their premiums for Medicare drug coverage is what they would call health care reform.  This board, which can cut reimbursements, is guaranteed to have to impose these additional Medicare cuts. In other words, they can do it.  According to the Chief Actuary's analysis of the Medicare cuts in the Reid bill, even though the Medicare cuts already in the Reid bill are ``quite substantial,'' they would--the savings ``would not be sufficient to meet the growth rate targets.'' This means the board will be required by law to impose even more Medicare cuts, in addition to the massive Medicare cuts already in the bill.  This bill imposes a $2\1/2\ trillion tab on Americans. It kills jobs with taxes and fees that go into effect 4 years before the reforms kick in.  It kills jobs with an employer mandate. It imposes $\1/2\ trillion in higher taxes on premiums, on medical devices, on prescription drugs and more. It jeopardizes access to care with massiveMedicare cuts. It imposes higher costs. It raises premiums. It bends the growth curve the wrong way; in other words, up instead of down. This is not what people have in mind when they think about health care reform.  There is another aspect to this bill that I wish to go over. I hope the third time is the charm. I hope this time the other side of the aisle will understand that the Reid bill increases taxes on middle-income families, individuals, and single parents. That is because contrary to the claims made by the other side of the aisle, the Reid bill clearly raises taxes on middle-income Americans. We have data, not from this Senator, but as I quoted previously the expertise of the Chief Actuary, I want to quote the expertise now of the Joint Committee on Taxation, professionals who are blind to politics, who judge things and call them like they see them. Yesterday I pointed out how the same Joint Committee on Taxation data led my Democratic friends to proclaim that the Reid bill provided a net tax cut to all Americans. We have this distribution chart I used previously to show that that net really is not net.  There is no question that the bill does provide a tax benefit to a group of Americans, a relatively small group. A much larger group, however, will see their taxes go up. Most, if not all in this group, will not benefit from the government subsidy for health insurance. That is part of this 2,074-page bill. As a result, the generous subsidy that is in that bill that is going to a small group of Americans cannot be used by this larger group to offset their increased tax liabilities. The other side, however, wants to spread the large tax benefit that is going to this small group of Americans to everybody; in other words, all Americans, even among those Americans who are not eligible to receive the subsidy, and then somehow claim that all Americans are receiving a tax cut. How can a person receive a tax cut if they are not receiving some type of tax benefit?  Yes, the data shows that some will receive a benefit, but the data also shows that the others will see a tax increase. I have highlighted in yellow these various figures, individuals and families who will see a tax increase. In general, these individuals and families are not receiving the subsidy for health insurance. This means they have no government benefit to offset their new tax liability. The most important point I want to make--for the third time--is that these tax increases fall on individuals making more than $50,000 and families making more than $75,000. Again, I highlighted this group on the Joint Committee on Taxation chart.  The Joint Committee distributed in this chart three separate tax provisions: the high-cost plan tax, the medical expense deduction limitation, and the Medicare payroll tax. Among these tax provisions, the high-cost plan tax seems to be garnering the most attention and also tremendous opposition. I don't have to explain who the opponents of this tax increase are. Everybody knows. In fact, yesterday I had representatives of the Iowa Education Association, the teachers of Iowa, saying they are against that high plan tax because it is going to hurt Iowa teachers. So if this provision, the high-cost plan tax, were to drop out of the Reid bill for one reason or another--and this bill is still being written in secret or at least changes in this 2,074-page bill are being written in secret so who knows what is going to happen to this highly controversial thing--if it is taken out, some Members may feel they have successfully shielded the middle class from a tax increase. Unfortunately, for those Members who may be hopeful of this, lesser known tax provisions that are likely to stay in the changes that come through the Democratic health care reform product would still raise taxes on the middle class.  Again, don't take my word for it. The Joint Committee on Taxation tells us so. Specifically, that committee sent a letter to Senator Crapo stating that tax provisions such as the cap on flexible savings accounts, the elimination of tax reimbursements for over-the-counter medicines and, most importantly, the individual mandate excise tax penalty will increase taxes on people making less than $250,000. That happens to be middle-class individual, middle-class families, and middle-class single parents.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record that letter.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                    Congress of the United States,                                  Joint Committee on Taxation,                                 Washington, DC, December 9, 2009.     Hon. Mike Crapo,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Crapo: This letter is in response to your      request of December 8, 2009, for information regarding the      ``Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,'' as introduced      by Senator Reid. In particular, you requested that we provide      you with information on the provisions in the bill that would      increase tax liability for taxpayers with adjusted gross      income (``AGI'') under $200,000 ($250,000 in the case of a      joint return).       In previous correspondence with you, we provided a      distributional analysis of the bill. In estimating the      distributional effects of the bill, we distributed items that      have economic incidence on individuals, including some items      that do not have statutory incidence. We are enclosing a copy      of that distributional analysis for reference. Included in      the distribution table are the following items that would      have statutory incidence as well as economic incidence on      individuals and are likely to increase tax liabilities for      some taxpayers with AGI below $200,000 ($250,000 in the case      of a joint return):       1. Raise the 7.5 percent AGI floor on medical expenses      deduction to 10 percent; and       2. Additional 0.5 percent hospital insurance tax on wages      in excess of $200,000 ($250,000 joint).       You asked us to enumerate items that we have not previously      distributed and that we believe could affect the tax      liability of taxpayers with AGI below $200,000 ($250,000 in      the case of a joint return). Below is a list of the      provisions that we have not previously distributed and that      have statutory incidence on individuals, with some of those      individuals likely to have income below your threshold:       1. Conform definition of medical expenses for health      savings accounts, Archer MSAs, health flexible spending      arrangements, and health reimbursement arrangements;       2. Increase the penalty for nonqualified health savings      account distributions to 20 percent;       3. Limit health flexible spending arrangements in cafeteria      plans to $2,500;       4. Impose a five-percent excise tax on cosmetic surgery and      similar procedures; and       5. Impose an individual mandate penalty.       I hope this information is helpful to you. If we can be of      further assistance in this matter, please let me know.           Sincerely,                                               Thomas A. Barthold.       Enclosure.
