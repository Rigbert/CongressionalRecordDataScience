 President, we have had a busy and productive week, and I believe we are now ready to adjourn for the Thanksgiving break. As I indicated, we will return to business on Monday, December 12. We expect to have some additional conference reports from the House, including the PATRIOT Act conference report. I do not anticipate votes on Monday, December 12 or Tuesday, December 13. However, Senators should be ready for a busy week beginning on Wednesday. That would be December 14. Votes are expected as early as Wednesday morning.                          ____________________[Page S13424]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
