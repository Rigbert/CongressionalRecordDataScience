Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hall) for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to seven brave and courageous souls. The crew of the Columbia space shuttle were men and women of medicine and soldiers who chose science over war. They explored space to heal and not to kill. These astronauts were smart and tough.  In their quest for the stars, they embodied the hopes, the dreams, and the aspirations of all humankind. These seven individuals were determined, dedicated, and committed. In a real sense, they personified the best of humankind.  To honor their memory, we must continue to look beyond our little planet we call Earth. We must continue to soar to the heavens.  The Columbia crew was leading us into the future, and we will continue to follow them. They wished to serve, and they did. They served all humanity.  Today, this day, we mourn with their families, the families in America and in Israel. God bless the families of the astronauts, and God bless our little planet Earth.
