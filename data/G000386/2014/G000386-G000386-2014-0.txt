R. 83, the Omnibus Appropriations Act:       The Secretary is directed to operate the marketing      assistance loan program in a way that encourages redemption      and minimizes forfeitures of loan commodities to the Federal      government, and enables the orderly marketing of loan      commodities throughout the year. Further, the Secretary shall      ensure that the marketing assistance loan program remains a      viable tool for all producers to use in marketing loan      commodities freely and competitively.  The Senate Agriculture Committee has confirmed this language simply intends to encourage USDA to better inform farmers of the status of any marketing loan gains they may receive during a marketing year for eligible commodities.  Furthermore, it was also conveyed by minority staff of the Senate Agriculture Committee that the referenced language in no way seeks to change implementation or enforcement of Section 1603 of the Agricultural Act of 2014.
