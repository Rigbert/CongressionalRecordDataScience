Chairman.  Mr. Chairman, I rise to enter into a colloquy with the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs of the Committee on Appropriations.  I would say to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Callahan), I have serious concerns about the operation of our Nation's assistance programs with respect to Ukraine and Russia.  The gentleman and his subcommittee have been most helpful, but I believe there are some remaining items that need attention, particularly in the arena of agriculture, where U.S. policy towards Russia and Ukraine have lacked primacy, have generally supported the old order rather than reform, and have been unrealistic in meeting the basic needs of villagers and small holders who are raising the majority of food in both nations.  First, most people know that agriculture depends upon seasons. There is a time to plant, a time to nourish, and a time to harvest. No one of us can change this natural cycle.  However, it is my experience that the Agency for International Development has not been sufficiently sensitive to these natural deadlines when considering applications for program assistance in agriculture. Approvals are delayed past planting dates. Termination dates are set earlier than harvest dates. It is as if the project is being set up to fail because these natural deadlines are being ignored.  Can the chairman assure me that as we move towards conference on this bill, that we can work to be sure that AID focuses more attention on agricultural reform in Ukraine and Russia, that it improves the speed of its application review process, and that the duration of these projects comports with the seasonal deadline?
