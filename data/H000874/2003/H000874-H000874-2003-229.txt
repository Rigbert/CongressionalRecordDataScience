Chairman, I think the gentleman is correct. And I said that at the beginning, that I think the chairman is doing the best with what he has been given. Our only argument is that he has not been given enough to meet the commitments made in the Republicans' budget and the President's request and the legislation we passed to leave no child behind.  But I think the gentleman is accurate, he has done the best he could with the resources he was given.
