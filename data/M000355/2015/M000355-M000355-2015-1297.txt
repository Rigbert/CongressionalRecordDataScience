 No Senator has to speak if he or she chooses not to. Any Senator who speaks will be limited to 1 hour. So this can go on for as long as Senators want or for as short a time as Senators prefer, provided no one is seeking recognition. But if anyone does seek recognition, they are limited to 1 hour, at which point the Chair puts the question. So I can't tell you with specificity when the vote will occur, but it will occur when no one is seeking recognition.  Once this bill is concluded later this evening, under the regular order, the cloture motions on the two FISA bills will ripen an hour after we convene tomorrow, which could be as early as 1 a.m. tonight.  So just to reiterate, if no Senators are seeking recognition, we would move to a vote shortly. If any Senator seeks recognition, they are limited to 1 hour. At the end of that, if no other Senator is seeking recognition, we will put the question and start the vote.  So I know of no other debate on this bill.
