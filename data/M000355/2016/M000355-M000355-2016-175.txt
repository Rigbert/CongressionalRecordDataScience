 President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported substitute amendment be withdrawn, that the Ayotte substitute amendment be agreed to, that the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, that the committee-reported title amendment be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.
