Speaker, today, finally, 18 months after it was promised, the United States House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly, almost 2 to 1 when finally forced, to provide some financial assistance to the 150,000 airline workers who have lost their jobs as a result of 9/11 and the horrendous recession in the United States. It is expected that as many as another 70,000 will lose their jobs because of the slowdown in travel due to the war in Iraq and even more probably with the threat of SARS and other problems.  It is time that we recognize the service of these people to our country and the fact that they need a little bit of help in their time of need. The Congress rushed through a $15 billion airline bailout shortly after 9/11 to try to help keep the industry in the air when people were afraid to fly. And that bailout provided more funds in one day than the entire deregulated industry has made in its entire history. Its entire 26-year history was eclipsed, their profits, by that one bill.  But the bill glaringly omitted any assistance directly to workers and it meaninglessly pretended to limit the salaries of CEOs. I have seen the results of the meaningless limits adopted by that legislation 2 years ago, or 18 months ago, in bailing out the airlines with the huge compensation packages and salaries and specially protected retirement that is being made available to the executives. It is defended. They said how could we get execs to work here if we did not pay them these outrageous salaries and if we did not totally protect their retirement? Guess what? All of the line workers, all the flight attendants, all the pilots, all the mechanics, all the gate agents, all the ticket agents, none of those people have specially protected pensions, and yet there has not been support from the industry or from this administration or from the majority in this House of Representatives to help those distressed workers.  And finally today, in one of those opportunities that rarely comes, a week ago when we were taking up the supplemental bill I tried to offer an amendment to help the workers; in fact, a Republican Member had gone earlier to a press conference with me and others to announce the legislation, and I asked him if he would go to the Committee on Rules and ask to have it made in order during the bill, and he said absolutely. Guess what? He did not show up. He did not show up because he was intimidated by the Republican leadership.  I came to the floor and offered that amendment, but the Republicans struck it down on a procedural technicality. They said we cannot take up a bill here to help the workers. We will get to it soon. Just like the 18 months we had promised previously, soon. Soon when?  Today, because we had one opportunity, which was a motion to instruct, usually a technical sort of thing in the House of Representative, we focused in on assistance to workers that has been long overdue; and when forced to vote, we find that nearly two-thirds of the United States House of Representatives supports that, but their leadership and the White House leadership has been preventing us from taking that step.  Congratulations to the House for that vote today and shame on the leadership and shame on the leadership downtown that did not allow that vote, and shame on them if they find some way to try to kill this in the conference committee because the White House is objecting that there is too much money in the bill to help the airlines now that we have added a little bit of money to directly help the workers. We will all be watching to see what comes in that final conference report, and we will know who killed the assistance to workers if it is stripped out of the bill.  After this overwhelming vote here and the overwhelming vote in the Senate, let the majority work its will and let us help these workers and their families.                          ____________________
