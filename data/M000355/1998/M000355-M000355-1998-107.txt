 President, before returning to the bill, many of us were at Senator Thurmond's 90th birthday, and I remember he said to all of us, ``If you eat right and don't drink whiskey and exercise, you will be here for my 100th birthday.''  We thank you for being an inspiration to us all, and we look forward to being at your 100th birthday party.  Thank you, Senator Thurmond, for your contributions.                          ____________________
