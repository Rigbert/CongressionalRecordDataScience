 As the gentleman knows, we have now passed six appropriation bills. Last week, consideration of the Interior bill was postponed. The gentleman and Mr. Rogers have both made representations that they hope to do all 12 appropriations bills.  You did not announce any appropriations bills on the schedule for next week. Can the gentleman tell me whether or not he expects to bring additional appropriations bills to the floor prior to the August break?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Yes, it is our intention to get back to the appropriations process as soon as possible. As the gentleman does know, there are some very serious and sensitive issues involved. We are in the midst of a constructive and bipartisan conversation on how we can resolve these issues. I will be sure to keep the Members updated as the appropriations bills are scheduled for continued consideration.
