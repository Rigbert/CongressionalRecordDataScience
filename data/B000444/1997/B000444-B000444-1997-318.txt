 I saw my very able colleague, the present chairman of the Judiciary Committee, on television the other day, and he was talking about the number of judges that were ``left hanging,'' who were not confirmed and sent back to the administration at the end of 1992, the Bush administration. And he cited an accurate number. But as my very distinguished friend, who is, as well, a scholar, knows, there is an old expression attributed to Benjamin Disraeli, who said there are three kinds of lies: lies, damn lies, and statistics.  What my able friend from Utah did not mention is that just like President Carter--Carter's judges is a separate charge we can go back to, but just like President Clinton, President Bush did not get his nominees up here until the end of the process.  In other words, they were late getting here. Notwithstanding the fact that he was late in getting his nominees up, the Senator may remember in the caucus over the objection of some Democrats who said the Republicans would never do this, I insisted we confirm judges up to the day we adjourned the Senate. During the last week the Senate was in that year, we confirmed seven judges. I could have easily just sneezed and they would not have been confirmed. And the fact is the reason why we did not confirm more is because we did not have time to hold the hearings and we were holding hearings on 20 or more a month.
