 President, it is my pleasure to rise today to congratulate Ms. Nora Hill of Yakima, Washington, who celebrated her 108th birthday on February 1, 1999.  Nora Maddie Wilson was born on February 1, 1891 in Benton County, Arkansas and is the youngest of twelve children. Nora never had a formal education, but was educated by her older brothers and sisters. She loved to read and had beautiful penmanship. Nora was also an avid quilter, making extra money by making quilts for other people. In 1911, Nora married John Bunyon Hill and had four children. In 1940 her family moved to the Yakima Valley in Washington state. Nora could handle a team of horses and a wagon with the best of them, however, she never wanted to learn how to drive an automobile, as it made her too nervous.  Nora is a survivor of cancer at the age of 99 and a broken hip at the age of 104. Both of Nora's sons, who served in World War II, have since passed away. Her daughters are still living. Nora has over sixty grand, great grand, great-great grand and great-great-great grand children.  Please all join me in wishing Ms. Nora Hill of Yakima, Washington a very happy 108th year.                          ____________________
