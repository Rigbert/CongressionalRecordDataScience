 Chairman, reclaiming my time, there is no argument with the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Peterson) in the sensethat we all want to be energy independent and that we want lower prices. No one is arguing about that.  I think the question is that we have an oil industry which some believe is already rigging the game and artificially raising prices; we have an oil industry today that makes billions and billions of dollars in profits. And some of us would ask, why are they not investing heavily into making more oil efficiently.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield?
