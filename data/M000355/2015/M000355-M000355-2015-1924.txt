 DURBIN. What I am asking is to try to amend this so it does have some balance. The majority leader mentioned one Democratic amendment and at least five or six Republican amendments to be considered tomorrow.  Mr. McCONNELL. We just had votes on Democratic amendments that the Senator's Members offered and he didn't want to agree to have a vote.
