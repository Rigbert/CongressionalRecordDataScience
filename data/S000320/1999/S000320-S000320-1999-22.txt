 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Sergeant Major Gordon R. ``Randy'' Taft, United States Army, a native of Decatur, Alabama, who is retiring this month from active duty after twenty-six years of distinguished service to the country. Sergeant Major Taft, who currently serves as the Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Director of the Defense Logistics Agency in Fort Belvoir, Virginia, has devoted his professional life to supporting the personal, administrative, and logistics needs of military men and women assigned around the world in defense of our freedom. His accomplishments are many and his reputation for leading and developing young soldiers is legendary. Randy Taft's selfless contributions to the National Defense will be missed, so as he transitions to new opportunities, I want to say thanks to him on behalf of a grateful Nation.  Sergeant Major Taft's numerous military awards and decorations reflect the tremendous impact he has had on the lives of America's fighting men and women. His decorations include the Legion of Merit, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, and the Humanitarian ServiceMedal. But the medals and certificates do not say it all. Like all Sergeants Major in their day-to-day activities and accomplishments, Randy Taft has served as a positive role model for a whole generation of the Army's finest soldiers. Whether he was serving as a personnel specialist, a platoon sergeant, a recruiter, a member of the Army's premier Honor Guard, or as the Senior Enlisted Advisor for the 44,000 person Defense Logistics Agency, he has led by example. His greatest accomplishments are the young soldiers he has helped mold into the kind of citizens this country can be proud to call our Army.  Mr. President, I am proud and honored to congratulate Sergeant Major Randy Taft upon the occasion of his retirement from the United States Army.                          ____________________
