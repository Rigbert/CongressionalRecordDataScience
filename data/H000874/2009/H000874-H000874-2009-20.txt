With respect to the bills that we are considering, obviously we have seven appropriation bills that have not yet been enacted. The continuing resolution expires on the 18th of December.  It is my hope that before that time we will have provision for the passage of all seven of the appropriation bills, either individually, which may be difficult because the Senate has not passed three of those bills on its floor. In one form or another we will have all seven of those bills passed prior to the 18th.  The Speaker, Leader Reid, and I all want to avoid another continuing resolution, which we think is not the best way to move forward. We are hopeful that we can accomplish that.  In addition, the regulatory reform bill you heard will be next week, the tax extenders. We have the unemployment insurance. We have the COBRA extension. Both of those expire on December 31. We have the PATRIOT Act, the provisions of which expire on December 31. We want to address that. We have got highway reauthorization, which also expires on December 31. We want to address that. And we have, I'm sure, other bills that we will be considering.  As you know, I know you're happy about it, I'm happy about it, Iran sanctions will be on the calendar as well, on the Suspension Calendar the week after next.
