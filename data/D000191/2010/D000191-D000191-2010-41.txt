 There are a number of issues that are extraordinarily important to the public, the traveling public, in these two pieces of legislation.  The pilot training requirement, something I've been talking about since the early 1990s, I was shocked to find out that for those airlines who don't have higher standards, that they can hire someone with 250 hours of experience and put them up there on the flight deck. This didn't become apparent to a lot of the American public until after the horrible tragedy of the Comair crash last year, but it has been something that has been going on for years.                              {time}  1545  These low-budget sorts of carriers are trying to drag down the industry. Instead of hiring people with higher qualifications, paying them an actual decent working wage, when you have someone working for a little bit over minimum wage flying your airplane, do you feel good about that? I don't. With very inadequate training and someone who's been up overnight because they can't afford to have their own apartment and they have to commute across the United States of America to go home and sleep in their mom's house? That's a heck of a way to run an industry.  By raising the bar and raising the standard, we will not disadvantage anybody except those who are dragging down the system. We will have a new, higher standard, which the good airlines are already meeting, and those who are not meeting are going to be forced to meet and they're going to be forced to pay competitive wages to get people who are trained to that level. This will make the American traveling public safer.  In addition to that, I first introduced with now-Senator Ben Cardin a bill on passenger rights in 1987. We've never quite gotten there until this legislation. We have some critical and basic passenger rights embedded in this FAA reauthorization--something that has been decades in the making. We came close a number of years ago but the then-Republican majority cut a deal for some voluntary standards which haven't been exactly subscribed to by some members in the industry. The industry is variable. Some are much better than others. This will make them all go to the same level of protections for consumers.  Again, we're putting a floor in there. If someone wants to exceed it, that's great. But let's move the floor up and go after those who are abusing passengers.  Then, finally, in terms of the overall system, this FAA bill will move us to a 21st century system for air traffic control, one that will allow the airlines much more use of our airspace, much more efficiently avoid storms, fly more fuel-efficient routes, avoid delays. That will be of tremendous benefit both to the industry and the traveling public, that additional predictability with NextGen.  I would recommend to our colleagues that we unanimously pass this legislation.
