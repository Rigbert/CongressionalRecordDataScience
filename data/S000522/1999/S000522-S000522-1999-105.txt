Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Connecticut for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, I rise to express my deep concern about the course of actions that appear to constitute retaliation against Linda Shenwick. In the most recent series of questionable actions, Ms. Shenwick has been ordered to vacate her office in New York by the close of business--she has already been told to do that--with a directed transfer to another Department of State position.  We believe this action is properly construed as retaliatory and in violation of the Whistleblower Protection Act. Accordingly, I and many other Members, including the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman), the chairman of the full committee, have asked that she be protected and that this proceeding needs to be looked into much more.  I think the amendment of the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Stearns) certainly puts us on record as being very much against what is happening here.  Let me also say that she has been a whistleblower in a bipartisan way, bringing information to the fore that needs to be brought forward.  One of the things that has galled me in 19 years as a Member of Congress--4 years now and counting as the chairman of the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights--is our inability to get information in a timely and usable form. There is not transparency with this administration. We need to have it. I think the whistleblower needs to be protected rather than retaliated and punished.  So I think the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Stearns) has done a very, very good thing with his amendment. I hope everybody will support it.
