 President, I rise today in support of the Access to Innovation for Medicare Patients Act of 2000 and to thank my fellow colleague from Washington state, Senator Gorton, for his work on this important legislation. The Access to Innovation for Medicare Patients Act is critical for Medicare beneficiaries who suffer from chronic and debilitating diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.  As many of you know, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis most often affect women. Until recently, few treatments existed. But advances in biotechnology products have given hope to thousands of individuals. Self-injectable biologic therapies have proven highly effective in reducing the daily, chronic pain that accompanies these devastating diseases. Patients have reported amazing results from self-injectable biologic therapies such as Enbrel in clinical trials.  However, before the Access to Innovation for Medicare Patients Act, no legislation existed that addressed adequate Medicare coverage of these therapies. Currently, Medicare only covers physician-administered therapies and most Medicare prescription drug coverage proposals do not address this issue at all or they place restrictive coverage caps on the use of self-injectable biologic therapies. Beneficiaries should not be denied access to the most effective and convenient therapies for their condition. Ultimately, coverage of self-injectable biologic therapies could save Medicare money in reducing costly, prolonged hospital stays and reducing the number of care provider visits. Most importantly, this legislation will improve the lives of Medicare beneficiaries who suffer from these diseases. Congress must ensure that seniors and the disabled receive the best possible medical treatment and therapies through the Medicare program.  Finally, on a more personal note, my family has had first-hand experience with the constant pain and frustration caused by multiple sclerosis. My father suffered from this devastating disease, and I witnessed his daily fight to overcome the pain that accompanied it. I know that self-injectable biologic therapy may have made his fight much easier. We cannot allow Medicare beneficiaries to suffer from preventable, overwhelming pain.  In the past, we worked to eliminate barriers to care and research. Today, we seek to tear down Medicare's barriers to self-injectable biologic therapies. Seniors and the disabled should not be denied these life-saving, treatments simply because they are self-injected.  Therefore, I rise today to join my colleagues, Senators Gorton, Mikulski, Cochran, Stevens, and Chafee in introducing the Access to Innovation for Medicare Patients Act. This legislation would: provide access to innovative therapies that are now on the market and making enormous improvements in the life and care of Medicare beneficiaries; allow physicians to prescribe the most appropriate therapy for their patients; make a common-sense, responsible change in Medicare; and eliminate the current bias against biotechnology therapies inherent in the Medicare program and many of the prescription drug proposals.  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
