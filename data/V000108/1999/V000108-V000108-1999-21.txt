Speaker, I offer a motion to instruct conferees.  The Clerk read as follows:       Mr. Visclosky moves that in resolving the difference      between the House and Senate, the     managers on the part of the House at the conference on the      disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the bill H.R. 2605, be      instructed to insist on the higher funding levels for the      U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Civil Works program included in      the House-passed bill.
