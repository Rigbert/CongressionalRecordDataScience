That is fine. I will initially mention a couple of points that are of concern to me.  First, this has been something my colleagues have worked on for a long period of time. I understand that is true because I have heard my friend from Virginia tell that to me and others on the committee. But we really didn't find out what it is.  I am reading something that came out of the Congressional Quarterly this morning. One sentence:       Emissions caps would start at the 2005 level in 2012 and      decrease annually, reaching the 1990 levels in 2020 and 65      percent below 1990 levels in 2050.  I assume that is an accurate description.
