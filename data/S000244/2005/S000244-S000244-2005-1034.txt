In addition to any other sums otherwise authorized to be      appropriated for this purpose, there are authorized to be      appropriated for each of fiscal years 2006 through 2009, the      sum of $10,000,000 to the Attorney General for prosecutions      needed to discourage the use of spyware and the practices      commonly called phishing and pharming.     SEC. 4. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING THE                    ENFORCEMENT OF CERTAIN CYBERCRIMES.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Software and electronic communications are increasingly      being used by criminals to invade individuals' and      businesses' computers without authorization.       (2) Two particularly egregious types of such schemes are      the use of spyware and phishing scams.       (3) These schemes are often used to obtain personal      information, such as bank account and credit card numbers,      which can then be used as a means to commit other types of      theft.       (4) In addition to the devastating damage that these      heinous activities can inflict on individuals and businesses,      they also undermine the confidence that citizens have in      using the Internet.       (5) The continued development of innovative technologies in      response to consumer demand is crucial in the fight against      spyware.       (b) Sense of Congress.--Because of the serious nature of      these offenses, and the Internet's unique importance in the      daily lives of citizens and in interstate commerce, it is the      sense of Congress that the Department of Justice should use      the amendments made by this Act, and all other available      tools, vigorously to prosecute those who use spyware to      commit crimes and those that conduct phishing and pharming      scams.
