 President, later today a former Senate colleague will be honored at the National Cathedral and laid to rest in Arlington. Senator Brooke was a trailblazer. He was a model of honesty and courage in office. Through his example, Edward W. Brooke reminded Americans that anything was possible in their country. In the years since Senator Brooke left office, we have seen the truth of that statement.  So while I am sure the Brooke family will mourn a man they loved today, just as any family would, I hope those who loved Senator Brooke can remember they have a lot to be proud of, too,as does the Senate, as does our country.  We thank this path-breaking pioneer for his many years of service to our country, and we honor him today.                          ____________________
