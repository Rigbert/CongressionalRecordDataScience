President, this is an important issue, one I have raised many times over the years. I have testified before the Banking Committee, and introduced numerous bills.  It is not a new issue. There have been at least four high-profile times in the last 12 years where proposed foreign acquisitions in the U.S. have threatened our security.  In 1998, President Clinton tried to turn over management of a 144-acre terminal at the former U.S. Naval Station in Long Beach to the Chinese Ocean Shipping Company, COSCO--a subsidiary of the People's Liberation Army.  I am going to quote from an LA Times article from that time:       The embattled COSCO deal came to an end Thursday night,      when congressional conferees submitted to Congress the 1998-     99 Defense Authorization Bill . . . Leading the effort to      block COSCO from the facility were Sen. James Inhofe (R-OK)      and Rep. Duncan Hunter [of the] San Diego area.  That was one battle that we won.  Since working in 1995 to prevent Los Angeles ports from being controlled by Chinese interests, I have continued my pressure on the issue. For example, I expressed my concern with the CFIUS process over 2 years ago in the spring of 2005 when I delivered four speeches on China. While examining this issue I came across a disturbing example of China buying the U.S. company, Magnequench Inc., and moving it piecemeal back to mainland China.  Let me read from the floor speech I gave on April 4, 2005:       I believe that CFIUS does not have a broad enough      conception of U.S. security. One example of CFIUS falling      short is with Magnequench International Incorporated. In 1995      Chinese corporations bought GM's Magnequench, a supplier of      rare earth metals used in the guidance systems of smart-     bombs. Over twelve years, the company has been moved      piecemeal to mainland China, leaving the U.S. with no      domestic supplier of a critical component of rare-earth      magnets. CFIUS approved this transfer.  The United States now has no domestic supplier of rare earth metals, which are essential for precision-guided munitions.  That was one we lost.  Following this series of four speeches that spring, on July 20, 2005, I introduced Senate amendment No. 1311 as an amendment to the annual National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006. My amendment prompted the very beginning of the legislative pursuit of this issue in recent years. For example, my amendment prompted another, later, second-degree amendment, Senate amendment No. 1335, by Senator Shelby, then the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.  I also testified before the U.S.-China Commission on July 21, 2005. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission is a bipartisan committee created in 2000 to monitor, investigate, and submit to Congress an annual report on the national security implications of the bilateral trade and economic relationship between the United States and the People's Republic of China.  The Commission is composed of 12 members, 3 of whom are selected by each of the majority and minority leaders of the Senate, and the Speaker and the minority leader of the House. The Commissioners serve 2-year terms.  Their recommendations are consistent with the amendment I introduced to the Defense authorization bill that would have made some of the necessary changes to CFIUS.  On September 28, 2005, the Government Accountability Office issued a report on CFIUS that is right in line with the recommendations of the US-China Commission. So this has not just been me saying that CFIUS is in need ofcritical change--it's the U.S.-China Commission and the GAO as well.  When my amendment stalled over a committee jurisdictional point, on September 29, 2005, I chose to introduce the changes as a stand-alone bill, the Foreign Investment Security Act of 2005, S. 1797, which was referred to the Banking Committee. That bill was the first bill introduced in recent years on this topic.  Later the Banking Committee held a hearing on the GAO report, and I testified before them on October 20, 2005, at that hearing.  In all of these ways I have just mentioned, the Banking Committee was prompted by me to pursue this topic.  In the past couple of years, several high profile business deals have been approved by CFIUS that would allow foreign-owned companies, in particular companies that are owned or controlled by foreign governments, to acquire other companies doing business in the United States.  More recently I was concerned with China's state-owned CNOOC attempted to buyout Unocal, a US oil company. We won this one because of Congressional pressure, and CNOOC withdrew its bid. Over the past 2 years, I have been pointing out that the CFIUS process has ignored some major issues which threaten our national security.  The most publicized deal was the state owned Dubai Ports World, DPW, purchase of Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation, P, that would have allowed DPW to take over the operations at various east coast ports in the United States. The public outcry against this deal lead DPW to abandon its plans to operate the U.S. ports and that portion of the takeover was sold to U.S. based companies. However since the DPW-P deal was canceled, other transactions have been approved by CFIUS that are just as questionable.  CFIUS has received over 1,600 notifications and investigated under 40. Of those, only one acquisition has been stopped by the President.  This is a critical issue at a critical time. CFIUS seems to only get scrutiny when some major deal is in the papers. I have been paying attention to it all along. It needs reform, and I hope we can make some progress.  I am glad that Congress is now taking a closer look at CIFIUS reform. Rest assured that I continue to push for this badly needed reform and as Congress addresses this issue, I will keep your thoughts in mind.  Note too that I will ensure in particular that the national security aspects of this work are appropriately attended to. I will not stand idly by and allow a bill that is weak on national defense to pass.  Let us all work together to ensure that the legislative process performs appropriately to defend our Nation, and let this bill I am introducing today be a new start.                          ____________________
