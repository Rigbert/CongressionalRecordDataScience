 What we do not want to do is hold up the Holbrooke hearing. We will ask unanimous consent that Senator Dodd have 15 minutes and that the Senator from Iowa have possibly another 10, 15 minutes during the period of the party caucuses in order to meet the deadline of the Holbrooke hearing at 2:30 p.m., which we have been fighting to get for a year and a half. That is the objective.  Obviously, the regular order is to move to steel. Unless my steel colleagues are willing to yield the Senatorfrom Iowa 15 minutes now, which he can request, I know of no other alternative. The Senator might ask.
