 Speaker, let me pick up on that point, if I could. Let us examine that point for a second.  In terms of distribution of wealth in America, you have the richest 1 percent now owning 42 percent of the wealth, which is more than the bottom 90 percent. One of the problems that all of us have is in dealing with the media. In terms of getting information out to people, one of the reasons that half the people in America no longer bother to vote is they are not getting information that is relevant to their lives. Who owns the media? When we talk about NAFTA, I remember this very clearly, it was quite unbelievable, poll after poll showed that the country was pretty evenly divided. Some were for NAFTA; some were anti-NAFTA.  We went through every single major newspaper in the United States of America, every single one of them. Were they evenly divided? Were they two-to-one pro-NAFTA? Every single one of them was pro-NAFTA, as was virtually every corporation in America. So you see who owns the media, we are seeing in terms of contributions to both political parties. Not an accident that you have this trade policy. This is a trade policy that works well for corporate America. It hurts the working people.  Where does the money come from to fund the parties? It comes from the wealthy people. And we see the results of that in terms of our trade policy. In almost every aspect of our lives we are seeing a greater and greater concentration of wealth and power. And in many ways I must say this country is beginning to look more like an oligarchy than it is like a democracy.
