 President, today, I am introducing a bill to require health insurance plans to cover medically necessary reconstructive surgery for congenital defects, developmental abnormalities, trauma, infection, tumors, or disease.  This bill is modeled on a California law and responds to reports that insurance plans are denying coverage for reconstructive surgery that doctors say is medically necessary. Too many plans are too quick to label it ``cosmetic surgery.'' The American Medical News has called the HMOs stance, ``a classic health plan word game. . . .''  Dr. Henry Kawamoto, testifying before the California Assembly Committee on Insurance stated:       It used to be that if you were born with something      deforming, or were in an accident and had bad scars, the      surgery performed to fix the problem was considered      reconstructive surgery. Now, insurers of many kinds are      calling it cosmetic surgery and refusing to pay for it.  Many doctors have told me that before the heavy penetration of managed care, repairing a person's abnormalities was considered reconstructive surgery and insurance companies reimbursed for the medical, hospital, and surgical costs. But today, many insurance companies and managed care organizations will not pay for reconstruction of many deformities because they deem them to be ``cosmetic'' and not a ``functional'' repair.  This bill is endorsed by the March of Dimes, Easter Seals, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Organization for Rare Disorders, the American College of Surgeons, the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons, the American Association of Pediatric Plastic Surgeons and the American Society of Maxillofacial Surgeons.  The children who face refusals to pay for surgery are the true evidence that this bill is needed. Here are some of the examples that were brought to the California legislature:  Hanna Gremp, a 6-year old from California, was born with a congenital birth defect, called bilateral microtia, the absence of an inner ear. Once the first stage of the surgery was complete, the Gremp's HMO denied the next surgery for Hanna. They called the other surgeries ``cosmetic'' and not medically necessary.  Michael Hatfield, a 19-year old from Texas, has gone through similar struggles. He was born with a congenital birth defect that is known as a midline facial cleft. The self-insured plan his parents had only paid for a small portion of the surgery which reconstructed his nose. The HMO also refused to pay any part of the surgery that reconstructed his cheekbones and eye sockets. The HMO considered some of these surgeries to be ``cosmetic.''  Cigna Health Care denied coverage for surgery to construct an ear for a little California girl born without one and only after adverse press coverage reversed its position saying that, ``It was determined that studies have shown some functional improvement following surgery.''  Qual-Med, another California HMO, initially denied coverage for reconstructive surgery for a little boy who also had microtia, authorizing it only after many appeals and two years delay.  The bill uses medically-recognized terms to distinguish between medically necessary surgery and cosmetic surgery. It defines medically necessary reconstructive surgery as surgery ``performed to correct or repair abnormal structures of the body caused by congenital defects, developmental abnormalities, trauma, infection, tumors, or disease to (1) improve functions; or (2) give the patient a normal appearance, to the extent possible, in the judgment of the physician performing the surgery.'' The bill specifically excludes cosmetic surgery, defined as ``surgery that is performed to alter or reshape normal structures of the body in order to improve appearance.''  Examples of conditions for which surgery might be medically necessary are the following: cleft lips and palates, burns, skull deformities, benign tumors, vascular lesions, missing pectoral muscles that cause chest deformities, Crouson's syndrome (failure of the mid-face to develop normally), and injuries from accidents.  This bill is an effort to address the arbitrariness of insurance plans that create hassles and question physicians' judgments when people try to get coverage under the plan they pay premiums for every month.  We need our body parts to function and, fortunately, modern medicine today can often make that happen. We can restore, repair, and make whole parts which by fate, accident, genes, or whatever, do not perform as they should. I hope this bill can make that happen.                                 ______                                       By
