It is incorporated in the Democrat Patients' Bill of Rights. I know Senator Collins of Maine is very interested in this issue. I think she is also convinced that this is important and significant.  Let me also say that the Senator from Oregon made reference to his experience as a senior advocate. There are, in fact, senior ombudsman programs throughout the United States which we support with the Older Americans Act. These programs have been very effective and are doing precisely what we want to do in the context of managed care.  Again, we just adopted an ombudsman program for military personnel in the TRICARE system. It was noncontroversial. In fact, we have a great deal of expectation and hope that this will be helpful to our military families. We are working together across the aisle. I hope that we can also incorporate this provision in whatever Patients' Bill of Rights legislation that emerges. It is not designed to be a tool of litigation; it is designed to be a tool of conciliation.  On those grounds, I am optimistic and hopeful.  But, once again, let me finally conclude by thanking the Senator from Oregon not only for our colloquy this afternoon but also for his support, not only on this issue but so many others.
