Speaker, for years, the University of Maryland Terrapin sports fans have advised our opponents that they should ``fear the turtle.'' Well, tonight, in my opinion, we can alter that formulation somewhat. They should ``revere the turtle.''  Tonight, Mr. Speaker, I want to extend my congratulations to Coach Brenda Frese and her coaching staff and the University of Maryland Women's Basketball Team on winning the national championship last night with an exciting, nail-biting 78-75 victory in overtime over a talented, courageous Duke University team.  Mr. Speaker, there is a deep, long-standing rivalry between University of Maryland, my alma mater, and Duke University. But I think anyone watching that game last night, regardless of who they were cheering for, had to be unbelievably impressed by the athleticism, the teamwork, the sportsmanship, the determination shown by the women of both teams, the University of Maryland and Duke, two great universities.                              {time}  1930  Quite simply, this was college athletics at its finest, and I might say, at least in the second half for me, the most entertaining. Who could not be impressed by this awesome display of basketball fundamentals, from shooting, to passing, to rebounding, to sound team defense.  In their come-from-behind win, the Terrapins erased a 13-point second-half deficit. The largest deficit that had been overcome, except for a 14-point deficit, and the freshman guard, Kristi Toliver, hit a 3-point shot with 6.1 seconds left to play, and she hit that shot over an extraordinary center who plays for Duke who is 6 foot 7 fully extended, and she got that shot over her outstretched hand. Kristi is not lacking in confidence, you can tell.  Terp Marissa Coleman said, ``We've played like this all year. Nothing gets to us. We never thought we were going to lose this game.'' That positive psychology led to victory.  The Terps win caps a tremendous 34-4 season and makes Maryland only the fourth university in America, and the gentleman from Connecticut is here, and Connecticut is one of those universities who has had both of its men's team win the national championship and its women's team win the national championship. They are two extraordinary programs, both the men and women in Connecticut. Stanford is one of those four, and then there are two ACC schools that fit that category, the University of North Carolina and the University of Maryland. Our men's team won the national championship just a few years ago in 2002.  The Lady Terps' championship quest was not paved with ease, however. Before reaching the final matchup with Duke University, the team defeated Sacred Heart 91-80; St. John's, an outstanding program, 81-74; and defending national champion Baylor 82-63; Utah in overtime 75-65; then perennial powers North Carolina, 81-70. And lastly, for the national championship, the extraordinarily good Duke team.  Mr. Speaker, this was a consummate team win for the most unselfish of teams. In this championship game, for example, three Terps scored 16 points each. One scored 12 points, and another scored 10 points. In other words, all five starters were in double figures.  And, what makes this championship win even more impressive is that the Terps have no seniors on their team. They started two freshmen, two sophomores and one junior so we are going to be around for a little bit of time. The Lady Terps are extraordinary young women, proud today, as they will be tomorrow when I think we are visiting the White House. They are: Charmaine Carr; Marissa Coleman; Shay Doron; Laura Harper, who was voted the most outstanding player of the tournament among a lot of outstanding players; Crystal Langhorne, an All American; Kristi Marrone; Kalika France; Ashleigh Newman; Aurelie Noriez; Jade Perry; Angel Ross; Kristi Toliver and Sa'de Wiley-Gatewood.  The coaching staff, in addition to Head Coach Frese, includes Jeff Walz, Erica Floyd, Joanna Bernabei, and Director of Basketball Operations Mark Pearson.  Let me say that Head Coach Frese deserves extraordinary credit for turning the Maryland women's program around in just 4 short years she has been at Maryland. We got her from Minnesota. I know Minnesota is sorry to have lost her, but what a great gain for us. Brenda arrived in College Park in 2003 from the University of Minnesota after leading the Gophers to a 2-8 record in 2002 and being named the Associated Press National Coach of the Year.  In 2003, the Terps went 10-18 in a rebuilding year, and in both 2004 and 2005, just the next season, Brenda Frese saw her teams advance to the second round of the NCAA tournament with records of 18-13 and 22-10 respectively in those years.  Let me also note the extraordinary leadership and vision of the University of Maryland's athletic director, Debbie Yow, who recruited Brenda Frese to take the head coaching job.  My colleagues will be interested to know that some years ago one of the curmudgeons and one of the real characters, and I think one of the most popular Members of this body came up to me, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Coble) and he said to me, You are a friend of the President of the University of Maryland.  I said, Yes, I am.  He said, Well, you have considered a woman for Athletic Director. Her name is Debbie Yow. She is from North Carolina.  Now this curmudgeon does not always impress me as being a feminist, and I thought to myself if Howard Coble thinks this woman can be the Athletic Director, and I had never met her, but I knew she was an impressive lady.  The next day I picked up the phone and called the President of the College Park campus and said I don't know Debbie Yow, but I will tell you this, in North Carolina she has a Congressman who thinks she is absolutely one of the best talents around. I think we ought to hire here. Within a week we hired Debbie Yow to be our Athletic Director. Shortly thereafter she brought Ralph Friedgen to lead our football team, and he had three 10-win seasons back to back, although we have not done too well the last 2 years.  But in closing, let me say that we are extraordinarily proud of the Lady Terps. As the father of three women in particular, I am proud of the extraordinary talent displayed and the courage displayed and the athleticism displayed by not just the Maryland team but by all of the young women who played the NCAA tournament.                          ____________________
