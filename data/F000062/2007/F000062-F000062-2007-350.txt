 President, I am offering today private relief legislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Alfredo Plascencia Lopez and his wife, Maria del Refugio Plascencia, Mexican nationals living in San Bruno, CA.  I have decided to offer legislation on their behalf because I believe that, without it, this hardworking couple and their four United States citizen children would endure an immense and unfair hardship. Indeed, without this legislation, this family may not remain a family for much longer.  In the 18 years that the Plascencias have been here, they have worked to adjust their status through the appropriate legal channels, only to have their efforts thwarted by inattentive legal counsel.  Repeatedly, the Plascencia's lawyer refused to return their calls or otherwise communicate with them in any way, thereby leaving them in the dark. He also failed to forward crucial immigration documents, or even notify the Plascencias that he had them.  Because of the poor representation they received, Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia only became aware that they had been ordered to leave the country 15 days prior to their deportation.  Although the family was stunned and devastated by this discovery, they acted quickly to fire their attorney for gross incompetence, secure competent counsel, and file the appropriate paperwork to delay their deportation to determine if any other legal action could be taken.  For several reasons, it would be tragic for this family to be removed from the United States.  First, since arriving in the United States in 1988, Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia have proven themselves to be a responsible and civic-minded couple who share our American values of hard work, dedication to family, and devotion to community.  Second, Mr. Plascencia has been gainfully employed at Vince's Shellfish for the past 14 years, where his dedication and willingness to learn have propelled him from part-time work to a managerial position. He now oversees the market's entire packing operation and several employees. The President of Vince's Shellfish, in one of the several dozen letters I have received in support of Mr. Plascencia, referred to him as ``a valuable and respected employee'' who ``handles himself in a very professional manner'' and serves as ``a role model'' to other employees. Others who have written to me praising Mr. Plascencia's job performance have referred to him as ``gifted,'' ``trusted,'' ``honest,'' and ``reliable.''  Third, like her husband, Mrs. Plascencia has distinguished herself as a medical assistant at a Kaiser Permanente hospital in the Bay Area. Not satisfied with working as a maid at a local hotel, Mrs. Plascencia went to school, earned her high school equivalency degree, improved her skills, and became a medical assistant.  For 5 years, Mrs. Plascencia was working in Kaiser Permanente's Oncology Department, where she attended to cancer patients. Her colleagues, many of whom have written to me in support of her, commend her ``unending enthusiasm'' and have described her work as ``responsible,'' ``efficient,'' and ``compassionate.''  In fact, Kaiser Permanente's Director of Internal Medicine, Nurse Rose Carino, wrote to say that Mrs. Plascencia is ``an asset to the community and exemplifies the virtues we Americans extol: hardworking, devoted to her family, trustworthy and loyal, [and] involved in her community. She and her family are a solid example of the type of immigrant that America should welcome wholeheartedly.'' Nurse Carino went on to write that Mrs. Plascencia is ``an excellent employee and role model for her colleagues. She works in a very demanding unit, Oncology, and is valued and depended on by the physicians she works with.''  The physicians themselves confirm this. For example, Dr. Laurie Weisberg, the Chief of Oncology at Kaiser Permanente, writes that Mrs. Plascencia ``is truly an asset to our unit and is one of the main reasons that it functions effectively.''  Together, Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia have used their professional successes to realize many of the goals dreamed of by all Americans. They saved up and bought a home. They own a car. They have good health care benefits and they each have begun saving for retirement. They want to send their children to college and give them an even better life.  This private relief bill is important because it would preserve these achievements and ensure that Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia will be able to make substantive contributions to the community in the future. It is important, also, because of the positive impact it will have on the couple's children, each of whom is a United States citizen and each of whom is well on their way to becoming productive members of the Bay Area community.  Christina, 14, is the Plascencia's oldest child, and an honor student at Parkside Intermediate School in San Bruno.  Erika, 10, and Alfredo Jr., 8, are enrolled at Belle Air Elementary, where they have worked hard at their studies and received praise and good grades from their teachers. In fact, the principal of Erika's school recognized her as the ``Most Artistic'' student in her class. Erika's teacher, Mrs. Nascon, remarked on a report card, ``Erika is a bright spot in my classroom.''  The Plascencia's youngest child is 3-year-old Daisy.  Removing Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia from the United States would be most tragic for their children. These children were born in the United States and, through no fault of their own, have been thrust into a situation that has the potential to alter their lives dramatically.  It would be especially tragic for the Plascencia's older children--Christina, Erika, and Alfredo--to have to leave the United States. They are old enough to understand that they are leaving their schools, their teachers, their friends, and their home. They would leave everything that is familiar to them. Their parents would find themselves in Mexico without a job and without a house. The children would have to acclimate to a different culture, language, and way of life.  The only other option would be for Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia to leave their children here with relatives. This separation is a choice which no parents should have to make.  Many of the words I have used to describe Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia are notmy own. They are the words of the Americans who live and work with the Plascencias day in and day out and who find them to embody the American spirit. I have sponsored this private relief bill, and ask my colleagues to support it, because I believe that this is a spirit that we must nurture wherever we can find it. Forcing the Plascencias to leave the United States would extinguish that spirit.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the private relief bill and the numerous letters of support my office has received from members of the San Bruno community be entered into the Record immediately following this statement.  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 841       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(b) Adjustment of Status.--If Alfredo Plascencia Lopez and      Maria Del Refugio Plascencia enter the United States before      the filing deadline specified in subsection (c), Alfredo      Plascencia Lopez and Maria Del Refugio Plascencia shall be      considered to have entered and remained lawfully and shall be      eligible for adjustment of status under section 245 of the      Immigration and Nationality Act as of the date of enactment      of this Act.

Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       To Whom It May Concern: I am writing to attest to the      character and work ethic of Marla Del Refugio Plascencia. I      am the Director of Medicine at Kaiser Permanente, South San      Francisco. I have known Maria since she was hired as a      medical assistant into my department in July 2000.       Maria is an excellent employee and role model for her      colleagues. She is extremely dependable; She works in a very      demanding unit, Oncology, and is valued and depended on by      the physicians she works with. Maria is flexible, thorough      and proactive. She pays attention to detail and identifies      potential problems before they occur. In addition, her      bilingual skills enhance the patient care experience for our      members who speak Spanish.       In her short tenure here, Maria found time to volunteer      with our community outreach programs. She served as a      volunteer interpreter for our recent Neighbors in Health      event, wherein free health care was provided to uninsured      children in our local community.       I can't say enough about Maria and the type of person she      is. I feel fortunate to have her in my department. She is an      asset to the community and exemplifies the virtues we      Americans extol: hardworking, devoted to her family,      trustworthy and loyal employee, involved in her community.      She and her family are a solid example of the type of      immigrant that America should welcome wholeheartedly.       It would be an incredible miscarriage of justice if Maria      and Alfredo are deported. They came to this country to pursue      a better life and afford their children opportunities that      they wouldn't have in Mexico. They have begun to do just that      by establishing roots in the community and purchasing a home.      Deporting Maria and Alfredo would rip their family apart and      result in either depriving their children of a loving family      or depriving them of their rights as American citizens if      they leave the country of their birth with their parents.       I pray that you will allow them the opportunity to live in      this country.           Sincerely,                                                  Rose Carino, RN,     Director, Department of Medicine.                                  ____     Sen. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       My name is Rosa Mendoza, and I am a resident of San Bruno,      my letter is with the purpose of presenting my observations      on Maria and Alfredo Plascencia whom I have known for about 6      yrs, when Maria started to work for Kaiser Permanente, as I'm      a Kaiser Permanente employee myself.       Maria is a very respectful person, and owns very good moral      principles; she likes to help people according to each other      necessities. I support the private legislation introduced in      their behalf, as this type of people is what each country      needs. Here by I'm asking Senator Feinstein to please keep      working on their case for them to become residents of this      country, as this family needs to stay together. If there      should be any questions please do not hesitate to contact me      at (650) 303-8930.           Sincerely,     Rosa Mendoza.                                  ____                                                 January 10, 2007.     Re: Alfredo Plascensia Lopez and Maria Del Refugio Plascencia     Sen. Dianne Feinstein,     Washington, DC.       To Whom It May Concern: The purpose of this letter is to      present my observations on Alfredo Plascencia Lopez and Maria      Del Refugio Plascencia's character and work ethic.       I have worked with Maria Del Refugio Plascencia for the      past six years and in that time I have gotten to know her as      a person and a friend. Maria is always willing to help in any      situation. She shows great compassion to the patients, as she      is always willing to assist them. In the past year, I have      also gotten to know Alfredo Plascencia Lopez as well as their      five children. Maria and Alfredo have invited my daughter and      me to their home on many occasions and while visiting there,      I have always felt very welcomed as my daughter feels the      same. They treat my daughter as if she were one of their own.       In the past six years, I have also observed how hard      working both Maria and Alfredo are. But while working as hard      as they do both still find time to create a balance between      work, home, family, friends and church. Maria and Alfredo do      all they can for their family, employers and anyone who is in      need of a helping hand. As a mother, I can't imagine having      to go through what Maria and Alfredo are going through right      now. It would be unfair to the Plascencia family if Maria and      Alfredo were to be deported at this time in their lives. It      would also cause a great loss to the Oncology department as      Maria offers tremendous support to all of us here at Kaiser.       Hereby I want to express my gratitude to Senator Feinstein      for the great work that she is doing on the private      legislation, and at the same time I want to ask to please      keep helping them by renewing the introduction of the      legislation. I hope that there is justice in this case and      some consideration of everyone involved in this situation.      Not only will Maria and Alfredo be affected by being deported      but also this could change the lives of their children,      family, friends, co-workers and the patients here at Kaiser.      We need more people like the Plascencia's in our country, as      they are a model family.           Sincerely,                                                Erika Hidalgo,                                   Medical Assistant/Receptionist,                                                Kaiser Permanente.                                 ______                                       By
