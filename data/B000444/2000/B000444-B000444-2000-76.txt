 But today the House passed, by a vote of 415-3, the Violence Against Women Act--24 Republicans and all Democrats. Seventy-one cosponsored the Violence Against Women Act.  I wonder if the leader would be willing to agree to a 10-minute time agreement and we could vote on the Violence Against Women Act tomorrow or some day?
