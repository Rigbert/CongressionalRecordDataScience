President, I pay tribute to my colleague and friend, Senator Brownback, for his eloquent speech on behalf of those who are disadvantaged and deserve protection from the law. He made an outstanding speech.  I rise to express my support of Judge John Roberts in regard to his nomination as Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. I know what the committee has done, and I know what the majority of Senators will likely do, and that is to vote in favor of Judge Roberts. But I also believe that an openminded individual, applying Kansas common sense, would reach the same conclusion that I have come to hold.  It is no small event for a Senator to have the opportunity to participate in the confirmation of a candidate for the position of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Over the course of our Nation's history, the Senate has come together 155 times to vote on a Supreme Court Justice. This occasion marks the 17th time to confirm a Chief Justice. So I am humbled and honored to be part of this moment of history.
