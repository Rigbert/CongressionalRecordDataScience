 What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. I would hope any Democratic amendments could come in just as quickly as possible, and we think we have a good bill. Hopefully there will not be many. I agree with what the Senator said about the Defense bill. We have a CR, and we really need to get cracking. Time is of the essence.  We have been sitting here for a couple of hours waiting for amendments. There have been none thus far, and I think the word is out: Now is the time. Please, Members, if you have amendments, please file them. We have had one amendment just filed on the Republican side and know of a couple of others, but that is about it at this stage.  Let me thank the ranking member. I guess we just sit here and wait.  Thank you, Mr. President.  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.
