  In the past 30 years, since the Supreme Court upheld a woman's right to choose, a great deal has changed for women in America. But now, in 2003, we are about to push women back to where they were in the 1950s, a generation that I remember well, a generation of passing the plate to raise money for abortions in Mexico, a generation of back alley abortions, a generation of tremendous mortality and morbidity for women, a generation of fear. It makes no sense.  The fact that a majority of the House-Senate conference stripped out sense-of-the-Senate language that merely summarized Federal abortion law should be exhibit A for anyone who doubts that this bill is really a frontal political attack on choice in America.  I am also disappointed that the conference refused to accept a commonsense amendment I offered to the bill before us today. That amendment, as I said, would have banned all postviability abortions except if determined by the doctor that such an abortion was necessary to protect the life and health of the woman.  With that amendment, the sponsors of this bill could have gotten what they wanted legally. Why didn't they take it? The reason they didn't take it is because if you have an anti-choice bill with a nebulous, vague definition, you can chill all legal second trimester abortions.  Let me tell you one more thing about the amendment I offered. To ensure compliance with the amendment, we even provided that a doctor who would perform a postviability abortion on a woman whose health or life is not at risk could be fined up to $100,000. That amendment would have put medical decisions back into the hands of doctors but, at the same time, prevented abuses. In my view, if a doctor believes such a procedure is necessary to protect a woman's life or health, then he or she should be able to perform that procedure.  Why do some Senators believe that the Federal Government even needs to be involved in this issue?  Why is this legislation even necessary? Roe v. Wade clearly allows States to ban all postviability abortions unless it is necessary to protect a woman's life or health, and 41 States already have bans on the books. All States are free today to do so if their State legislatures so choose.  The fact is, abortions this late in the pregnancy are rare and usually performed under tragic circumstances, such as a brain outside of a child's skull or vital inner workings outside of the body that cannot be connected.  Mr. President, the whole focus of many in this Congress and in the conservative movement has been to give power and control back to the States and eliminate the Federal Government from people's lives. So anyone who believes in States' rights must now question the logic of imposing a new Federal regulation on States in a case such as this, where States already have the authority to ban postviability abortions and where a dominant majority of States--41--have already enacted such a law.  Is Federal legislation really necessary? No. I say to my colleagues that this clearly is a political bill designed to fan the flames and invade Roe v. Wade and weaken it substantially. It attempts to ban a medical procedure without properly identifying that procedure in medical terms.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a number of letters demonstrating that this legislation poses a serious threat to women's health be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       Association of Reproductive                                         Health Professionals,                                 Washington, DC, October 20, 2003.     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: We are writing on behalf of thousands of      health care providers to urge you and your colleagues to      oppose federal legislation criminalizing safe abortion      procedures (S. 3, the so-called ``Partial Birth Abortion Ban      Act of 2003'').       This bill is deceptive, is based on a number of flawed      assumptions, and is unnecessary. First, ``partial-birth      abortion'' is not a medical term but a non-scientific and      politically biased rhetorical expression invented by      activists to convey misrepresentations about safe and      medically necessary abortion procedures. The term ``partial-     birth abortion'' is not used by any of the major national      medical organizations, including the American College of      Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Women's      Association, the American Public Health Association, and the      Association of Reproductive Health Professionals (ARHP).       Second, the bill is deceptive because it does not specify      any particular stage of pregnancy--contrary to assurances by      its sponsors that the bill's intent is to focus only on third      trimester abortions.       Finally, abortions during the third-term are already      illegal in almost every state except to save the woman's life      or health, and are rarely performed. This legislation is      unnecessary and is an example of political ideology trumping      science and appropriate medical decision-making.       Published literature attests to the fact that placing      restrictions on abortion services is harmful to the health of      women and that medical decisions should be left to health      care providers. ARHP is concerned because S. 3 dictates      health care methodology to the clinicians who must provide      medical care under the most difficult of circumstances.      Restrictions imposed by the government on abortion services      will not reduce the need for abortion or the quantity of      abortions performed, it will only make abortion less safe.       If you or members of your staff have any questions or would      like additional information, please contact Wayne C. Shields      at the ARHP office at (202) 466-3825 or [email protected]           Sincerely,     Felicia H. Stewart, MD,       Chair, ARHP Board of Directors.     Wayne C. Shields,       President and CEO.                                  ____                                                 October 17, 2003.     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: The National Latina Institute for      Reproductive Health (NLIRH) strongly opposes S. 3, the      ``Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003''. As an      organization that is dedicated to ensuring the     fundamental human right to reproductive health care for      Latinas, their families, and their communities, we cannot      support the proposed legislation which would drastically      inhibit a woman's right to choose, as well as prohibit      medically safe procedures which are often necessary to      protect and save the life of the woman.       NLIRH supports the right of every Latina to be in charge of      her own life, to determine if and when to have children, and,      to seek the full range of reproductive health options      available. These health options include access to quality      gynecological care, family planning and contraception,      fertility treatment, and all abortion services. Contrary to      popular belief, Latinas do access abortion services, and 51%      of Latinas actively identify as pro-choice. While abortion      may not be an option for every Latina, we support the right      of every Latina to make her own personal and private decision      about abortion and we also support efforts to restore public      funding for abortion. For Latinas, accessing abortion      services is often difficult already, due to cultural,      linguistic, legal, and economic barriers, and banning safe      abortion procedures would only further impede upon our rights      to choose what is medically and personally appropriate for      us.       Restricting and criminalizing any abortion procedure would      undermine the fundamental human right to self-determination,      and would endanger the lives of women for whom abortion may      be medically necessary. Decisions regarding when to have      children are often difficult, personal, and morally      complicated, and should be made only by the woman.       We appreciate your attention to our concerns, and strongly      urge you to vote against the so-called ``Partial-Birth      Abortion Ban of 2003.''           Sincerely,     ------.                                  ____                                  Medical Students for Choice,                                    Oakland, CA, October 19, 2003.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of Medical Students for      Choice, a national organization representing more than 7,000      medical students and residents, I write to urge your      opposition to H.R. 760/S. 3, the (so-called) Partial-Birth      Abortion Ban Act of 2003.       Medical Students for Choice is dedicated to ensuring that      woman's right to choose from a full range of reproductive      health options is preserved. We believe that a physician, in      consultation with the patient, should make the decision      regarding what method should be used to terminate a      pregnancy. Physicians need to have all medical options      available in order to provide women with the best medical      care possible.       We are opposed to H.R. 760/S. 3 because we believe this and      other legislative and judicial restrictions to safe,      medically accepted abortion procedures severely jeopardize      women's health and well-being. We also oppose the bill      because it fails to include adequate health exception      language in instances where certain procedures may be      determined by a physician to be the best or most appropriate      to preserve the health of the woman. This bill ties the hands      of physicians and endangers the health of women. Further, we      believe that this bill is deceptive and represents a thinly      veiled attempt to restrict women's access to all abortion      procedures. ``Partial birth'' is a political term, not a      medical term. Despite the anti-choice political rhetoric,      this bill is neither designed nor written to ban only one      procedure. The bill's prohibitions would apply well before      viability and could ban more than one procedure. These so-     called ``partial birth'' abortion bans are deliberately      designed to erode the protections of Roe v. Wade.       Thank you for your attention to our concerns regarding the      negative effect this legislation would have to a woman's      right to a safe, legal abortion.           Sincerely,                                         Angel M. Foster, D.Phil.,     President.                                  ____                                            Mexican American Legal                                 Defense and Educational Fund,                                 Washington, DC, October 14, 2003.     Re Conference Report H. Rept. 108-288--The Partial Birth          Abortion Act of 2003.       Dear Senator: I am writing on behalf of the Mexican      American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) to urge      you to oppose Conference Report H. Rept. 108-228, the so-     called Partial Birth Abortion Act of 2003 (the Act). MALDEF,      a national non-profit organization whose mission is to      protect and promote the civil rights of the over 35 million      Latinos living in the United States, believes this      legislation is unconstitutional and harmful to women's      health.       The Act is unconstitutional for at least three reasons.      First, the legislation does not include a health exception.      The Supreme Court has held that laws regulating abortion must      adequately safeguard a woman's health. This legislation does      not include such an exception. Contrary to the legislative      findings indicating that a health exception to the ban is      never necessary, many physicians have stated that this      legislation would prevent them from performing procedures      that are necessary to protect a woman's health. Second, the      legislation is unconstitutional because the language of the      ban is overly broad. The ban is not limited to specific      medical procedures and actually could prohibit the safest      abortion techniques in certain cases, thereby unduly      burdening a woman's right to choose. Finally, determining      which procedure is medically necessary is a medical decision      that should be made by a physician and his or her patient,      not by the federal government. The Supreme Court has      emphasized the need for physicians to have adequate      discretion to make these types of medical decisions.       The Supreme Court directly addressed this type of ban in      Stenberg v. Carhart, 530 U.S. 914 (2000). In Stenberg, the      Court found Nebraska's ban on so-called partial birth      abortion unconstitutional because the legislation's language      was overly broad and it lacked a health exception. The      federal version of the ban now pending before you contains      the same flaws and is similarly unconstitutional.       This legislation is an unprecedented attempt by the federal      government to restrict women's access to abortion that      ultimately jeopardizes the health of women. MALDEF strongly      opposes this legislation and urges you to do so as well. If      you have any questions please contact Angela Hooton at (202)      293-2828.           Sincerely,                                                Antonia Hernandez,     President and General Counsel.                                  ____                                         National Latina Institute                                      for Reproductive Health,                                   Brooklyn, NY, October 17, 2003.

Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the Black Women's      Health Imperative (formerly National Black Women's health      Project), I am writing to convey our opposition to H.R. 760,      the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003.       As the only national organization that is solely dedicated      to the health of the nation's 19 million Black women and      girls, the Black Women's Health Imperative (the Imperative),      has focused on issues that disproportionately affect Black      women from access to healthcare, inclusive of reproductive      health care. The Imperative has been in the forefront      advocating for a comprehensive agenda that includes the full      range of medical and socially available technologies and      services for fertility management.       We believe that H.R. 760 would restrict safe, medically      acceptable abortion procedures that would severely endanger      women's health and well-being, disproportionately affecting      low-income African American women. Moreover, we feel that      this legislation fails to include adequate health exception      language in instances where certain procedures may be      determined by a physician to be the most appropriate to      preserve the health of the woman.       For the past 20 years, the Black Women's Health Imperative      has been instrumental in highlighting disparities in health      and will continue to play an essential role in helping to      shape policies that seek to improve African American women's      overall health. On behalf of our constituency, we urge the      United     States Senate to oppose H.R. 760, the Partial-Birth Abortion      Ban Act of 2003.           Sincerely,     Lorraine Cole, PhD.                                  ____            [From Medscape General Medicine, June 25, 2003]The Federal Ban on So-called ``Partial-Birth Abortion'' Is a Dangerous                     Intrusion Into Medical Practice                    (By Paul D. Blumenthal, MD, MPH)       Congress has passed the ``Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of      2003,'' the first federal legislation ever enacted that bans      abortion procedures. This unprecedented intrusion by Congress      into medical practice will reduce access to second-trimester      abortions and defines the doctors who perform them as      criminals. Moreover, by undermining a woman's right to select      the reproductive healthcare most appropriate for her and      interfering with a physician's ability to make medical      decisions, Congress derogates the physician-patient      relationship.       Proponents of this law claim that it bans only a particular      procedure. However, the legislation does not define what is      being banned in such a way that a physician can know exactly      what is prohibited. There is no formally recognized medical      procedure to which the term ``partial-birth abortion'' used      in this legislation applies; it is therefore vague and      medically incorrect. None of my colleagues know or could      state whether the abortion procedures they now perform are      covered under this law. Indeed, as I read the definition of      the banned procedures, any of the safest, most common      abortion methods used throughout the second trimester of      pregnancy could proceed in such a manner as to be outlawed.      One can only assume that by intimidating medical providers      with the constant threat of criminal accusations, the intent      of this law is to frighten the medical community--the same      community that swears an ancient oath to use its knowledge      and skills to serve and protect the lives of its patients--     from performing pregnancy terminations at all.       The practice of high-quality medicine requires that      physicians be knowledgeable about and able to perform variety      of procedures to accomplish a given treatment or therapy.      Planning any procedure is done in consultation with the      patient, and it is based on the medical judgment, experience,      and training of the provider, and the individual      circumstances of the patient's condition. Sometimes, as a      result of developments during a surgery or in a patient's      condition, it becomes necessary to adapt and choose a      different course or modify the procedure as it progresses.      These decisions are often quite complex and mandate that      physicians use their best professional and clinical judgment,      most often right on the spot. These are decisions that should      be made by physicians and their patients stone. Indeed, when      performing surgery, there is not time for a call to Congress,      the Supreme Court, or anyone else in order to obtain      clarification of the statutory intent or to request a waiver.      This law evokes a preposterous image of physicians with their      attorneys present in the operating room advising and      counseling them at each step, and perhaps even in the middle      of surgery suggesting a physician alter a technique deemed      best for the patient to avoid committing a federal crime.      Physicians and surgeons should be allowed to practice their      art in accordance with time-honored peer-reviewed standards      and with only the interests of the patient at . . . .
