Mr. Chairman, just to respond very briefly. First of all, this is all about foreign aid grant money and whether or not we will have modest conditions that protect children.  Mr. Chairman, it was mentioned a moment ago that we have never voted on this issue before. That is patently untrue. I offered the amendment supporting the Reagan-Bush Mexico City policy year in and year out going back to 1985. This body has voted repeatedly, close to 15 years of voting on this very policy, identical to what we have under consideration today. So hopefully, that argument, that false statement will not be made again.  Let me remind my colleagues, the Hyde, Barcia, Smith, Obestar Amendment does not reduce family planning by one penny; we condition it; we put in safeguards. Who we give our tax dollars to does matter. Pro-abortion organizations perform and promote abortions. Let us give our tax dollars to those that will divest themselves of abortion, and simply stick to family planning.
