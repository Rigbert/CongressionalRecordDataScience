Mr. Speaker, the time is always right to do right. And raising the minimum wage is the right thing to do.  This is not just an economic issue, Mr. Speaker, this is a moral issue. Hard working people deserve the right to earn a livable wage. The minimum wage is at a 40-year low. No one can live, much less support a family, on $8,400 a year.  Mr. Speaker, stop playing politics with people's lives. Bring a clean minimum wage bill to this floor. Do not load it up and bring it down with your pet programs.  The American people, hard-working people, are watching and waiting. Raise the minimum wage.                          ____________________
