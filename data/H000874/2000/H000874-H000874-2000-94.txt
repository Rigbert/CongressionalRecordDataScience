Speaker, it is my real honor to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis), a distinguished civil rights leader, Member of Congress, humanitarian, and the cosponsor of this legislation. A gentleman who has been a giant in bringing the reality of the words that I intoned earlier that are included in our Declaration of Independence, and the promises incorporated in our Constitution, to reality for all Americans.
