If the Senator will yield for this comment, I assume the Capitol will stay open. God forbid it would not, because after that we will run out of rooms. But the distinguished majority leader and the Secretary of the Senate have helped us in getting rooms. Senator Schumer is delaying his departure to help move some of these. We will do our best.  Again, I urge everybody to be on time because the pressure is going to be on. We want to let a lot of the staff who won't otherwise have to be around have a chance to go home. I think their families need them at this time.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
