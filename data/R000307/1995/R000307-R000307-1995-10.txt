Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in admiration and respect for the gentleman from New Mexico [Mr. Skeen] and his able staff, but in reluctant opposition to the bill.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in reluctant opposition to this bill for several reasons.  Earlier this year the Committee on Agriculture and the Appropriations Committee conducted a series of discussions and meetings with leadership over the issue of mandatory and discretionary spending and which committee should receive credit for any reductions in these accounts.  From these talks an agreement was forged with the Speaker, the Appropriations chairman, the Budget chairman and myself as chairman of the Agriculture authorizing committee, in which the Appropriations Committee pledged, for the purpose of deficit reduction, to stay within the bounds of discretionary accounts and the Agriculture authorizing committee would in turn stay on the mandatory side of the ledger. This was a fair compromise. I am including a copy of that agreement for publication in the Record.  This bill before us today is a disappointing violation of the spirit and letter of that agreement. It's not only disappointing for what it will do to the policy reform efforts the Committee on Agriculture is attempting, but also for the precedent it sets for the next 7 years of budget deficit reduction efforts in the Congress.  This bill avoids the tough choices required in budget balancing and it is crafted using accounting gimmickry--the bill merely shifts funds from the mandatory side of the ledger over to the discretionary side--simply put: robbing Peter to pay Paul.  I have no doubts that this bill's supporters can make good justifications for every project and program in this document. Each probably has considerable merit. There is only one very troubling problem: each account that is maintained and increased is done so at the expense of farm commodity and conservation programs. At a time when the Agriculture Committee is laboring to reform outdated New Deal Era farm programs and help farmers and ranchers adapt to a market driven economy, cuts made to mandatory programs will cripple this effort by making it impossible for the Agriculture Committee to make necessary changes.  I am further opposed to this bill because it represents business as usual. First, and foremost, when the other body marked up the 1996 Agriculture Appropriations bill, they added $1.2 billion in spending over the House passed level. Conferees agreed to keep over $600 million of this amount in the bill before us today.  It should be instructive for my colleagues to look at what this bill before us does in terms of additional spending. The bottom line: we are spending $3.0 million more on special research grants at a time when there is a growing consensus that we should be putting more money into competitive research grants.  To this end we in the Agriculture Committee have been conducting an extensive review of the $1.7 billion we spend on agricultural research and extension each year. We have sent out an extensive set of questions to our Nation's agricultural research community and asked for their input on how to better direct limited research dollars. I believe this $1.7 billion can be spent in a more efficient manner and I will work with the Appropriations Committee next year to coordinate the overhaul of our Nation's research effort.  Equally disappointing is the House's capitulation to the Senate's spending on CSREES buildings and facilities account. Having no compunction about dipping into mandatory accounts to pay for these new university research buildings, the Senate decided it was critical to fund $57 million worth of new buildings.  No less alarming is the level spent in this bill for salaries and expense at the Consolidated Farm Services Agency and the Natural Resources Conservation Service agency; $1.5 billion, $1.5 billion to administer $7 billion worth of mandatory farm and conservation programs. That's 20 cents for every dollar spent on commodity and conservation programs. We can and should spend less in this area--taxpayers demand nothing less. The Appropriations Committee should look to this and other accounts like it next year before it comes over to the Agriculture Committee's mandatory accounts for its required savings.  The bottom line on this bill is truly found on its bottom line: it spends over $600 million more than the bill we in this body passed over 2 months ago. I urge my colleagues to reject this conference report.  I include for the Record a letter from Chairman Livingston to me, as follows:                                         House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Appropriations,                                    Washington, DC, July 13, 1995.     Hon. Pat Roberts,     Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, U.S. House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Roberts: This is to confirm the agreement      relating to budget responsibilities in future agriculture      appropriations and authorization legislation. We all      recognize the need to reform our budget process. A part of      that reform should be a review of both mandatory and      discretionary spending accounts. We further recognize that      there are gray areas--areas where appropriations reductions      to mandatory spending can advance our mutual policy and      deficit reduction goals.       However, as a general policy it is our intention that      beginning in FY 1997 all discretionary spending reductions      will be attributed to the Appropriations Committee, and all      mandatory spending reductions will be attributed to the      Agriculture Committee. Any future situation that deviates      from the general policy will require consultation and      agreement between the two committees. But as part of an      effort to move the FY 1996 Agriculture Appropriations Bill      through the House, this agreement will provide a clear basis      for managing the federal funds devoted to supporting farmers      and the rural sector as we move toward a balanced budget.           Sincerely,     Newt Gingrich,       Speaker.     John Kasich,       Chairman, Budget Committee.     Bob Livingston,       Chairman, Appropriations Committee.
