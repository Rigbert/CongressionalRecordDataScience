President, it is with great sadness that I rise today to inform the Senate of the tragic death of Dr. Rodney Belcher, an orthopedic surgeon from Arlington, VA, who was murdered in Kampala, Uganda, on March 13.  I was fortunate to have known Dr. Belcher. Seven years ago, shortly after I established the War Victims Fund, a $5 million appropriation in the foreign aid program to provide medical and related assistance to war victims, Rod Belcher signed on with Health Volunteers Overseas. He had lived in Uganda before the civil war there, and the Agency for International Development sent him back to start a War Victims Fund program to assist people who had been disabled from war injuries. He and his wife Dawn had been there ever since.  There were tens of thousands of amputees, many victims of landmines, without access to artificial limbs. The Mulagro hospital and medical school, once the pride and joy of that country, were in ruins. There were not even basic medical supplies. There was not a single trained orthopedic surgeon in the country. The Ugandan Government was bankrupt.  Rod embraced that enormous challenge with enthusiasm, good humor, patience, and a deep, personal commitment to the Ugandan people. Over the years he won the trust and respect of the Ugandan Government, and of successive United States Ambassadors and the ambassadors of other countries who witnessed the impact he was having on the lives of so many people. He rebuilt the orthopedic clinic and trained every orthopedic surgeon in Uganda today.  When my wife Marcelle and I visited Uganda in 1990, Dr. Belcher took us around the orthopedic clinic. We saw what a difference the War Victims Fund had made, as a result of his efforts and the efforts of the Ugandans who worked with him. It was an experience that neither of us will ever forget. We saw what a difference this one American had made.  Since then I have often thought of that trip, and Rod Belcher became the model for the volunteers that have been recruited for other War Victims Fund programs. He exemplified what we looked for in others. He had a warmth and gentleness, and a commitment to Uganda that was extraordinary.  Mr. President, on March 13, on his way to his office, Dr. Belcher was murdered when two men stole his car. He was shot in the chest and died right there.  It would be hard to conceive of a more senseless, horrible crime. Rod Belcher was a wonderfully generous human being who devoted his professional life to improving the lives of others. For the past 7 years he lived and worked in a country where getting even the simplest thing accomplished often required incredible ingenuity and persistence. Rod had both.  At his funeral, Dr. Belcher was honored by the Ugandan Vice President, the Minister of Health, the director of the hospital, the dean of the medical school, the American Ambassador, the British High Commissioner, and many others. The orthopedic clinic that he worked so hard to establish was formally named after him. The streets were lined with people who knew him personally or had heard of the American doctor who had done so much for the Ugandan people.  Rod Belcher will be terribly missed. But he leaves a legacy that anyone would be proud of. He gave the War Victims Fund its start, and for that I will always be grateful. And he leaves a core of trained Ugandan orthopedic surgeons who loved and admired him, who will carry on in his place.                          ____________________
