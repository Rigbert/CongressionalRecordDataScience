Speaker, I would like to thank the chief deputy whip, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Hill), not only for his extraordinary leadership on this mission to Israel and to visit with the leadership of the Palestinian authority, Mr. Abbas, but also I want to thank him for his being here this evening. I had intended to be here throughout the course of this special order, but the scheduling was such that I could not be. I thank the distinguished chief deputy whip from Indiana for standing in.  Mr. Speaker, no region of the world in my opinion holds out more promise and presents more peril than the Middle East. Our Nation's security is closely tied to the developments there, from our efforts in post-Hussein Iraq where 130,000 American troops are on the ground today, to our desire to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, to the continuing hunt for al Qaeda operatives, to the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian crisis.  The United States, Mr. Speaker, has interests and allies throughout the region but we have only, in my opinion, one true friend there, the democratic state of Israel. As President Kennedy remarked 40 years ago, he said this, ``We will never turn our back on our steadfast friends in Israel whose alliance to the democratic way must be admired by all friends of freedom.''  Today, Mr. Speaker, it is imperative that a new generation of American leaders recognize the special relationship that has developed between our two nations and understand why a free and secure Israel is vital to America's national security. Indeed, developing a deeper understanding of the U.S.-Israel bond was the purpose of a congressional delegation trip to Israel that I was pleased to lead from August 2 to August 10.  In all, Mr. Speaker, 29 House Democrats made this trip. That is the largest congressional delegation to visit Israel in its history. Our delegation included Representatives from every region of the United States, as well as the territory of Guam. More than one-third were serving their first year in Congress.                              {time}  1930  Nearly one-third were women, and for many this was their first visit to Israel.  This was my fourth trip to Israel as a Member of the House. I had been there before, and this was my sixth trip in all.  We made this long journey to see and to learn. We traveled throughout Israel, and visited the Gaza Strip and West Bank as well.  We were privileged to meet with Prime Minister Sharon and members of his cabinet; Labor Party chairman Peres, one of Israel's most distinguished statesman. We met also with Speaker Reuven Rivlin and members of the Knesset; and in addition to that, we met with the then-Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas, who sadly, subsequently, resigned after being continually undermined by the purveyors of death and destruction in his authority. He led, I think, an effort for peace, but that effort was subverted by Arafat himself.  We also, Mr. Speaker, were privileged to meet with representatives of the academic, religious, press, and medical communities. We saw firsthand the security challenges and realities that confront Israel and were left with several strong impressions.  First, security is an absolute precondition for peace. The much-discussed security fence was regarded as a reasonable attempt by our delegation to reduce terrorist attacks, and events, frankly, subsequent to our trip have not altered that view. However, Mr. Speaker, the route of that fence is an issue and properly continues to be examined.  Secondly, the dismantlement of the Palestinian terrorist organization, all of us believe, was essential if security was going to be effected, which is a precondition for peace, as I have said.  Thirdly, we cannot ignore, we must not ignore morally, politically, or intellectually the plight of the Palestinian people whose cause has been undermined, in my opinion, by the tactics of terror, the incitement to hate and refusal to seek peace.  Our trip, Mr. Speaker, occurred during a 7-week period of relative calm in that troubled part of the world; but that calm, as all of us know, was shattered on August 19, just a few days after we left, when a Hamas homicide bomber in Jerusalem murdered 22 people, including five Americans, and injured 130 others.  Since then, Mr. Abbas, as I said, has resigned. He resigned on September 6. A homicide bomber killed 19 people in Haifa last Saturday, and Israel retaliated 14 hours later by striking suspected terrorist camps inside Syria on the 30th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.  Mr. Speaker, it is clear that the continued, unconscionable violence by Palestinian terrorist organizations has left the President's so-called road map for peace in tatters.  I might say that I remember a conversation we had with Mr. Abbas, the prime minister then of the Palestinian Authority. It was on a Monday that we met with him. We met with him in Gaza, and he made the observation that there were thousands of Palestinians on the beach in Gaza enjoying a Sunday afternoon. He had said they had not done that in a very long time because they, too, like the Israelis, are concerned about security. They understand that terrorist attacks bring retaliation. They understand that the violence that the Palestinian terrorists perpetrate begets violence committed against them. The two, in my opinion, are not analogous. One is the cause of the other.  Mr. Speaker, we responded not only deep into the heart of Afghanistan when we thought that they were providing a haven and training ground for terrorists; we destroyed their government and replaced their government and drove them from the land. The Taliban, of course, is what I am talking about; but we know that if terrorism would stop, the chances for peace would escalate geometrically.  The Palestinian side must know the basic precondition for peace is and must be the unconditional cessation of the campaign of terror and violence against Israel. Not only does it undermine the security of Israel, but it undermines the security of the Palestinian people as well.  The United States, Mr. Speaker, stands ready, I believe this Congress stands ready, to work with other nations to obtain a better life for the Palestinian people; but this Nation will always be committed to Israel's survival, security and success as the haven and homeland for the Jewish people. No people on Earth perhaps has been more savaged through the centuries.  My friend, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), will speak in just a minute. African Americans unfortunately and tragically fall in a similar condition. For us to allow any peoples, whether they be Jewish, African American or Palestinians, to be savaged in a world that calls itself civilized is unacceptable.  We must call, therefore, we must urge, we must demand the cessation ofthe use of terrorism perpetrated against Israel, the United States, or any other nation. At the same time, we must seek justice, for without justice, as the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) knows so well, there will be no peace.                          ____________________
