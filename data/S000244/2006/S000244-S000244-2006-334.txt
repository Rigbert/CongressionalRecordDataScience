Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from California is right. This is an issue about papers. It is about a pretty important paper that has served our country well called the Constitution of the United States. Article I, section 7 says: ``All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives, but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills.  The ``comprehensive amnesty immigration bill'' that the Senate passed and didn't message contains $50 billion in new taxes. They ignore this sacred paper that has been the foundation of our government, and are we supposed to ignore that and thus subject anything they do to endless litigation because they deliberately violated the Constitution? I think not.  Mr. Speaker, I now yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Norwood).
