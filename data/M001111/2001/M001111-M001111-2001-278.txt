 President, I come to the floor today to submit a resolution in support of the Olympic Games, and in particular, in support of Olympic athletes.  The United States has a proud Olympic Games history. Thousands of Americans have represented our country at the Summer and Winter Games.  Numerous U.S. cities have hosted the Games. And cities all across our country hope to host the Olympic Games in the future just as Salt Lake City will host the Winter Games next year.  Let me share with my colleagues the story of one Olympian from my home state. Her name is Megan Quann.  Late last year, following the Sydney Summer Games, more than 1,000 people crowded the streets of Puyallup, Washington to see and to celebrate Megan Quann.  At the time, Megan was a 16-year-old junior at Emerald Ridge High School. She had just returned from Australia where she shocked the world by winning two Olympic Gold Medals in the swimming competition.  Megan's hometown was ecstatic. October 29 was officially declared ``Megan Quann'' day in Puyallup. She was honored through town in a parade that was led by local Cub Scouts, Brownies, and swimmers from a local club.  On that day, Megan's community erupted in pride in the accomplishments of a young athlete, a neighbor and a classmate.  It was a great day for Puyallup and for Washington state. Unfortunately, I was not there. But, like most of my constituents, I followed Megan at the Olympics, and I cheered as she set a new American record in one of her events.  And like all Americans, I was so proud of her as she stood on the medal stand--awestruck in her achievement--as the national anthem of our country played in the background.  Mr. President, I don't think any of us ever tire of seeing an American athlete being recognized as an Olympic champion.  We can't help but be moved when we see one of our own standing there--often with tears in their eyes--and the American flag on display for the whole world to see.  The Olympic Games can be an enormously patriotic experience for the athletes and all of us who watch the competitions. But the Olympics aren't just about patriotism. They are also about bringing different people together to share in competition.  Many Americans know the story of the Lithuanian basketball team which was embraced by the world following the collapse of the Soviet Union.  And, of course, the Jamaican bobsled team is famous for its efforts to compete in the Winter Games.  Time and again, we have seen Olympic athletes support each other in competition. They give their support freely, without consideration for nationality, religion, politics, or sex.  That devotion to sport is at the heart of the Olympic Movement worldwide and that celebration of sport is one reason why more than a thousand of my constituents came out to celebrate Megan Quann's achievements at the Sydney Olympic Games.  I have come to the floor to introduce a resolution which will hopefully ensure that another athlete like Megan can dedicate her life to the Olympic dream without the fear of seeing that dream die at the hands of political interference from the U.S. or elsewhere.  In working on this issue, I have reached out to Olympians. I am proud that in my own State, there are more than 180 Olympians, including 46 who competed at the Sydney Summer Games.  Nationwide, there are some 8,000 living Olympians, I appreciate the willingness of Washington's Olympians to review this resolution and to share their input.  And I appreciate the many other Olympians who have shared their views on the issues now before the United States Congress.  It is abundantly clear to me that U.S. Olympians do not want the Congress to mix politics with sport.  Most Olympians do not want the Congress to introduce or consider any legislation regarding the Olympic Games.  I agree with them. I too wish the Congress would not inject itself into the Olympic Movement.  Unfortunately, U.S. politicians have once again decided to mix politics with the Olympics. We only need to look back a short 20 years to see the painful and costly results of politicizing the Olympics.  In 1980, a generation of young Olympians did not get to participate in the Moscow Games due to the U.S. boycott.  More than 5,000 athletes--including more than 1,000 Americans--did not get to participate in the 1980 Moscow Summer Olympic Games.  Approximately 25 athletes from Washington state were barred from the 1980 Moscow Summer Games.  We have received strong support from this group of very special athletes, and I want to mention a few today.  I particularly want to thank Caroline Holmes. Caroline was a 1968 Olympic Gymnast. She is now the Chapter President of the Washington State Olympic Alumni Association. She is a champion for Olympic athletes, and I very much appreciate her assistance.  Jan Harville was a 1980 Olympian. She was on the rowing team. Today, she's the women's crew coach at the University of Washington. She's still very active with her fellow 1980 Olympians.  Paul Enquist from Seattle was also a rower on the 1980 team. Paul was able to compete and win a gold medal in the 1984 Los Angeles Games.  Matt Dryke was a skeet shooter on the 1980 team. Matt also went on to compete in later Olympic Games. In 1984, he won a Gold Medal.  Wendy Boglioli and Camille Wright were two swimmers on the 1980 team. Wendy ended her Olympic career when the U.S. boycotted Moscow.  Here's what Wendy had to say when asked about once again mixing politics with the Olympic Games:       It would be wrong for the Congress to interfere in the      Olympic site selection process. I was there in 1980.       I was one of 50 athletes invited to meet at the White House      with President Carter regarding the Moscow Olympics.       I am still upset that athletes had no voice in the 1980      decision. Mixing politics with the Olympics will only hurt      future athletes.  The 1980 Olympic Boycott was difficult for this country. Athletes sued the United States Olympic Community.  The Government threatened the U.S. Olympic Committee, and the President pressured other world leaders to join the U.S. led boycott.  Lost in the political squabble were U.S. athletes and for some, a lifetime of commitment and preparation.  The Soviets, as we know, boycotted the 1984 Los Angeles Games. And again, the athletes were the victims. Consider this fact: In the 1980 Moscow Games, the East German team won the women's 4 by 100 relay race with a time of 41.60 seconds.  At the 1984 Los Angeles Games, the US team won the same relay race with a time of 41.65 seconds. The U.S. and East German teams were within five one-hundredths of a second.  Knowing all of this, I wish these two great Olympic champion relay teamscould have competed against one another in Olympic competition. It is a sad part of our history that politicians kept this great race from happening in the Olympics.  With the benefit of history, we know that the Olympic boycotts were futile and ineffective attempts to settle cold war disputes.  I believe we should do absolutely all that we can to ensure this never happens again.  No one can foretell the future and what actions might be called for to protect our country's national interest, but we should never again lose sight of the interests of our athletes.  Unfortunately, Members of Congress are politicizing the Olympic Games. My resolution has one primary objective--to separate politics from sport and particularly from the Olympic Games. Simply put, I believe politics has no place in the dreams of future Olympians.  I want to thank Senator Ted Stevens for joining me in this effort. Senator Stevens has a long history of involvement with the Olympic Movement.  I am not aware of another elected official in this country who has done more for U.S. athletes than Senator Stevens. And I thank the Senator for once again standing up for the interests of U.S. athletes.  The Murray/Stevens resolution on the Olympics has a number of key provisions and clauses. However, I want to focus on three sections which represent the real intent of our bill.  First, our resolution encourages members of the International Olympic Committee to abide by all rules of the IOC when considering and voting for host cities for future Olympic Games.  Members of the IOC take an oath which requires individual members to keep free from political influence.  Our resolution calls upon the four members of the International Olympic Committee from the United States to reject all political influences on their work as members of the IOC, including their votes on host cities for future Olympic Games.  Second, our resolution recognizes that any government action designating a preference or displeasure with any Olympic Games host city is inconsistent with the IOC's Charter, Code of Ethics and rules.  Essentially, this provision says the IOC should not acknowledge or consider any political interference in the host city selection process for future Olympic Games.  And finally, our resolution says the Olympic Games are about the athletes, that we do endorse the concept that the Olympic Games are a competition between athletes in individual and team events and not between countries.  We believe the Olympic Games are best left to the athletes. It is that simple.  I encourage my colleagues to consider this issue carefully in the days ahead. And I invite all Senators to join me in seeking to reject political interference in the Olympic Movement.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
