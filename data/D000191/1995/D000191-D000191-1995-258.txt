Speaker, let me start by saying I am not an attorney. I am one of probably a minority in this Congress who is not an attorney.  But I have taken recourse to the courts. I live in the Pacific Northwest. When a scam was run on the Northwest called WPPSS, Washington Public Power Supply System, that promised us five nuclear powerplants to produce power without cost for only $4 billion, and it ultimately cost $10 billion, and all but one was never completed.  I launched a ratepayer lawsuit in court. On the other side of the courtroom were a couple of hundred lawyers.  Now, under this bill, ratepayers will not be suing anymore because they will have to pay for those 200 high-priced corporate lawyers on the other side of the room. I have 1 lawyer, a local guy, pro bono, me, and 26 other citizens. That will not happen anymore under the Republican view of what is wrong with the legal system in America.  There are problems, and the American people are frustrated, but they have perverted that frustration into a bill that is an abomination. The Republican spinmeisters have worked overtime for this week's production, and it is a production. They pretend this is a relief for Main Street America, for people who are overburdened by litigation. But with breathtaking bait-and-switch, they produced a bill beyond the dreams of the most corrupt corporate swindlers in this country.  It is payback and payoff time, America.  First we have the Corporate Intimidation Act. I have already explained that. It is called loser pays. If the ratepayer wants to go to court and sue a multi-billion-dollar corporation: ``Hey, check your checkbook. If you can afford to pay for all the lawyers they trot into the court, go right ahead.'' I do not think there will be too many lawsuits filed by ratepayers anymore, but maybe that is the objective of this proposed bill.  It is also a blank check for bunco artists. We know that Wall Street is suffering. They are suffering because of litigation, those poor people on Wall Street, those poor thousand-dollar-an-hour poor lawyers. You know, it is tough.  Well, they have a new defense now, and it is called, ``I forget.'' And under this bill, the one coming up on Wednesday, they can say, ``Well, gee, we would have disclosed those defects in our prospectus for you, but I forget.'' So, hire a thousand-dollar lawyer; he forgot. That is now a defense.  But this is for Main Street America, remember that, this is for Main Street America. Sure, it is for Main Street America. Who buys those securities, who gets defrauded? There will not be another Charles Keating under this bill, thank God there will not be another Charles Keating defrauding the taxpayers of millions of dollars. It will not prevent the fraud, but it will prevent the litigation against Charles Keating. That is great. That resolves the problem with the legal system in America.  This is just what main street needs at a time of the bankruptcy of Orange County, the Barings Bank, speculation going on wildly. When your IRA disappears or your little pension plan, because of a bunco artist, don't worry, you will not be able to go to court anymore. That is what this bill is all about.  Finally, we have the tort reform. We have heard a lot of States rights from that side of the aisle. This will take States rights and rip it into shreds; 200 years of State precedents in tort reform will be overruled by the Federal Government only when it protects corporate interests.  You know, there will be a 15-year ban on litigation to get any product, any product, unless a business is harmed, so they will be able to go in and sue for commercial losses. Your wife, husband, mother, son, is killed by a defective product? After 15 years, tough luck. Your company loses some money with the defective product, after 15 years? Welcome to court.  This is for Main Street America? No, it is not for Main Street America. This has one very simple thing underlying it. It used to be that all men and women were equal before the law. Under the new Republican proposal, all dollars are equal before the law, and the corporations have a lot more of them than we do. That is what this is all about, in, many, many ways that are yet to be told. Watch the debate this week, listen, pick up the covers, look underneath. This is not for main street. It is for Wall Street.                          ____________________
