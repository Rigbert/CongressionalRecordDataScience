Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Frank amendment. I have heard from hundreds of Rhode Islanders who are concerned about the repeal of the Brooke amendment. While I commend Chairman Lazio's amendment which aims to improve his original provision regarding rent payments, I believe that we need to do more to protect those Americans who relay on public and assisted housing.  Our Nation's low-income residents are already coping with drastic cuts in funding for many important programs. Rhode Island's seniors, disabled, and low-income families are already forced to make many choices between the bare necessities of life that Members of Congress do not face. The Frank amendment will allow these people to live in decent, affordable housing and still provide for their food, clothing, and medicine. Simply put, increasing rents for our Nation's most vulnerable will not achieve the goal of ``empowering'' our citizens. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to provide real help to our Nation's elderly, disabled persons, children, and low-income residents. Support the Frank amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Frank amendment. I have heard from hundreds of Rhode Islanders who are concerned about the repeal of the Brooke amendment. While I commend Chairman Lazio's amendment which aims to improve his original provision regarding rent payments, I believe that we need to do more to protect those Americans who rely on public and assisted housing.  We need to ensure reasonable rents for our Nation's seniors, disabled persons, and low-income families so that they can live in safe decent and affordable housing. Our Nation's low-income residents are already coping with drastic cuts in funding for many important programs, and now we are contemplating penalizing those who may find themselves in need of public housing in the future whose incomes fall below 50 percent of the median income level.  Rhode Island's seniors and disabled are already forced to make many choices between the bare necessities of life that Members of Congress do not face. The Brooke amendment has allowed these people to live in decent, affordable housing and still provide for their food, clothing, and medicine. Simply put, increasing rents for our Nation's most vulnerable will not achieve the goal of ``empowering'' our citizens. Rather, it could force many of these people deeper into poverty.  In Rhode Island, the Brooke amendment matters. In Rhode Island, 25,100 households fall under the Brooke amendment, and not all of them live in public housing. The Brooke amendment matters because 11,400 of these households including children that need to be fed, clothed, and educated. The Brooke amendment matters because the Providence housing market lost some 1,100 units of affordable housing from 1988 to 1992. Regrettably, the bill we are now considering will only exacerbate the problems of those struggling and older Rhode Islanders who desperately need the Brooke amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to provide real help to our Nation's elderly, disabledpersons, children, and low-income residents. Support the Frank amendment.                              {time}  1145
