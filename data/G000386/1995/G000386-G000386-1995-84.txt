 President, earlier this year, Congress overwhelmingly passed the Congressional Accountability Act which was signed into law by the President. The purpose of the act was to clarify that we cannot pass laws applying to the private sector that do not apply to us as well.  After many years of pursuing this legislative initiative, I was pleased with the final outcome of the act.  A concern has been raised that the welfare bill before us today is not clear on the issue of congressional coverage.  If the leader would indulge me, I would like to enter into a colloquy addressing this concern.  Mr. Leader, is it the intent of the legislation in section 453(a) of title 9, the child support enforcement title of the bill, to include Senators and Congressmen in the definition of ``any governmental entity''?
