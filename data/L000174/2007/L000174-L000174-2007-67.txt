President, today I introduce legislation to create Federal Rule of Evidence 502. I am pleased that Senator Specter has joined me in thiseffort. After much study, several hearings, and significant public comment, the Judicial Conference's Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, and the Advisory Committee on Evidence Rules, arrived at a proposed new rule that is intended to provide predictability and uniformity in a discovery process that has been made increasingly difficult with the growing use of email and other electronic media. I commend all of the judges, professors and practitioners who were involved in the rule's drafting and subsequent improvement for their hard work and attention to this issue. The legislation we are introducing today contains the text that the Judicial Conference recommends.  Billions of dollars are spent each year in litigation to protect against the inadvertent disclosure of privileged materials. With the routine use of email and other electronic media in today's business environment, discovery can encompass millions of documents in a given case, vastly expanding the risks of inadvertent disclosure. The rule proposed by the Standing Committee is aimed at adapting to the new realities that accompany today's modes of communication, and reducing the burdens associated with the conduct of diligent electronic discovery.  Our proposed legislation would set clear guidelines regarding the consequences of inadvertent disclosure of privileged material, and provides that so long as reasonable steps are taken in the prevention of such a disclosure, or to assure the prompt retrieval of disclosed information, no waiver will result. Moreover, an inadvertent disclosure of privileged information would not result in a broader subject matter waiver beyond the specific materials disclosed.  If a disclosure of privileged material is made voluntarily, only the privilege associated with the voluntarily disclosed material is waived, and not other undisclosed related materials. But if voluntary disclosure of privileged material is done selectively in an effort to mislead or gain unfair advantage, then where fairness dictates, this will result in a subject matter waiver.  This legislation would also provide that confidentiality agreements entered into by parties to litigation, and approved by the court, will bind all non-parties in other State or Federal litigation. This provision will add meaningful protection to parties entering confidentiality agreements and, along with other components of the proposed rule, will aid in reducing the burdens of excessive pre-production document review.  Unlike other Federal court rules, any proposed rule that modifies an evidentiary privilege must be approved by Congress pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act. The modification of a privilege is an undertaking not to be approached lightly, and the process that resulted in proposed Rule 502 was thorough and thoughtful. It has resulted in widespread approval of the proposed rule from the bench and bar at both the State and Federal level.  I urge all Senators to join Senator Specter and me to pass this proposal and take a positive step toward modernizing and improving the Federal Rules of Evidence.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2450       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE AND WORK PRODUCT;                    LIMITATIONS ON WAIVER.       (a) In General.--Article V of the Federal Rules of Evidence      is amended by adding at the end the following:     ``Rule 502. Attorney-Client Privilege and Work Product;        Limitations on Waiver       ``The following provisions apply, in the circumstances set      out, to disclosure of a communication or information covered      by the attorney-client privilege or work-product protection.       ``(a) Disclosure Made in a Federal Proceeding or to a      Federal Office or Agency; Scope of a Waiver.--When the      disclosure is made in a federal proceeding or to a federal      office or agency and waives the attorney-client privilege or      work-product protection, the waiver extends to an undisclosed      communication or information in a federal or state proceeding      only if:       ``(1) the waiver is intentional;       ``(2) the disclosed and undisclosed communications or      information concern the same subject matter; and       ``(3) they ought in fairness to be considered together.       ``(b) Inadvertent Disclosure.--When made in a federal      proceeding or to a federal office or agency, the disclosure      does not operate as a waiver in a federal or state proceeding      if:       ``(1) the disclosure is inadvertent;       ``(2) the holder of the privilege or protection took      reasonable steps to prevent disclosure; and       ``(3) the holder promptly took reasonable steps to rectify      the error, including (if applicable) following Federal Rule      of Civil Procedure 26(b)(5)(B).       ``(c) Disclosure Made in a State Proceeding.--When the      disclosure is made in a state proceeding and is not the      subject of a state-court order concerning waiver, the      disclosure does not operate as a waiver in a federal      proceeding if the disclosure:       ``(1) would not be a waiver under this rule if it had been      made in a federal proceeding; or       ``(2) is not a waiver under the law of the state where the      disclosure occurred.       ``(d) Controlling Effect of a Court Order.--A federal court      may order that the privilege or protection is not waived by      disclosure connected with the litigation pending before the      court--in which event the disclosure is also not a waiver in      any other federal or state proceeding.       ``(e) Controlling Effect of a Party Agreement.--An      agreement on the effect of disclosure in a federal proceeding      is binding only on the parties to the agreement, unless it is      incorporated into a court order.       ``(f)  Controlling Effect of This Rule.--Notwithstanding      Rules 101 and 1101, this rule applies to state proceedings      and to federal court-annexed and federal court-mandated      arbitration proceedings, in the circumstances set out in the      rule. And notwithstanding Rule 501, this rule applies even if      state law provides the rule of decision.       ``(g) Definitions.--In this rule:       ``(1) `attorney-client privilege' means the protection that      applicable law provides for confidential attorney-client      communications; and       ``(2) `work-product protection' means the protection that      applicable law provides for tangible material (or its      intangible equivalent) prepared in anticipation of litigation      or for trial.''.       (b) Technical and Conforming Changes.--The table of      contents for the Federal Rules of Evidence is amended by      inserting after the item relating to rule 501 the following:``502. Attorney-client privilege and work-product doctrine; limitations               on waiver.''.       (c) Effective date.--The amendments made by this Act shall      apply in all proceedings commenced after the date of      enactment of this Act and, insofar as is just and      practicable, in all proceedings pending on such date of      enactment.
