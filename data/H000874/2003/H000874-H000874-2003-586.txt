Speaker, I rise today to recognize two faculty members of the College of Southern Maryland who have been honored by the Association of Community College Trustees. Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Elaine Ryan, is the recipient of the 2003 Chief Executive Officer Award and Professor Bill Morton is the recipient of the 2003 Faculty Member Award.  Mr. Speaker, the ACCT awards program is very competitive at a national level. This program annually recognizes the contributions made by trustees, chief executives and faculty members. The association is a non-profit educational organization of governing boards, representing more than 6,500 elected and appointed trustees.  Being selected the recipient of the 2003 Chief Executive Officer award is a great honor and privilege. Dr. Ryan has devoted over thirty years to the College of Southern Maryland and in 1998, was appointed the college's third president. She is the first female to hold such responsibility at this college. Under her leadership, the community college has become a regional institution serving three counties with four campuses. According to the 2003 Maryland Higher Education Commission Report on Retention, Transfer and Graduation Rates, the College of Southern Maryland ranked first in the State for the highest four-year graduation and transfer rates among Maryland community colleges for its first-time, full-time entering freshman class of 1998. This is a significant achievement for the college. Dr. Ryan, as CEO, no doubt has had a very active part in making the college as successful as it is today. She is admired and respected for her administrative ability, intellect, and love of her community. She is very active in her community serving on the Governor's Information Technology Board, the Southern Maryland Workforce Investment Board, the Charles County's Vision in Teamwork and Leadership organization and the Board of Directors for the Maryland Mentoring Partnerships, as well as many other community organizations. She is a role model for many young people in the community and has been nationally recognized for her efforts in education.  No college can be successful without the intelligent and caring men and women who strive everyday to make a difference in the lives of today's youth. Having professors who love to teach students is what makes a college the best that it can be. Professor Bill Morton has been recognized by the ACCT for his innovative instruction in accounting, economics and management. He is a pioneer in his field, utilizing distance learning through broadcast and video-based telecourses, interactive television, online courses, and cooperative education. He has devoted thirteen years to educating youth at the College of Southern Maryland. He believes that the only way to teach students is to reach students. Morton integrates his own life lessons into his teachings by drawing on his fifteen years of military and private sector experience. In 2000, the Association of Collegiate Business Schools and Programs (Region 2) awarded Morton the Teaching Excellence Award. For the past two years, the faculty at CSM selected the professor to receive the Faculty Excellence Award. Morton's expertise in his subject, positive attitude toward his students, and passion for teaching draw admiration from his peers and pupils alike.  On this day, I would like to recognize these individuals for their achievements in the field of education. Teaching is one of the most important professions in our Nation today and it is important to recognize those outstanding teachers for educating our Nation's youth and inspiring them to succeed in life. Dr. Elaine Ryan and Professor Bill Morton have worked hard to achieve this outstanding award presented by the ACCT. Their dedicated service to the College of Southern Maryland, to their profession and to their community has benefited and enriched the lives of so many. Southern Maryland is fortunate to have such committed professionals and we all thank and congratulate them for a job well done.                          ____________________
