 President, on March 18th there will be a retirement party in Shueyville, IA for one of Iowa's most highly-regarded journalists.  Ken Sullivan left The Cedar Rapids Gazette on February 10th, after 36\1/2\ years on the job. He started his career as a radio news reporter a few months after high school and reported for the Oelwein Daily Register for three years before joining Iowa's second-largest newspaper.  I have known Ken as one of the leading political reporters in a state where political dialogue is healthy and rigorous. Ken's many years of public service have greatly enriched this political landscape, as well as the civic life of metropolitan Cedar Rapids. He brought to his work tremendous dedication and demonstrated through his commentary the common sense and independence that characterizes the people of Iowa.  Mr. President, I salute the contribution that Ken Sullivan has made to our democracy by letting the sun shine in to the processes of government and encouraging public dialogue on the issues through his news reports, editorials and columns. His keen insights and energetic coverage of the issues important to Iowa and the country have well-served his readers and the public good. He will be missed, and I congratulate him on his many years of fine service.                          ____________________
