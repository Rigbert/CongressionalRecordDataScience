There may be some difficulty with some of the amendments coming down. I urge Senators who have amendments, even if we have to put a couple aside, that they come down and start debating their amendments.  I think I can speak for both the distinguished chairman and myself on the pending amendment. There will be no difficulty in having it set aside for the moment if somebody wants to start debate on another amendment, especially if it is going to require a rollcall vote. I can see a situation where it can easily be sequenced following these other two amendments.  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Vermont, as we speak, staff onboth sides are going over the amendments that were filed prior to the deadline of 3 p.m. Hopefully, we will be able to process some of those by agreement during this period between now and 6:10 p.m. I agree with the Senator from Vermont, we want to make progress. If anybody wants to come down and offer an amendment that might be contentious and debate it, we will certainly be glad to see them.
