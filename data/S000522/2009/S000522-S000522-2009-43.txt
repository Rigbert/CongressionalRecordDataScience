Eleven different elections overseas, usually as the head of the delegation. And we're trying to inculcate those kind of values and to say to our partners, learn from the Helsinki process. It works. It has yielded tremendous results and progress in the area of human rights. And so I want to, again, thank him for his work and again for this resolution.  I'd also like to welcome the President of the Parliamentary Assembly, Joao Soares, as well as Goran Lenmarker, who is the immediate past President of the Parliamentary Assembly; Jerry Grafstein, our good friend from Canada, who's also here, who has done yeoman's work again.  Everybody knows about NATO, Mr. Speaker. They don't necessarily, at least in the United States, know about the good work that the OSCE has done all these years. The Parliamentary Assembly was formed in the early 1990s to be, really, the voice of Members of Parliament and Congresses around the 56 countries that make up the OSCE. And we have really become friends. I was Chairman of the Helsinki Commission for 12 years. I've been on it since my second term in 1983, and now serve as ranking member. And Mr. Hastings and Ben Cardin are serving as co-chairs. This is a remarkable organization that, again, far too few people know the contributions that it makes, particularly in the area of human rights.  So again, I want to thank Mr. Hastings and wish him great success with the conference that's underway, but especially for the hard work and very under-appreciated work in reaching out to those partners in the Mediterranean to say, learn from the OSCE and maybe even provides some insights also as to how we can improve our work as well.
