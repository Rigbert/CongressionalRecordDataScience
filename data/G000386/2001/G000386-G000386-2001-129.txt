 There are 42 million uninsured now. Do we want to increase that? No, nobody wants to increase that, but that is going to be the end result when these self-insured plans are dropped. Then, of course, the employees become the biggest losers in this lottery.  So I urge my colleagues to reject this lottery and to support the Bond amendment, which creates much needed patient minimums and ensures that patients, not lawyers, get fair compensation for their losses.  I reserve the remainder of the time and yield the floor.
