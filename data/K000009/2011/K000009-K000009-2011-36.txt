You are absolutely unrelenting, and that's the spirit that is America, so we thank you for your time tonight.  And Congressman Tonko of New York, your steadfast service here in representing a State that has some similar situations to Ohio's in the industrial and agricultural heartland of our country. It's really a special privilege to be here tonight with both of you.  This morning, one of my first visits was with a company in Avon Lake, Ohio, PolyOne. This is a company that makes products in America. Yes, it's a global player, but its innovation center is in Ohio. Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of jobs are associated with its plastic products, made both out of traditional petroleum-based inputs as well as the new carbohydrate economy that you can see developing, and it was really quite exciting.  We know that real wealth is created in our country when we make goods in America, when we make it in America. I think the problem over the last several years has been that if you travel to any city in America and you look at the tallest building, what are they? Are they the firms making things or are they merely, as I saw in Michigan recently, a gigantic bank whose headquarters is on Wall Street, a bank that just got bailed out by the American people?  I stopped my car and I looked at that building, and then I looked at the devastation of the communities around that particular part of Michigan, and I thought, what's wrong with this picture? Basically, this institution has sucked up the wealth of neighborhood after neighborhood and left rubble in its way.  They're not being held accountable. Yet I see companies like PolyOne trying to make it in a global economy with a very unfair set of trade practices--closed markets around the world, currency manipulation, intellectual property theft.                              {time}  2010  I look at what's happening with competitors, with competition to U.S. industry, and you have to say to those patriots who are making goods in America, we stand with you. We should be rewarding those companies. We should be making more goods in our country.  I wanted to just add a word about the automotive industry. There were those in this Chamber that voted against the refinancing of the automotive industry. Without that industry, this country would not have a defense base, and we would not be a great industrial power. And now I see in our region of the country--I was just at Chrysler Fiat. They announced billions of dollars of investment. There's going to be over a thousand more people hired at their main production facility in Toledo, Ohio. Chrysler Jeep makes the Wrangler and the Liberty and likely vehicles that will follow on.  The feeling inside that plant of people who have given their lives to keeping America competitive and to manufacturing a label that is known throughout the world, it was a wonderful day to be there. And I was reminded, and I said very frankly, You know, there were 170 Members of Congress that didn't think you should be here and didn't think that this company should be here. And the company has paid back the loan that was made, and now we're going to have good jobs by making goods in America. So I wanted to share those experiences.  I feel bad that we have a country where certain financial firms that have, totally speculative, have brought us to this point. But I stand with those who have weathered the storm and who are now hiring and trying to move this economy back where we know it can be.  I was very proud to be a Member, as are those who are here with us tonight, to vote for that refinancing of the automotive industry and with its procurement from suppliers--whether it's plastics, whether it's glass, whether it's fibre, whether it's textiles, whatever, that's helping to lift this economy to where last week, on the day after Thanksgiving, retail sales in our country went up about 16.7 percent, I guess. It shows that people have more spending power. That's what we should be doing. We should be using our power here to lift those industries that can really make goods in our country and help recreate a strengthened middle class.
