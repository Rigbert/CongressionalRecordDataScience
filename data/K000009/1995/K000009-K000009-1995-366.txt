Speaker, I rise today to honor the birthdate of a genuine American hero, Cesar Chavez, which is on Friday, March 31. It is hard to summarize the accomplishments and impact of those citizens whose work not only changes the nature of the world in which they lived--but extends beyond their natural lives into the lives of those who will only know them by their legacy.  Just as every African-American citizen feels the impact of Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy in their lives, every Hispanic citizen, especially those who work the farms, fruit orchards and vegetable fields of America, will feel the impact of the life of Cesar Chavez.  Before Cesar, America's migrant workers had few rights. He became their voice and the force that fought for basic human liberties and labor rights.  When Cesar died he left a legacy to be emulated by future generations and the lessons learned will resonate for years to come. A legacy that will make migrant workers a full partner in the agricultural industry, and bring them to full membership in our society with all the benefits that full membership implies.  Ever so slowly, migrant workers are entering into the mainstream of our society and into a status for which they have long aspired and is [[Page E745]] long overdue. Cesar's dream is moving towards reality. Whether it be by increasing education, work and training opportunities; continuing the fight to grain a liveable wage, benefits, and working conditions; or guaranteeing their access to full citizenship and the right to have their grievance addressed by whether legal means available.  As we move forward as a community towards ensuring equal opportunity, equal protections and equal membership for all peoples in our society, let us remember the contributions of one of the greatest teachers on the means and importance of this pursuit--Cesar Chavez.                          ____________________
