 Speaker, like all of us who live in Vermont, and many millions across the nation, I was thrilled when the underdog Catamounts of the University of Vermont defeated Syracuse in the opening round of the 2005 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament. Syracuse was a national power; the nucleus of its team won the national championship two years earlier. Its players were accomplished, well-coached and a credit to college basketball.  But the University of Vermont team rose to the challenge, coming from behind in the final minutes of both regulation play and overtime. Led by the greatest basketball player to come out of Vermont, Taylor Coppenrath of West Barnet, Vermont the Catamounts showed how teamwork and a tenacious defense could elevate a team to national prominence. During the regular season Coppenrath was the second leading Division I scorer in the nation with 25.7 points per game, and for the third straight year he was the player of the year in the America East conference. He was joined on the team by T. J. Sorrentine, a sharp-shooting point guard (fifth in the nation with 3.6 three-point field goals per game) whose passion and precision shooting define the Catamounts. He too has been an America East player of the year and has three first-team selections to his credit. The international contingent made up of Germain Mopa Njila of Cameroon, whose career scoring high of 20 points on 9 of 10 shooting was the mainstay of the Catamount offense against Syracuse; Martin Klimes of the Czech Republic, whose smothering defense held All-American Hakim Warrick in check, and Canadian David Hehn, who selflessly threw himself into the Cats' tight defense and patient and exceptionally effective passing game.  It was talent and tenacity. All five Vermont starters played at least 40 minutes, and Klimes and Coppenrath never had a rest on the bench at all. The Catamounts stuck with a game plan devised by Coach Tom Brennan and Associate Head Coach Jesse Agel, which called for ball control, constant passing and careful work against Syracuse's famed 2-3 zone until a shot opened up.  No one should be surprised that they show poised intelligence on the hardwood. The UVM basketball team had a 3.09 grade point average (GPA) for the fall semester. The starting five has a cumulative GPA, including all the courses the players have taken in their time at UVM, above 3.0. This is an exceptionally high and rare statistic for basketball teams that play at the highest level, some of which graduate less than half their teams members. Martin Klimes, majoring in business, has a 3.82 GPA, one of the highest averages in his entire college. Geramin Mopa Njila, a computer science and information systems major, has a GPA of 3.21. Sociology major T.J. Sorrentine averages 2.75, while David Hehn has a stellar 3.57 GPA in business. Wooden Award finalist Taylor Coppenrath averaged 2.80 in secondary education and competed at the elite level in basketball, while student teaching in the math department at Colchester High School.  Their academic performance is exceptional for UVM athletes. The state university is as dedicated to graduating student athletes as it is to fielding fine teams (its men's hockey team recently played in the ECAC Final Four, and its ski team was second in the nation at the NCAA national championships). The overall GPA for student athletes is 3.08, which is higher than the GPA for the student body as a whole.  The Catamounts captured the attention and the heart of the entire nation. To the wonderful, inspired members of that team, and their dedicated coaches, the state of Vermont sends its salutations. Perhaps no one can say it better than their retiring coach, Tom Brennan, who said these words after losing to Michigan State in the second round, ``We can't thank everyone enough on what the support has meant to us. We gave more back than what we took and what we did this weekend was the thrill of a lifetime. It was the greatest ride that I could ever, ever have had. You know you're in a very special place when your realities outweigh your dreams. And that's where I am.'' For all of us in Vermont, for one special night, reality did outweigh dreams. Thanks, Catamounts.                          ____________________
