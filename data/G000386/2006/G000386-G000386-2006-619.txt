 President, I hope every taxpayer in this country knows that what they heard was a philosophy that every dollar you make belongs to the Government, and we are going to let you keep a little bit of it.  We kept hearing about tax cuts costing us, tax cuts costing us. If we give you a tax cut, it is costing us in Government, and we can't do as much for you as if we tax you more.  So there is a basic philosophy behind this legislation whether we ought to let tax cuts stay in the pockets of Americans and let them spend it and do the economic good and let the marketplace decide how the goods and services in this country be divided or whether we ought to tax at a higher rate and bring it to Washington and let a few politicians make a decision on how to spend it.  I opt for trusting the American people with how they spend their money and the growth that comes from the investment that creates jobs that causes our economy to expand.  I will have more to say about some of the other speakers who have been inopposition to this bill as soon as the Senator from New Hampshire concludes. I wanted to make that point before my good friend got out of here because a lot of times he never gets a chance to hear what I say, and I wanted to make sure he heard it.  I yield whatever time he might consume to the Senator from New Hampshire.
