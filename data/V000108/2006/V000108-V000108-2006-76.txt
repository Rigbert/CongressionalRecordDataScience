Speaker, it is with great honor and pleasure that I stand before you today to recognize the many accomplishments of Mr. John Silhavy. I have known John for many years, and he is one of the most involved citizens I have ever known, especially when it comes to his service to the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM & AW). John has been a member of the IAM & AW for an astounding 45 years, and his contributions to the organization are immeasurable. Though John has been a constant fixture within the organization, he will be retiring from the IAM & AW at year's end. For his efforts and many contributions to the union, John will be honored at a retirement celebration on Saturday, December 9, 2006, at the IAM & AW Local Lodge 1227 in Valparaiso, Indiana.  John Silhavy was born in Valparniso, Indiana in 1943 and grew up on a farm with his two brothers and two sisters. After graduating from the Valparaiso. School System in 1961, he joined the IAM while working for McGill Manufacturing. John's service as an elected member of the union began in 1965, when he was elected Union Steward in the external grinding department. From there, John's dedication to the union and its members continued as he was elected Vice President of Local Lodge 1227 in 1969. With John's commitment to serve, it is only fitting that in 1971, John was elected President of Local Lodge 1227, a position he would hold for an astonishing 23 years. Equally impressive, John also served as a member of the Bargaining Committee from 1970 to 1994.  Aside from his service to the local lodge, John also held many posts with District Lodge 72, a further demonstration of his commitment to the union and its membership. From 1976 to 1994, John served as a Delegate of the Lodge. The respect and trust the union's members have for John has never been questioned, and evidence of this can clearly be seen in the fact that John also was elected to serve as Trustee, Vice-President, and of course, President of District Lodge 72. John held this distinguished position until 1994, when he was elected to the position of Business Representative for District Lodge 90. Since then, John's service has continued, and in 1999, he was elected to his current position, Directing Business Representative for District Lodge 90, a post he will vacate through his retirement on December 31, 2006. Also important to note, in 1996, John served on the IAM Blue Ribbon Commission, which was established with the goal of finding ways to improve the IAM on a national level. John's knowledge of the union and his field, along with his willingness to serve, has made him one of the most well-respected individuals the union has ever seen. His daily presence will surely be missed.  When not engaged within the union, John spends his spare time with those closest to him, his family. A loving husband, father, and grandfather, John's commitment to the union and its members is surpassed only by his dedication to his family. John and his wife, Carolyn, have shared many wonderful years together. They have been blessed with two daughters, Tina and Tammy, and John's stepsons, Robert and James. John and Carolyn are also the proud grandparents of James, Jason, Joel, and Jordan.  Mr. Speaker, John Silhavy has given his time and efforts selflessly to the members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers for the past 45 years. At this time, I ask that you and all of my distinguished colleagues join me in commending him for his lifetime of service and dedication.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E2056]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                        TRIBUTE TO JOHN SILHAVY                                 ______                                                         HON.
