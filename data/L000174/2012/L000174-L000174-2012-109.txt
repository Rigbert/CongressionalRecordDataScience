President, the distinguished gentleman from Oklahoma has noted his objection, and I appreciate him doing that, but I would also note that we share different views on this. For example, the Senator from Oklahoma was the lone vote opposing the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2012. The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program has saved the lives of hundreds and even thousands of our police officers. He opposes the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Act, which provides a Federal death benefit to surviving families of first responders who are killed in the line of duty. And he is objecting to the passage of the bipartisan, bicameral, and cost-neutral Public Safety Officers' Benefits Improvements Act of 2012, which would make important reforms to a program that has assisted the families of thousands of police officers and other first responders who have lost their lives protecting their communities and fellow citizens.  During the months when we were trying to pass the Public Safety Officers' Benefits legislation, we heard from Chuck Canterbury, the highly respected president of the Fraternal Order of Police. He is one of our Nation's law enforcement leaders. He wrote to the chairs of both the Senate and House Judiciary Committees about the distinguished Senator's opposition to this cost-neutral Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program reform, and he concluded:       The FOP views this not as a politician embracing the      principle of federalism, but as a . . . ploy to place even      greater strain between law enforcement and other public      safety officers that serve on the local and State level and      their colleagues employed by the Federal government. When a      police officer puts himself in harm's way, he does not stop      to think about jurisdiction. He does not ask the offender if      he is committing a local, State, or Federal crime. He acts in      the best interest of the safety of those he swore to protect.      A family that loses a loved one in the line of duty should      not just be left adrift, their sacrifice ignored because      their loved one was a local firefighter or State Trooper and      not a Federal agent.  I hope the Senate will overwhelmingly pass this bipartisan piece of legislation. We have always supported our first responders. I think back to my own experience in law enforcement and also the experience of former Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell from Colorado, who I joined to write legislation, based upon his experience in the sheriff's department in Colorado, and my experience as a prosecutor, to provide assistance to state and local law enforcement to obtain bulletproof vests. The amendment we consider today is in that same spirit. Anybody who served in law enforcement, anybody who served as a volunteer firefighter or emergency medical responder, anybody in any part of this country who serves in these capacities knows the need for this. The fact that we have been able to improve the existing law, with no cost to the taxpayer, is even better.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters from the Congressional Fire Services Institute, International Association of Fire Chiefs, International Association of Fire Fighters, National Fire Protection Association, National Volunteer Fire Council, and the American Ambulance Association in support of this legislation.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                November 28, 2012.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy: We are writing to express support for      S.A. 2955, which would amend S. 3254, the National Defense      Authorization Act to include language from the Public Safety      Officers' Benefits Improvements Act (PSOBIA). As you know,      the Public Safety Officers' Benefits (PSOB) program provides      critical assistance to the families of public safety officers      who suffer a fatal injury in the line of duty and to public      safety officers who suffer a permanently disabling injury in      the line of duty.       PSOBIA would make several important changes to how PSOB is      administered, including making employees and volunteer      members of private, non-profit EMS/rescue     agencies eligible. Volunteer and career firefighters and EMTs      in private, non-profit fire departments already qualify for      PSOB while their counterparts in non-fire-based, private non-     profit EMS systems generally do not. PSOBIA fixes this      inequity.       The bill also clarifies that public safety officers who      suffer a fatal vascular rupture injury in the line of duty      are eligible for PSOB. The Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefits      Act was enacted in 2003 and created a presumption that public      safety officers who suffer a fatal heart attack or stroke      within 24 hours of engaging in emergency response activity      are considered to have died as a result of a line of duty      injury and thus qualify for PSOB. Vascular rupture is a type      of injury that is similar to but technically distinct from      heart attack and stroke.       To reiterate, our organizations support S.A. 2955, which      makes several minor but extremely important changes to how      the PSOB program operates without any additional cost to the      federal government.           Sincerely,     Congressional Fire Services Institute,     International Association of Fire Chiefs,     International Association of Fire Fighters     National Fire Protection Association     National Volunteer Fire Council.                                  ____                    American Ambulance Association,                                                November 27, 2012.     Hon. Carl Levin,     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.     Hon.  John McCain,     Ranking Member, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain: We are      writing to ask your support for a critical amendment to the      FY 13 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Senate      Amendment 2955, the Dale Long Public Safety Officers'      Benefits Improvements Act of 2012.       The American Ambulance Association (AAA) is the primary      trade association for ground ambulance service agencies whose      combined membership provides emergency and non-emergency      medical services to over 75% of the U.S. population. Each day      our first responders put their lives on the line to serve our      nation, yet they face an inequity in the existing Public      Safety Officer Benefits Program, a longstanding Federal      program designed to help honor those that lose their lives in      the line of duty.       In order to fix this inequity, we strongly urge you to      support Senate Amendment 2955. The amendment includes      critical improvements to the Public Safety Officers' Benefits      Program, also known as the Dale Long Public Safety Officers'      Benefits Improvements Act of 2012. This amendment would make      members of rescue squads or ambulance crews operated by      nonprofit entities eligible for benefits paid when a public      safety officers is permanently disabled or dies in the line      of duty. The amendment also includes a host of important      reforms to the program including the reduction of claims      processing and administrative to name a few. Just as      importantly, the Congressional Budget Office has provided a      neutral score on the issue       Every state in the country has communities that have      elected to have their emergency medical services provided by      nongovernmental EMS agencies. The Public Safety Officer      Benefit (PSOB) program, however, currently applies only to      those public safety officers employed by a federal, state, or      local government entity. The brave men and women employed by      nongovernmental EMS agencies provide the same vital emergency      medical services as governmental officers and do so daily in      the same dangerous environments. It is unfair to penalize      nongovernmental public safety officers and their families      simply because their employer is a non-profit EMS agency      which cannot afford to offer the same level of benefits as      the PSOB program. This amendment would correct this inequity.       We thank you for all your years of service to our country      and to the support you've provided to the nation's first      responders. Again, we urge you to support Senate Amendment      2955 as you move forward on the NDAA bill. If you have any      questions, please do not hesitate to contact Tristan North of      the AAA at [emailÂ protected] or 202-486-4888.       Thank you.           Sincerely,                                             Steve Williamson,                                                        President,                                   American Ambulance Association.
