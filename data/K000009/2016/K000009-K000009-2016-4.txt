Speaker, I rise in solidarity and in championing the cause of the steelworkers of our Nation and of the industrial heartland of Lorain, Ohio, and Gary, Indiana, and Youngstown.  Apparently, the Republican majority was not paying attention to the recent election because, in fact, Mr. Trump promised that the Buy American provision and American steel production would be supportive and primary; yet they are proposing to kill the Buy American provision in this bill.  I urge the majority not to forget the promises its party made to these proud and strong American workers. I can assure the majority they won't forget. We also have to stand up to Chinese dumping that has put out of work thousands and thousands and thousands of workers across this country. Given the woes of the American steel industry, encouraging more offshoring is unconscionable.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
