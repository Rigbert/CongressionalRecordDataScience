I want to thank my friend and colleague for yielding.  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution. I would like to thank Chairman Rangel, Chairman Levin and the minority Members for all of their hard work on this effort. This is not a perfect bill, but it is a good bill. I have always believed that our trade policy must be a reflection of our values.  This legislation moves us a step forward in building a bipartisan trade policy. In this bill, we seek to protect the rights of workers to organize. We look out for the environment. When it comes to trade, we all live in the same House, call it the House of Peru, call it the House of America. What we do today with this resolution is in the best interests of all of us who live on this little planet, this little piece of real estate that we call Earth.  I urge all of my colleagues to vote for the passage of this bill.
