Speaker, the bill under consideration has $21 million less for a major House priority than what was included in the fiscal year 2019 Interior and Environment bill passed in the last Congress. I am talking about doing more to prevent and stop catastrophic wildfires.  For the past 4 fiscal years, the House has prioritized funding to improve our national forests and other Federal forestland through the Department of the Interior's and the Forest Service's hazardous fuels reduction programs. These programs use methods such as thinning, prescribed burns, and removing underbrush to help unhealthy forests return to a healthy condition.  In fiscal year 2018, Congress provided $614 million for these programs. Last year, the House-passed bill increased that amount by $30 million for fiscal year 2019. The bill before us today, H.R. 266, only provides a $9 million increase. My motion to recommit will fix this major problem and save lives.  The increase is offset by a reduction in the Bureau of Land Management's deferred maintenance account and the Forest Service's capital improvement and maintenance account. These infrastructure programs received significant increases in fiscal year 2018, and they have a large carryover balance.  Mr. Speaker, my bottom line is that I cannot support a bill that does less to prevent catastrophic wildfires. My home State of California experienced deadly and record-setting wildfires last year. I was with the President; former Governor Brown and current Governor Newsom; our minority leader; and our colleague, Congressman LaMalfa, in Paradise late last year. In 2017, I also visited Santa Rosa with my colleague from the northern part of the State, Congressman  Mike Thompson. The devastation I saw was indescribable and heartbreaking.  While we can and should continue to debate what more needs to be done to improve the health of our Nation's forests, I am proud that the Interior and Environment Subcommittee, on a bipartisan and bicameral basis, has led the way.  The subcommittee successfully negotiated a forest management reform package and fire-borrowing fix as part of the fiscal year 2018 omnibus appropriations bill. It allowed for more on-the-ground forest management activities. These are the activities that prevent the natural cycle of fires from exploding into terrible conditions.                              {time}  1045  It provided smarter budgeting for wildfire suppression costs. The budgeting reforms go into effect in fiscal year 2020.  I am certain that the new chair on the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, my distinguished colleague and friend from Minnesota, looks forward to that. It has been a pleasure to work with her as partners on the forest management and wildland fire budgeting issues.  Yet, there is more that we need to do. Today we can start by supporting this motion. It will send a strong message to the Senate that they should focus on this issue. More importantly, it will show Californians and other Americans affected by wildfire that the House is doing something about this problem.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the motion, and I yield back the balance of my time.  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this motion to recommit.
