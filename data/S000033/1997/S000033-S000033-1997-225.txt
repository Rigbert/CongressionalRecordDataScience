 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by high school students from Essex High School in Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       Mr. Nesto: Good morning, Congressman Sanders. Social      Security first began August 14, 1935 when President Franklin      Delano Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act. Social      Security was started because people began facing the      uncertainty of debt in old age. After Social Security numbers      were signed the first taxes were collected beginning in      January 1937, and until 1940 Social Security paid benefits in      the form of single lump sum payments.       In January of 1940, Ida Mae Fuller became the first person      to receive new monthly Social Security benefits. She received      $22.54 payment per month for the rest of her life.       In 1950, there was new legislation to increase the checks      to offset the increase in the price of living and inflation.       In the 1960s the age requirement for Social Security was      lowered to 62. Also Medicare was added so that people age 65      years and older could receive health care.       In the 70s it became clear that Social Security was having      a problem. Programs were run by the state and local      government. The programs became more complex and inconsistent      with each other. They decided to convert over three million      people from state control to federal control to solve the      problem, but in the '80s more problems formed. Social      Security ran into long-term financial problems which led to      many cut-backs.       Today many believe that Social Security--some people      believe that Social Security is in trouble. People who have      reached the age for benefits expect to be paid what they have      put into the system all their lives. During the month of      December, 1996, $28,147,981 was paid out nationally. In      Vermont there was $6,280,000 paid out. There is currently      43,557,700 people who receive money nationally. This right      here shows the breakdown of different people that receive      payments. It is broken down into widowers and retired people,      too. 98,316 people receive that in Vermont.       Mr. Hershey: According to the Social Security      Administration there is currently more money going in than      there is being paid out. This is to create a surplus for baby      boomers.       The problem we foresee is the amount of money we receive.      7.65 percent of your paycheck goes to Social Security, and      your employer pays out 7.65 percent. Out of that 15.3      percent, 10.5 percent goes to retirement, survivor's,      dependents and trust fund insurance. the total reserve for      that category for one year is $416 billion. 1.7 percent goes      to disability insurance which has a reserve of $6 billion.      2.9 percent goes to Medicare and we reserve $127 million and      currently we have a .02 percent that is unaccounted for.       For retired workers per month average payout is $745.      Disabled workers will have about $704 and nondisabled widows      and widowers will have $707. Even the maximum of $725 a month      is not enough for a person to live. This is our biggest      concern. Many retired people have many problems because      Social Security doesn't pay enough, plus added to the problem      is the government needs more money; Social Security is an      easy target.       Our solutions are short and simple. The easiest thing is      for Social Security to be set aside like a piggy bank making      it a law for the Government not to take out of it. The other      is that a person who works for about 50 years should have      built up enough money to pay for themselves for at least a      half of that time. We recommend that the taxes be put in a      fund that gains interest over the time they work. A certain      amount will go to a fund for disabled people who have had to      stop work earlier. If the first taxes are left alone and      allowed to make interest over 50 years we should be able to      have every two or three working months to pay for one month      of retirement.       There is a chart here, it sort of maps out the government      mandates savings which go to a direct fund and basically it      will be there for you when you retire. We hope you will take      our ideas into consideration and practice.       Mr. Nesto: Right now the Social Security Administration is      taking in more money than they are giving out right now and      so they do not have any problems right now. But speculation      in the upcoming years, people believe, and I do not      necessarily believe that there is going to be a problem but      it is speculation because as the baby boomers age, pretty      soon as those people are going to be retiring and that's why      we are taking in more money now so we can give them back      their funds. So when that money is used for the baby boomers      is there going to be enough money to pay for our retirement?       Right now there is not really any education on this. A lot      of people believe that the Social Security Administration is      going bankrupt and stuff like that, but they do not really--     if they research the subject they wouldn't really--they'd      find out it is not really a problem right now.       Mr. Hersey. I have seen a lot of like news shows where      people are living on Social Security where there is a company      that is creating insurance funds so people pay for it and      perhaps those companies are creating that impression so they      can make more money in their fund.                               ____________________
