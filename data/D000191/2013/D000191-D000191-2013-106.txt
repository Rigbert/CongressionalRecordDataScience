  Mr. DeFAZIO. The Republicans, under the guise of being family friendly, are going to strip American workers of overtime pay. That's right, work more than 40 hours a week, you don't get paid overtime anymore under their bill. Instead, you get comp time.  They say, Oh, this is family friendly, it's flexible. Well, there's certainly flexibility now that employers can grant people leave for family problems and other things. This would be essentially an interest-free loan to employers. They tell you you're working 50 hours, and I'll give you comp time, but it's up to them to give you the comp time. So they could wait until the end of the year, then pay you the overtime without having granted you comp time and having had an interest-free loan. This is outrageous.  Many Americans are having trouble making ends meet. They're dependent upon overtime pay to make ends meet. Wages are stagnant, and they need the overtime pay to make ends meet. Women still only earn 77 cents on the dollar compared to male workers. They need the overtime pay to help feed their kids. But, no, the Republicans want to take that away from them under the guise of being female friendly.  Happy Mother's Day from the Republicans.                          ____________________
