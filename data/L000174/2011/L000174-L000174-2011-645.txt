He was a man of real courage, extraordinary idealism, committed to serving this country, and a dear friend.  As a veteran of World War II, the founding director of the Peace Corps, and the driving force behind Lyndon Johnson's war on poverty, Sarge believed in the good things government can do for people. Among his many accomplishments, he gave us the Head Start program, the Job Corps and Legal Services for the Poor, and the Volunteers in Service to America. Later in life he became the U.S. Ambassador to France, and then president of the Special Olympics, an organization founded by his remarkable wife Eunice Kennedy Shriver.  Sargent Shriver's impact on American life was profound. Through the many programs he championed, Sarge had a direct and lasting effect on the lives of millions of Americans. He was wholly committed to helping people and to the ideals he believed our country ought to stand for, and he was tireless and unrelenting in his pursuit of those goals.  The Peace Corps, one of Sarge's most important and long-lasting accomplishments, enables young Americans to serve their country by building understanding between cultures and working to improve the lives of others in developing countries. Shriver's spirit lives on through the Peace Corps, and it is incumbent on all of us to ensure that the agency fulfills his vision, and the vision of President Kennedy.  My friend Bono, a committed advocate in the fight against global poverty, was himself inspired by President Kennedy's call to action and by Sargent Shriver's work to put it into effect. He recently wrote an op-ed which appeared in the New York Times entitled, ``What I Learned From Sargent Shriver.'' In honor of Sarge, I ask unanimous consent that a copy be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record.                [From the New York Times, Jan. 19, 2011]                  What I Learned From Sargent Shriver                               (By Bono)       The Irish are still mesmerized by the mythical place that      is America, but in the '60s our fascination got out of hand.      I was not old enough to remember the sacrifices of the great      generation who saved Europe in the Second World War, or to      quite comprehend what was going on in Vietnam. But what I do      remember, and cannot forget, is watching a man walk on the      moon in 1969 and thinking here is a nation that finds joy in      the impossible.       The Irish saw the Kennedys as our own royal family out on      loan to America. A million of them turned out on J.F.K.'s      homecoming to see these patrician public servants who,      despite their station, had no patience for the status quo.      (They also loved that the Kennedys looked more WASP than any      ``Prod,'' our familiar term for Protestant.)       I remember Bobby's rolled-up sleeves, Jack's jutted jaw and      the message--a call to action--that the world didn't have to      be the way it was. Science and faith had found a perfect      rhyme.       In the background, but hardly in the shadows, was Robert      Sargent Shriver. A diamond intelligence, too bright to keep      in the darkness. He was not Robert or Bob, he was Sarge, and      for all the love in him, he knew that love was a tough word.      Easy to say, tough to see it through. Love, yes, and peace,      too, in no small measure; this was the '60s but you wouldn't      know it just by looking at him. No long hair in the Shriver      house, or rock 'n' roll. He and his beautiful bride, Eunice      Kennedy Shriver, would go to Mass every day--as much an act      of rebellion against brutal modernity as it was an act of      worship. Love, yes, but love as a brave act, a bold act,      requiring toughness and sacrifice.       His faith demanded action, from him, from all of us. For      the Word to become flesh, we had to become the eyes, the      ears, the hands of a just God. Injustice could, in the words      of the old spiritual, ``Be Overcome.'' Robert Sargent sang,      ``Make me a channel of your peace,'' and became the song.     Make me a channel of your peace:     Where there is hatred let me bring your love.     Where there is injury, your pardon, Lord,     And where there's doubt, true faith in you.     Oh, Master grant that I may never seek,     So much to be consoled as to console.     To be understood as to understand,     To be loved as to love with all my soul.     Make me a channel of your peace,     Where there's despair in life, let me bring hope.     Where there is darkness, only light,     And where there's sadness, ever joy.       The Peace Corps was Jack Kennedy's creation but embodied      Sargent Shriver's spirit. Lyndon Johnson declared war on      poverty but Sarge led the charge. These, and the Special      Olympics, were as dramatic an incarnation of the ideas at the      heart of America as the space program.       Robert Sargent Shriver changed the world more than a few      times and, I am happy to say, changed my world forever. In      the late '90s, when the Jubilee 2000 campaign--which aimed to      cancel the debts that the poorest nations owed to the      richest--asked me to help in the United States, I called on      the Shriver clan for help and advice. What I got were those      things in spades, and a call to arms like a thump in the      back.       In the years since, Bobby Shriver--Sarge's oldest son and--     I co-founded three fighting units in the war against global      poverty: DATA, ONE and (RED). We may not yet know what it      will take to finish the fight and silence suffering in our      time, but we are flat out trying to live up to Sarge's drill.       I have beautiful memories of Bobby and me sitting with his      father and mother at the Shrivers' kitchen table--the same      team that gazed over J.F.K.'s shoulder--looking over our      paltry attempts at speechifying, prodding and pushing us      toward comprehensibility and credibility, a challenge when      your son starts hanging round with a bleeding-heart Irish      rock star.       Toward the end, when I visited Sarge as a frailer man, I      was astonished by his good spirits and good humor. He had the      room around him laughing out loud. I thought it a fitting      final victory in a life that embodied service and      transcended, so often, grave duty, that he had a certain      weightlessness about him. Even then, his job nearly done, his      light shone undiminished, and brightened us all.                          ____________________
