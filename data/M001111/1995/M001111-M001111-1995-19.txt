 President, I rise today to support the National Highway System Designation Act. I add my support to this conference report though, with serious concerns. Concerns over the safety provisions I originally voted for in the Senate legislation have now been replaced by changes to the bill that could threaten the safety of our Nation's highways.  Of foremost concern is the Senate provision to require a national maximum speed limit for trucks and buses. This important mandate was dropped from the conference report and will not only increase speeds for the oversized vehicles, but also increase their stopping distances.  I am also concerned over a House provision that could exempt trucks weighing 10,000 to 26,000 pounds gross vehicle weight rating from Federal safety rules including driver hours-of-service restrictions, driver medical qualifications, safety equipment and maintenance requirements, and roadside driver and equipment safety inspections.  Mr. President, I am hopeful that our State legislatures will step up and seek solutions to these shortcomings in an otherwise well intentioned piece of legislation. I was hesitant to support a conference report that retreats on issues of safety such as these, however the passage of this national highway system designation is essential to our Nation's very livelihood. A delay of implementation of this act will begin to cost my State of Washington approximately $120 million over 2 years.  The time to move this bill is long overdue. We can not lose this valuable opportunity to support 4 percent for the Nation's four million miles of public roads. This National Highway System will carry 40 percent of the Nation's highway traffic and 70 percent of the truck freight traffic. One behalf of my State's Governor and secretary of transportation, I urge my colleagues to pass this conference report and continue our Nation's strong commitment to interstate commerce and mobility.
