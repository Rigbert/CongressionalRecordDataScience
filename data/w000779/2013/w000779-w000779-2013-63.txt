So we have two thoughtful Senators coming together and they have worked with a whole host of commercial building interests and they are going to make it possible, in my view, to save a lot of energy that will result in savings for homeowners and other Americans.  I would be interested in the Senator's take on the various amendments that have been filed because I think those amendments take the very fine bill she and Senator Portman have and make it even better.
