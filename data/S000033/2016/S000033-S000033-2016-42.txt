 President, I ask to have printed in the Record copies of some of the finalist essays written by Vermont High School students as part of the sixth annual ``What is the State of the Union'' essay contest conducted by my office. These finalists were selected from nearly 800 entries.  The material follows:              SARA MANFREDI, MILTON HIGH SCHOOL (FINALIST)       Before I begin this address, I would like to take a moment      to thank all of you for being here today. But, there are      issues our country must conquer in order to make our home      safer, as well as more equal, for both ourselves, and the      generations to come.       In recent years, it has come to attention of our government      that there have been over 400,000 untested rape kits stuck in      backlog all around the country. One precinct held over 5,000      in backlog, all untested, most cases left without any trial.      How dare we do this to those hundreds upon thousands of      victims? Who are we to deny them any sense of safety or      justice? These facts have done nothing more than allow      rapists to get out of any sort of punishment. This horrid      trend must be stopped, and can only be stopped if this      government takes immediate action. The issue with this is      that many of these local jurisdictions do not have the money      to process these kits, because of the innate lack of funding      for said kits to be processed. I am willing to offer more      funding through federal grants to these precincts, so these      long backlogs can finally be tested, and the victims of these      crimes can get the justice they deserve. To ensure this money      is used to test these rape kits, I will work with Congress to      pass a law into action that will give precincts a time      constraint in which they must have these kits tested, most      likely within 72 hours. By having this deadline set into      place, as well as the money to fund said testing, this      national backlog will gradually dwindle down. This justice is      owed to the survivors of these vicious assaults.       Some victims, however, cannot be given the justice they      deserve. A recent influx of mass shootings have killed 380      American citizens, and left hundreds of families in mourning      over their lost loved ones. I am not going to say that any      one of the perpetrators of the 294 mass shootings in the past      year killed because they were lonely, lost outsiders. These      killers were not in the right mind, no, but mental health is      not to blame. What is to blame is American gun laws. These      men were able to commit these heinous crimes because of how      accessible guns are in this country. How do we stop this? We      restrict and complicate. If we are to ensure the safety of      the American public, we must ensure that only those who are      specifically trained to use a gun, those who are able to      handle one and not go awry are allowed to carry one. Police      officers and military personnel should be the only ones to be      able to carry handguns at all times for their jobs. Rifles      shall be heavily restricted as well, only distributed to      those who undergo a complicated vetting process, as to ensure      that they will not become the next person to kill innocent      bystanders. I just want the American public to be safe. I do      not want any more men, women, and children to be victims of      these preventable crimes. I only wish the best for us. Thank      you.       WILLIAM MARTIN, MOUNT ABRAHAM UNION HIGH SCHOOL (FINALIST)       The United States is being cornered by problems, of all      shapes and magnitude, from every direction. These issues need      more attention and they will not be solved unless action is      taken against them. Many of these situations will only get      worse the longer we put them off. There are a variety of      problems ranging from climate change to healthcare and we      should be looking for a solution for all of them. The three      issues that the U.S. should put most of its focus on,      however, is the threat from ISIS, the price of higher      education, and the cases of racism, especially those in      police shootings.       The United States should spend more money to prevent ISIS      from growing and causing more damage, because ISIS is a      danger to the U.S., as well as other countries around the      world and their citizens. Terrorism could also continue for a      lot longer if we do not stop it soon. Terrorism really came      onto the world stage after September 11, 2001. In a single      day, a small group of people managed to kill thousands. Even      before this, al-Qaeda truly started in the 1990s. This shows      how long these groups have managed to continue, despite our      efforts, which means we need to do more. Not only do we need      to get rid of the organizations like ISIS that are here now,      but we have to provide a stable system to make sure these      types of groups don't return, or we could risk another      disaster. ISIS will actually pay foreign fighters $1,000 a      month, which is how they get many of their recruits.      Unfortunately, ISIS has a wide spread with connections in      many places. This is a reason why it is hard to eradicate      them, but also shows that we need to invest more into it if      we want to get it done. The U.S. is however, already spending      $40 billion on fighting ISIS annually. This is a large sum of      money, but of the $1.1 trillion that the U.S. had for      discretionary spending in 2015, it is only about 3.6 percent.      The U.S. has a responsibility to help with the fight against      ISIS, and the government should spend more money to disrupt      this organization because they are a threat to everyone,      everywhere, and will not go away unless we make them.       The U.S. should also spend more money on education, to make      college more accessible to the average student, because it is      important for getting good jobs and it costs far too much      now. The average cost to go to a private college is $32,405      which deters a lot of students who can't afford that price      for four years. Since this price is so high, and those who      can't afford it simply can't go, it leaves many without the      education needed for higher paying jobs. This number is far      too high. This even gives some doubt about getting their      degrees, simply from the fear of debt. It is necessary to get      a high paying job to be able to happily provide for a family,      however the cost to get there is damaging, which is why the      government has to step in. If the government did decide to      make public college tuition free, it would cost $62.6      billion. This cost may be high, but it's not even what is      needed. There simply needs to be more spent on making it more      affordable. Also, theoretically, if the government needed to      raise taxes to make tuition affordable, and nearly everyone      had gone to college and had a high paying job, then after a      couple years they could raise taxes without too much effect.      The U.S. needs to make college easier for everyone and make      it more affordable, because it costs far too much and could      help citizens live an easier life with more money.       The U.S. government needs to take more action against      racial events because they defy the constitutional values of      the United States and these problems only get worse when left      unsolved. The U.S. abolished slavery in 1865 under President      Lincoln, but since then there has always been a separation of      people of color because of the false thought of white      superiority. We can see this in the way black people were      treated in the 20th century, in how they were allowed little      compared to those who were white. This shows a deep root of      racism in this country, and though we have been making      efforts to reduce it more and more, it still seems to not be      enough. A large racism topic that has been in the media for a      while is the shooting and other abuse white cops have      committed on people of color. One example is Michael Brown, a      black 18 year old, who was fatally shot in 2014 by a white      officer. After there was no conviction of Darren Wilson, the      shooter, many cried out in outrage. The commotion that was      caused from that killing, and others, caused massive amounts      of damage in protests to both people and property. There      needs to be a better way to deal with these situations,      otherwise the outrage will continue. There is also a question      raised by statistics like that only 13.2% of the U.S.      population is black, and yet they make up 39.4% of the prison      population, or that nearly 50% of hate crimes are about      racism. These numbers show how we need to increase the      involvement of the government in these events--we cannot just      ignore the danger behind these statistics. On the other hand,      all U.S. citizens have the same legal rights, no matter their      gender, race, or religion. This fact however, may not be      fully true, because though on paper it may say there is no      discrimination, that does not mean that there aren't people      who do discriminate based on race. The government needs to      step in on this issue, and use their power to end it, because      it is dangerous to all and defies our American morals.       The U.S. will find itself in trouble if solutions are not      quickly found to ISIS, the price of higher education, and      acts of racism. If action is not taken against ISIS to      permanently disrupt them, the danger they cause for everyone      will only increase and get worse. Similarly, if money is not      put towards helping offset the cost of higher education, we      could see more and more people who can't afford to get a      degree that could get them a job they can live off of, which      would increase the separation of the upper and middle class.      Lastly, it is very important that the U.S. finds a solution      to the acts of racism that cause only harm and anarchy. The      U.S. will never become the true country it was meant to be,      and the ``American Dream'' will be fiction for many, until      the problems we face today are solved.       HADLEY MENK, CHAMPLAIN VALLEY UNION HIGH SCHOOL (FINALIST)       All men are created equal. America was founded upon this      fundamental belief, but today the meaning of these words has      been lost.       Americans are not equal when some cannot afford healthcare,      when a woman's power over her body is diminished, or when the      pursuit of happiness is lost in the struggle to     feed a family. Economically, there is more inequality in      America than ever. According to the Pew Research Center,      since 1983 ``virtually all wealth gains made by U.S. families      have gone to the upper-income group.'' The top 1% of American      families received 22.5% of all pre-tax income in 2012, with      the bottom 90% receiving less than 50% of total income for      the first time ever.       For the plights of everyday Americans to rightfully regain      the attention of the government, the deluge of money being      pumped into the electoral system by big corporations and      wealthy donors must be stopped. New campaign finance      regulations and a reversal of the Citizens United decision      will take the government out of the control of the wealthy      elite and put it back into the hands of the people.       Policies designed to combat income inequality at its roots      are the only way to fix our broken system. For example, we      need a minimum wage that allows families an equal chance at      happiness. We need political leadership that will give low-     income women an equal chance at personal liberty, instead of      seeking to strip funding from organizations like Planned      Parenthood, which for many women are their only option for      reproductive healthcare. We need a healthcare system that      ensures that no one has less of a right to health because of      their socioeconomic class. We need affordable education and      job training programs to give young people the tools they      need to contribute to our economy. Tax cuts for the      wealthiest have only widened the gap and made life harder for      too many Americans. It's time to unite, rather than divide,      our country.       In order for the American people to unite, elected      officials must lead the way, by following the will of the      people, instead of the dictates of their wealthy donors. For      example, in their 2014 National Climate Assessment, the White      House found that low-income and minority communities suffer      the most from climate change-induced events, including heat      waves and floods. Still, many in Congress who benefit from      oil companies continue to deny climate change exists.      Congress must begin a full-scale attack on climate change      including carbon emission taxes, incentives for renewable      energy companies and consumers, and efforts to protect      valuable natural resources.       ``Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness . . . to      secure these rights, Governments are instituted among men.''      It's time for our government to reaffirm its commitment to      the founding document which formed it 250 years ago, one      which outlined a government whose purpose was to uphold its      people's fundamental rights. When these rights are infringed      upon by inequality, it is the duty of the government to      address that inequality in order to preserve our American      identity.         SOPHIA PARKER, VERGENNES UNION HIGH SCHOOL (FINALIST)       Nelson Mandela proclaimed: ``It is in your hands to make of      our world a better one for all.''       It is easy to feel overwhelmed by the complex and      devastating crises we face today as a nation, to believe the      solutions are out of our hands. I see two parallel sets of      problems. On one hand, we have institutionalized problems      which will require institutional solutions, financial      resources, and political will. On the other hand, there is a      personal malaise, discouragement, and alienation among      citizens. The two problems are related because the alienation      and discouragement stem in part from systems that have become      corrupt and ineffective, serving the needs of the few at the      expense of the many. However, there is also power in our      simple personal choices and actions, which is often      overlooked. Engaging this power does not require a political      solution. A child can bring this forth. The most      disenfranchised person can make a difference. This power      resides in the simple personal choice to do good, to take      action, to care, to make one small or large movement towards      making life a little better for somebody.       Every one of us has strengths that we can bring to bear for      the sake of another individual, our community, a specific      cause, or the world at large. If each person devoted even an      hour a week to making the world a better place, it would have      a tremendous impact.       You are never too young or old to make a difference. You      are never too poor, too weak, or too busy to make a      difference. Every single one of us has strengths that we can      harness to make the world better for the people around us. My      10 year-old neighbor drives his family's tractor to plow our      driveway after every snowstorm, out of the kindness of his      heart. My mom and I run wildlife camps for kids; one of our 9      year-old campers started an organization to help older      shelter cats find homes. A sophomore at my high school helped      organize a winter sleep-out to end homelessness, attended by      over a hundred people. These are all young people seeing      problems and finding ways to take action through compassion,      courage, creativity, and community service.       I serve as Miss Vermont's Outstanding Teen; my platform is      wildlife rehabilitation and stewardship of the natural world,      which is a cause to which I have been devoted since I was a      small child. I travel across Vermont encouraging young people      to find their own passion and get involved in contributing      something of value to their communities. The response is      always inspiring.       The problems around us are daunting indeed. However, we      cannot underestimate the power for good that resides in each      individual. It can begin with something as simple as lending      each other a hand, and can build into making our world a      better one for all.                               ____________________
