 Chairman, I would just like to take this opportunity to thank all of those people who have supported this amendment, and show my respect for those people who have been in opposition. It has been a good debate. It has been an important debate. We need more debates like this.  It seems to me, Mr. Chairman, there are three basic points that I would like to make. Number one, I hope everybody understands that this amendment does not stop the Treasury Department from stabilizing U.S. currency. That remains, absolutely, as has been the case for so many years.  Number two, I think there is an important constitutional issue. That is, should we sit back and allow tens and tens of billions of dollars from U.S. taxpayers being placed at risk without debate, without discussion?  The third point that I would make is that if we pass this amendment, it allows the Congress to become more involved in debates over the global economy that my friend, the gentleman from California (Mr. Dooley) has touched on.  I would simply suggest that if we look at the global economy, the standard of living of American workers has declined over the last 20 years. People are working longer hours for lower wages. We have lost millions of decent jobs.
