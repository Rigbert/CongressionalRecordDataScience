 Although FISA requires oversight reporting to the Intelligence Committees, the law makes clear that other Committees may also have oversight jurisdiction. Section 108 of FISA, 50 U.S.C. 1808, states, ``Nothing in this title shall be deemed to limit the authority and responsibility of the appropriate committees of each House of Congress to obtain such information as they may need to carry out their respective functions and duties.'' Section 306 of FISA, 50 U.S.C. 1826, provides for semiannual reports from the Attorney General to the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees on the number of applications for physical search orders made, granted, modified, or denied, and the number of physical searches which involved the property of United States persons.
