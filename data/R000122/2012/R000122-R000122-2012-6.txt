President, I want to join Senator Whitehouse in commending the Presiding Officer for his underlying legislation, along with Senator Isakson, and commend my colleague and friend, Senator Whitehouse, for his leadership on this issue, and begin where he left off, which is, in the wake of the unfathomable tragedy in Newtown, CT, the idea that we do not need more trained child psychiatrists and child counselors is difficult to understand. We do need them.  The legislation the Senator from Pennsylvania has introduced would help children's hospitals across the Nation and we are strongly behind it. But we also want to make help available to children's psychiatric hospitals, such as Bradley Hospital in Rhode Island.  One of the facts that emerged from the terrible tragedy in Newtown is that we have young people who need help, desperately need help, and their parents need help--help to recognize problems, help to not only diagnose them but treat them, and we do not have a sufficient number of trained child psychiatrists in the country to do that.  This legislation, this amendment, would allow us to do that. It adds no cost, as Senator Whitehouse indicated, and I think it should be something that we would do almost automatically when it comes to the welfare of our children, but particularly in the wake of the terrible tragedy in Connecticut.  So I wanted to be here to lend my support to the underlying efforts of the Senator from Pennsylvania and to the specific efforts of my colleague, the Senator from Rhode Island.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a statement by Dr. Gregory Fritz, who is the academic director of the residency program at Bradley Hospital, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     Parity for Kids' Mental Health       Despite the passage of the federal mental-health parity      bill, stigma and prejudice are still alive and well when it      comes to legislation affecting children's psychiatric      hospitals. The latest example of how our government continues      to maintain discriminatory funding policies specifically      directed against children with mental-health issues involves      federal support for graduate medical education (GME).       Although this issue is far overshadowed by the federal debt      issue, those who care about the mental health of children      need to be aware that achieving true parity still entails      overcoming significant obstacles. Getting children's      psychiatric hospitals recognized as legitimate sites of      medical education is one such obstacle on the road to real      parity that has both symbolic and pragmatic importance.       The history of federal support for training physicians      during their hospital residencies goes back to the      establishment of Medicare, in 1965. Recognizing that America      needs a steady supply of physicians in all the areas of      medicine, and that their training carries substantial      additional expense for teaching hospitals, Medicare      authorization includes a per-resident reimbursement that is      provided to hospitals through a complicated formula. One      element for determining GME payments is the percentage of a      hospital's reimbursement that comes from Medicare. That      children's hospitals would thus be excluded from the program      (because Medicare pays virtually zero for children's medical      care) was unintentional, but it took 34 years for this      oversight to be corrected.       The Children's Hospitals Graduate Medical Education Payment      Program (CHGME), in 1999, established a pool to provide      residency education support to children's hospitals in a      system modeled after the Medicare GME system. The      unintentional disincentive to train pediatric generalists and      specialists was removed and pediatric training accelerated      dramatically. This year, a total of $317.5 million offsets      the training expenses of 5,500 residents at 46 children's      hospitals, and the CHGME program is widely considered a      success.       Parallel to the initial oversight in the Medicare bill, in      the arcane definition of a children's hospital detailed in      the CHGME regulations is language making it impossible for      children's psychiatric hospitals to qualify. Only the most      cynical observer would conclude that this was a deliberate      attempt to exclude children's psychiatric hospitals and the      child psychiatric and pediatric residents they train,      especially since no medical specialty represents a greater      shortage area than child and adolescent psychiatry. Yet,      steady efforts since 2002 to correct this oversight have thus      far been unsuccessful.       The CHGME reauthorization needed for the program to      continue would seem to offer the ideal opportunity to end      this de facto discrimination against children with mental-     health problems. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse and Representatives      David Cicilline and James Langevin, all Rhode Island      Democrats, have offered similar versions of a brief amendment      to the reauthorization that would correct the language to      reflect the original bill's intent.       If passed, it would admit four or five children's      psychiatric hospitals that meet strict criteria into the pool      of hospitals eligible for CHGME reimbursement. A larger      taxpayer outlay is not requested; rather, the existing money      would be spread slightly more thinly (an estimated 30      additional residents would be added to the current 5,500).      One would think it a small price to pay to correct an      injustice, but passage is far from guaranteed.       As a child psychiatrist working at Bradley Hospital, one of      the psychiatric hospitals that would finally be included, I'm      far from dispassionate about this issue. I see every     day the agony experienced by families with autism, childhood      suicide, adolescent substance abuse or pediatric bipolar      disorder; it's different, but no less severe, than the pain      associated with juvenile diabetes or leukemia. As are all      mental-health professionals, I'm troubled by the months-long      waiting lists that prevent children's access to child      psychiatric services.       The distinction between psychological and physiological      disorders is artificial and antiquated, reflecting outdated      fears and prejudices. In short, I see no valid reason to      perpetuate the exclusion of children's psychiatric hospitals      from the mechanism designed to support physicians' training.      Neither do the thousands of members of 39 national      organizations who have signed on to a letter urging support      of the Whitehouse amendment. Mental-health parity is the law      in principle; the CHGME reauthorization should make it be the      case in practice.
