Again, I haven't read the legislation. So I see the pledge. I'm not sure what's in the legislation.  I thank the gentleman for his observation that we need a meaningful and, I would say, robust addressing of the problem that confronts us. In fact, as you know, because we have discussed it at the White House for 4 days now, from Sunday night through last night--I guess 5 days--the President of the United States has been indicating that we need--he calls it a ``big''--a grand design, if you will, along the lines that have been suggested by two of the commissions, which on a bipartisan basis recommended a grand design. That grand design would have reached at least $4 trillion in deficit reduction and debt reduction, and, in fact, that is a figure somewhere close to the budget that was passed through this House. I might say to the gentleman parenthetically that it's my understanding that the Cut, Cap, and Balance might get closer to the RSC numbers than your budget number that was passed here. The RSC number that I refer to, of course, was the amendment that was defeated on this floor by one vote.  But I would say to the gentleman that the President wants to do a grand design to reduce that deficit not by $1 trillion or $2 trillion or $3 trillion but by $4 trillion. There was a commission or a group--the ``Biden group'' we call it--in which the gentleman participated. There were other discussions between your Speaker and the President all looking at achieving a large deficit reduction. The gentleman at some point in time decided that was not something that he wanted to continue working on and suggested that it be, I suppose, pushed up the line, and it was. So I said, the President was for a grand design. The leader of the Senate, Mr. Reid, was for that. Mr. Durbin was for it. Ms. Pelosi was for it. I was for it, and the Vice President was for it. But unfortunately, we couldn't proceed on that discussion in a successful way, at least, because the gentleman observed and his colleagues observed that, as long as there were any revenues attached to that, it would not be acceptable to your side of the aisle, notwithstanding that every bipartisan commission that has dealt with this issue has indicated that it needed to be a balanced package, that it needed to include substantial cuts, that it needed to deal with discretionary spending, defense spending, entitlement spending, and that it needed to deal with tax expenditures.  The gentleman says correctly that we want to balance our revenues with our expenditures. The problem is, if you keep cutting revenues, you're just going to be chasing yourself down. Obviously, you want to bring revenue rates down. I hope we can do that. But if we bring them down to a place where we don't have the money to pay for what we buy--which is, of course, what happened in this past decade--then we will be confronted with a situation that the gentleman wants to avoid, and that is: raising the debt limit. What we have done over the last 10 years is buy more than we can afford; therefore, we have a debt. That's why the gentleman, as I say, voted for extending the debt limit. That's why I voted for it.  I will tell the gentleman that I have a Gallup Poll here that says, ``Seventy-four percent of the Republicans agree that a responsible deficit reduction plan should include both tax increases and spending cuts, and 77 percent of independents believe the plan should include a mix of revenue and spending cuts.'' I say that so that I can elicit from the gentleman--I know there is sentiment on your side of the aisle; I know there is sentiment on my side of the aisle. And I told you--and you know the President of the United States believes this as well--that we have an opportunity, a critical time in our history, when we have the makings of a bipartisan agreement, the creation of a bipartisan consensus, that will move us in the direction that you and I know we have to move.                              {time}  1300  What is holding us up, as I understand it, is that your side believes that these 77 percent of independents and 74 percent of Republicans are not correct, that revenues ought not to be part of this package. Clearly, we agree and have agreed that spending cuts need to be a part of it.  So I ask the gentleman, is there any possibility that these 74 percent of Republicans are correct that, in fact, if we are going to have a successful package, it will be because it is balanced? Because my view is, I tell my friend, that, if we do this, it's going to really create jobs.  Now, we haven't done any jobs bills, we believe, in this Congress. We believe the only jobs bill you really did so far was the patent bill. I know you are going to talk about all these bills that you did, but we don't think that, because you put ``jobs'' in the titles, it makes them jobs bills.  But the fact of the matter is that, if we can create confidence in the market, if we can create confidence that we can deal with our fiscal situation in a responsible, bipartisan, collegial way, it will have an extraordinarily positive effect on every household in America, the confidence of America that we can work together in a bipartisan way, and we will stabilize the markets and provide for paying our bills and bringing our deficit and debt down.  So I ask my friend, again, does he believe there is any possibility at this point in time that we can reach a balanced agreement on what is called a ``grand design'' along the lines of the recommendations of the bipartisan commission's recommendations?
