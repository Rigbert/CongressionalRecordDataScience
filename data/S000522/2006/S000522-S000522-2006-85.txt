Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time, but I do want to thank Chairman Burton for sponsoring this very important resolution. We often forget just how important our friend is to the north. Canada is a reliable ally, a good friend in thick and thin; so, again, I want to thank Chairman Burton for sponsoring this resolution.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
