Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. Just briefly, obviously, that was an issue that there was strong feeling on, particularly in the Senate, and frankly it was impossible to prevail on that position from the House perspective.  Mr. Speaker, I would enter into a colloquy with the distinguished chairman. The chairman and I have had long discussions and worked many years on the FEC. We differ in our perspectives in some respects, but we have come, I think, to what is a fair agreement on both sides, given the status of the conference report.  Mr. Speaker, I would ask the gentleman, am I correct that under the language that we have adopted with respect to FEC term limits, that there are two Republican vacancies currently and two Democratic vacancies? As I understand it, there are three pending nominations and one Republican that was withdrawn and one that will be made. Hopefully both the executive and the legislative will cooperate to make sure those nominations are made prior to December 31.  It is our understanding that under those circumstances, they would then be able to be reappointed once after the initial appointment.  Is that correct, Mr. Speaker?
