President, 2 years ago this week, President Obama signed into law the affordable care act. This landmark act will extend health insurance coverage to 30 million uninsured Americans in the next few years. Reform based on good-quality and affordable health insurance, talked about for decades, is finally becoming a reality. Over 15 months, Congress debated and then passed the most sweeping and comprehensive reforms to improve the everyday lives of every American since Congress passed Medicare in 1965. It was an arduous process, but in the end this achievement proved that change is possible and that the voices of so many Americans who over the years have called on their leaders to act have finally been heard.  Americans are already beginning to see some of the benefits of insurance reform. Seniors on Medicare who have high-cost prescriptions are starting to receive help when trapped within a coverage gap known as the ``doughnut hole.'' The affordable care act completely closes the coverage gap by 2020, and the new law makes it easier for seniors to afford prescription drugs in the meantime. In 2010, more than 7000 Vermonters received a $250 rebate to help cover the cost of their prescription drugs when they hit the doughnut hole. Last year, nearly 6800 Vermonters with Medicare received a 50-percent discount on their covered brand-name prescriptions, resulting in an average savings of $714 per person. Since the affordable care act was signed into law, more than 4000 young adults in Vermont have gained health insurance coverage under these reforms, which allow young adults to stay on their parents' plans until their 26th birthdays. The improvements we are seeing in Vermont go on and on: 81,649 Vermonters on Medicare and more than 100,000 Vermonters with private insurance gained access to and received preventative screening coverage with no deductible or copay. These are just a few of the dozens of consumer protections included in the law that are benefiting Vermonters and all Americans every day.  Now that the law is in effect, many of the essential antidiscrimination and consumer protections of the affordable care act are being implemented, allowing consumers to take control of their own health care decisions. Known as the Patients' Bill of Rights, these rules protect consumers against the worst health insurance industry abuses that have prevented millions of people from receiving the health care they need. Going forward, insurance plans can no longer deny children coverage because of a preexisting health condition; insurance plans are barred from dropping beneficiaries from coverage simply because of an illness; dozens of preventive care services must be covered at no cost and with no copay; and Americans will have access to an easier appeals process for private medical claims that are denied.  Yet another major reform now protects hard-working Americans from one of the most egregious insurance industry practices: setting lifetime or annual limits on health insurance coverage. Before this change in the law, wherever I traveled in Vermont, I was often stopped in the grocery store, at church, on the street, or at the gas station by Vermonters who shared their personal, wrenching stories about how they could no longer get medical treatment because they had met their annual or lifetime maximum. Many of these Vermonters were perfectly healthy before being diagnosed with cancer or diseases that can cost well beyond their means for treatment. Instead of being able to focus on getting healthy, patients instead had to worry about whether their next doctor's visit will push them above the insurance company's arbitrary limit.  Beginning in 2014, insurance companies will no longer be allowed to deny coverage to individuals with preexisting health conditions or to charge higher premiums based on health status or gender. We learned in a report issued by the National Women's Law Center this week that until these reforms are implemented, insurance companies are continuing to charge women higher premiums than men. In States where this practice is not prohibited, women can pay substantially more than men solely because of their gender. Those who wish to turn back the clock and repeal the affordable care act threaten to return the American people to a broken health insurance system where women can be charged more than men, children can be denied insurance coverage because they were born with a health condition, and individuals risk losing their health insurance solely for getting sick.  In addition to these improvements to our health insurance system, over time the affordable care act will insure 93 percent of our population and make a substantial investment in our economic vitality in the years ahead. I was proud to work with Senator Grassley and others to include strong antifraud provisions in the law that have already helped prevent and detect fraudulent activities that in the past have cost American taxpayers millions of dollars each year. Despite the specious arguments from opponents of reform, this bill is the largest deficit reduction measure upon which many in Congress will ever cast a vote. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that comprehensive reform will reduce the Federal deficit by $143 billion through 2019, and by more than $1 trillion in the decades to come.  Regrettably, opponents of the affordable care act have sought to continue their political battle by challenging the landmark legislation in the courts, right from the moment President Obama signed it into law. These opponents seek to achieve in the courts what they could not in Congress. They want judges to override legislative decisions properly assigned by the Constitution to Congress, the elected representatives of the American people.  In my view, the partisan legal challenges to the affordable care act depend on legal theories so extreme they would not only undo the progress we have made in the affordable care act for kids, families, and senior citizens, they would turn back the clock even farther to the hardships of the Great Depression. They seek to strike down principles that have been settled for nearly three quarters of a century and have helped us build and secure the social safety net through Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. These challenges to Congress's constitutional authority to enact the affordable care act have been rejected by three courts. Judges appointed by Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents have rejected these challenges, and they were right to do so. Now the case is before the Supreme Court, which will hear arguments next week.  I have joined congressional leaders in filing an amicus brief defending the affordable care act. I did so not only because I have fought for decades to secure affordable health care for all Americans but because I am convinced that Congress acted well within the limits of Article I of the Constitution in doing so. Before passing the affordable care act, Congress expressly considered and rejected arguments that the law, including the requirement that individuals have health insurance, is not constitutional. I believe we must defend the enumerated powers given to Congress by the Constitution so that our ability to help protect hard-working American workers, families, and consumers is not wrongly curtailed by the courts.  What is telling about the partisan nature of these challenges is that many of those who now claim that the requirement that Americans have health insurance or face a tax penalty is unconstitutional are the very ones who proposed it. Republican Senators like Senator Hatch, the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Senator Grassley, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, proposed a health insurance requirement as an alternative when they opposed President Clinton's plan to provide access for all Americans to health care. They were for the individual mandate until President Obama was for it, and now they are against it. Their views may have changed, but the Constitution has not. What they fail to mention are the consequences of removing this provision. If individuals are not required to have health insurance, then they will waituntil they are sick to get coverage, driving up the costs for everyone else in the meantime. This will mean that many of the consumer protections in the law, such as the ban on preexisting health conditions, would disappear, once again leaving millions uninsured. For sake of the health and security of our Nation, the Supreme Court should not cast aside this landmark law and Congress's time-honored ability to act on behalf of the American people.  The affordable care act is a tremendous achievement that will improve the lives of Americans for generations to come. For decades, we have heard heartbreaking stories about the enormous challenges Americans face because they are uninsured or underinsured. With each year that we move forward to implement the features of the affordable care act, these stories are becoming fewer and fewer and are being replaced by stories of the success of these reforms, one family at a time, all across Vermont and all across America.  There is still much more to accomplish, and there are still millions of Americans who are struggling to buy or keep adequate health insurance coverage for their families or themselves. As these reforms are implemented over the next few years, I will continue to work with Vermonters and the Department of Health and Human Services to help Americans have the access to the quality, affordable health insurance that each and every American needs and deserves.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
