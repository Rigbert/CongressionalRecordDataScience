President, I rise today to pay special tribute to an exceptional hometown hero, John Tallman, who is retiring as president of the Bourbonnais, IL, Fire Protection District after 48 years of distinguished service.  On June 7, 1997 colleagues, friends, and family gathered to celebrate John's retirement after a lifelong commitment to the fire department and the community of Bourbonnais. He certainly deserves such recognition.  Although a farmer by profession, at age 28, John began his service with the volunteer-operated fire protection district as an appointed trustee and was then elected president. As testimony to his commitment and integrity, John has remained the only president in the fire protection district's 49-year history.  Over the years, John guided the fire protection district through remarkable periods of growth and modernization. Under John Tallman's tenure, the Bourbonnais Fire Protection District distinguished itself as one of the outstanding all-volunteer fire departments in the State. Improvements to the fire department facilities, equipment, and service instituted under John's direction enabled the department to better respond to the growing number of emergencies and helped save lives and property.  In addition to his duties with the fire protection district, John has also been a dedicated husband and father, an 18-year member of the Bourbonnais Elementary School Board, a farmer, and a 19-year member of the Kankakee County Board of School Trustees.  John is a role model for all Americans and I commend him for his selfless service and effective leadership to the citizens of Bourbonnais and of our State. A fellow firefighter once described John as being one of a kind. John Tallman leaves behind big shoes to fill, and his leadership and vision as fire protection district president will be missed.                          ____________________
