 ALEXANDER. Of course.  Mr. McCONNELL. I was listening carefully to Senator Gregg and the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, and Senator Coburn and I see another of my colleagues here, Senator Domenici. Let me give a real-world example from my State, information just received. Here is what this particular company experienced today.  ``We were informed''--I will leave out the name of the bank. ``We were informed that an''--I will leave out the name of the county--``industrial revenue bond issued last year could not be resold this week in the market because of the freeze of the credit markets.'' Today. ``These tax free bonds totaling $10 million were issued last year on a variable interest rate basis, secured by a full irrevocable letter of credit from one of the nation's largest and most well capitalized banks.''  No credit problem at all, but no lending--freeze credit. This crisis we are all talking about here is not about a bunch of people on Wall Street. It is about a bunch of people on Main Street, and whether we are going to act on a bipartisan basis to restore confidence, restore confidence in our country and to prevent what could be a major catastrophic event.
