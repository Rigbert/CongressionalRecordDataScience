 President, I rise to join my colleagues from Wisconsin and Tennessee in co-sponsoring Senate Resolution 54, which was introduced on February 25. This resolution makes a strong, and much needed statement about U.S. concern and commitment to African peace and stability.  In the past several years, Sierra Leonians have seen their country go through a tumultuous period. On May 24, 1997, the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) and the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) seized control of Sierra Leone. The United States demanded that democratically elected President Tejan Kabbah be reinstated immediately.  Although diplomatic efforts by the United States and the Economic Community of West African States failed, a West African intervention force, (ECOMOG), was authorized by the international community to intervene, and it was successful in removing the unrecognized military rulers from power. On March 10, 1998, President Kabbah returned after 10 months in exile and reassumed control.  Unfortunately violence continues to ravage the country. In January of this year, RUF launched an offensive to take the capital, Freetown. Though ECOMOG drove rebel forces from the city, numerous reports of rape, mutilations, kidnapping of children for forced combat, and killings of innocent civilians by RUF forces continue to surface.  Official estimates report that in the last 2 months alone, the death toll has reached 2,000 to 3,000 people, with many also dying from lack of food and medicine. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates the number of refugees fleeing to Guinea and Liberia at 440,000.  The administration has expressed shock and horror regarding the desperate situation in Sierra Leone and I am pleased that they have indicated they will provide $1.3 million for logistical support for ECOMOG in 1999, and $55 million for humanitarian assistance for the people of Sierra Leone. This Resolution builds on the administration's efforts, and calls for a strong U.S. commitment to end the violence and suffering in Sierra Leone.  First, it condemns the violence committed by the rebel troops and thosethat provide them with financial, political, and other types of assistance.  Second, it supports increased U.S. political and logistical support for ECOMOG, while recognizing the need for ECOMOG to improve its performance and increase its respect for humanitarian law.  Third, it calls for immediate cessation of hostilities and the observance of human rights.  Fourth, it supports a dialogue between members of the conflict in order to bring about a resolution.  Finally, it expresses support for the people of Sierra Leone in their endeavor to create and maintain a stable democratic society.  The situation in Sierra Leone and the influx of refugees to neighboring countries threatens the stability of the entire West African region. This is not a time for the United States and the international community to turn our backs. The people of Sierra Leone have already suffered too much and will suffer even more if we do not act. Rather, this is the time to stand firmly on the side of peace and democracy and the betterment of the lives of all Sierra Leonians.  By passing this legislation, we are making a strong statement in support of the efforts to contain and bring to a peaceful end this conflict. We have seen all too many times, in all too many places around the world the price that is paid if we choose to avert our eyes and allow violence to flourish. We should not make that mistake. We should not hesitate to raise our voice. I encourage all my colleagues to vote in favor of this resolution and in favor of human rights and justice in Sierra Leone.                          ____________________
