 I have already spoken about this amendment. I think this amendment is as sad as the bill.  We continue to play games because we think that, in a way, we will compel people to vote for something they don't want to vote for--and, in my view, are not going to vote for. I think it's sad. I think we continue to demagogue this institution and its Members. That's sad. We leaders should not do that. This is a serious bill.  Now, I want to tell the gentleman from Michigan, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, I know what the debt is. And I know that debt has been incurred because we bought a lot of things we didn't pay for, including over $1 trillion of Afghanistan and Iraq, including a prescription drug bill that projects over $2 trillion, including tax cuts that were $2.3 trillion that not a penny were paid for. I understand, and I think it's serious.  The sad thing is that this is not a serious response. This is an irresponsible response. This is a response that, as I said earlier, says that we will pay some people first, but we won't pay all our debts. The richest country on the face of the Earth, the most creditworthy nation on the face of the Earth, we won't pay all our debts.  There is a simple way to do this: stop demagoguing one another. And I want to say to the gentleman, as he knows, Democrats have demagogued this issue when we've had Republican Presidents and Republicans have demagogued it when we've had Democratic Presidents.  We all know that we've incurred debts and we're going to pay them. That's all this is. It's very simple: we're either going to pay our debts or we're not.  Now, I want to tell my friend, the gentleman from Michigan, I know about the debt. The gentleman refers to $5 trillion. I'm sure the gentleman knows these statistics:  Under Ronald Reagan, the debt was increased 189 percent; under George Bush, 55 percent--the first George Bush, 55 percent; under this President so far, a little over 40 percent.
