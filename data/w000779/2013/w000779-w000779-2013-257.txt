President, I rise today to introduce the Geothermal Expansion Production Act of 2013. This legislation is the same as a bill reported favorably by voice vote by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources during the 112th Congress. This bill has bi-partisan support, with Senators Murkowski, Begich, Crapo, Risch, and Merkley, joining me as original cosponsors. The legislation will help to encourage the production of geothermal energy from public lands.  With limited exceptions, current law requires that all Federal lands to be leased for the development of geothermal resources be offered on a competitive basis. BLM must hold a competitive lease sale every 2 years. If bids are not received for the lands offered, BLM must offer the lands on a noncompetitive basis for 2 years.  This legislation extends the authority for noncompetitive leasing in cases where a geothermal developer wants to gain access to Federal land immediately adjacent to land on which that developer has proven that there is a geothermal resource that will be developed. This will allow a geothermal project to expand onto adjacent land, if necessary, to increase the amount of geothermal energy it can develop. It will also add to the royalties and rents that the project pays to the U.S. Treasury.  The reason for this legislation is to allow the rapid expansion of already identified geothermal resources without the additional delays of competitive leasing and without opening up those adjacent properties to speculative bidders who have no interest in actually developing the resource, only in extracting as much money as they can from the existing geothermal developer.  The bill is not a give away at taxpayer expense. The bill limits the amount of adjacent Federal land that can be leased to 640 acres. This lease on Federal land must be acquired at fair-market value. The bill also requires the lease holder to pay the higher annual rental rate associated with competitive leases even though this new parcel is not being competitively leased. Again, the purpose of this higher rental rate is to ensure that taxpayers will get the revenue due to them from the use of their public lands.  I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this important legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:                                 S. 363       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Geothermal Production      Expansion Act of 2013''.     SEC. 2. NONCOMPETITIVE LEASING OF ADJOINING AREAS FOR                    DEVELOPMENT OF GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES.       Section 4(b) of the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 (30 U.S.C.      1003(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``(4) Adjoining land.--       ``(A) Definitions.--In this paragraph:       ``(i) Fair market value per acre.--The term `fair market      value per acre' means a dollar amount per acre that--       ``(I) except as provided in this clause, shall be equal to      the market value per acre (taking into account the      determination under subparagraph (B)(iii) regarding a valid      discovery on the adjoining land) as determined by the      Secretary under regulations issued under this paragraph;
