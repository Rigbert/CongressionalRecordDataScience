Mr. Chairman, I would say to the gentleman that the language in our amendment says if the President can certify that there is no more forced abortion, and if they get out of China, which is what we are advocating, because they have had this duplicitous, egregious policy, working hand in glove with the dictatorship, we are saying get out and they get their full $25 million. And there will also probably be about $400 million of other family planning money that is also in the bill that is conditioned by the first part of the amendment.
