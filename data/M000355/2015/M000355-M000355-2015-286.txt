 President, if there is no further business to come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the provisions of S. Res. 309 as a further mark of respect to the late Fred Thompson, former Senator from Tennessee.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 5:53 p.m., adjourned until Monday, November 9, 2015, at 3 p.m.
