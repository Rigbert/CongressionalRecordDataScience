President, there is a crisis facing the steel industry in the United States, a crisis that has left over 10,000 steelworkers out of jobs and could jeopardize the jobs of thousands of additional workers. This disruption is a result of subsidized and dumped goods coming into the United States from a variety of countries--from Russia, from Japan, from Brazil, from Indonesia--at far under the cost of production and far under the price the steel is being sold in those countries.  While our existing laws and administrative procedures are in place and we've received favorable preliminary indications from administration officials, the time it takes to process these cases is too long and does not respond to a situation as dire as ours quickly enough. For example, hot-rolled carbon steel dumping petitions filed in September 1998, a full 10 months after the import surge began, were only recently decided. Under current law, industries and workers must wait until the injury has occurred or is so imminent as to be unavoidable to file a section 201 case.  Meanwhile, steelworkers continue to lose their jobs and the steel industry is suffering tremendous losses from which it may not easily recover. I shouldn't have to remind anyone that five American steel companies have declared bankruptcy and two of them are in the State of Illinois (LaClede Steel in Alton, IL, and Acme Steel in Riverside, IL) and at least 10,000 of the Nation's 170,000 steelworkers have been laid off. Illinois is one of the top steel producing States and we're proud of our steelworkers, the industry, and the products that they make for the American people and the world.  It is my belief that we should approach this situation with both short-term and long-term strategies that will complement each other and produce the maximum benefit for the U.S. economy, the steelworkers, and the industry. First, steel mills need access to capital to stay open and to keep their workers on the job, producing the finest and best steel in the world. That's a short-term approach that will help the industry and the workers when they need it most: now. And that's an approach that we take with this bill: H.R. 1664, Byrd-Domenici Steel Oil and Gas Loan Guarantee Program.  H.R. 1664 would provide a short-term, GATT legal, guaranteed loan program to address the cash flow emergency created by the historic steel import surge. The maximum aggregate amount of a loan guarantee that could be available to a single company would be $250 million. The guarantees provided to U.S. steel mills would be 6 years in duration, would require the commitment of collateral, and would require a fee to be paid by the borrower to cover the cost of administering the program. The level of guarantees to be provided to a steel mill would be 85 percent.  Finally, a board would be created in order to implement a steel loan guarantee program that provides maximum benefits to the U.S. steel industry and protection to the taxpayers.  Second, we need to put more teeth into current trade laws. Specifically, we should strengthen section 201 language by removing a very high causation standard and replacing that standard with a lower threshold by which U.S. industries and workers can prove their cases more easily. Let me state for the Record that if we reform our trade laws and we ensure our trading partners know we are serious about enforcing those laws, the incentive to dump steel or other imported products will be reduced. I liken this to the Senate filibuster. The threat of a filibuster may be far more effective than the actual filibuster itself. Similarly, the threat of more readily-proven dumping cases may, in fact, make a country think twice about dumping a product illegally into this country. Legislation was recently marked up in the Finance Committee that addressed the issue of section 201 and we should have a healthy debate about that as well.  In the meantime, Mr. President, we have a responsibility as Senators to address this issue as well as the serious situation the oil and gas industries is currently experiencing; and, I hope we can find a consensus solution that will help both these backbones of the U.S. industrial sector.                          ____________________
