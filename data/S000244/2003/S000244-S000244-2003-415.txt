Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, today is a victory for those Americans who work hard, pay their bills, but are forced to shoulder the debts of those who abuse our bankruptcy system. H.R. 975 restores personal responsibility and integrity to our bankruptcy system by offering a fresh start to those who deserve one, while cracking down on those who do not.  All Americans suffer when people who have the ability to pay their bills do not do so. Just yesterday the Spiegel Group, an entity that owns the famous Spiegel Catalogue and the Eddie Bauer stores, filed for bankruptcy. Why? This company, founded in 1871, began offering credit to its customers under the slogan ``We trust the people.''  According to one news report, however, the company trusted too many people, and some did not pay their credit card bills. Analysts estimate that the default rate with respect to Spiegel's credit card receivables ranged from 17 to 20 percent.  When businesses hurt, their employees and investors hurt, and our economy suffers. America's bankruptcy system was established to help provide a fresh start for individuals with demonstrated financial need. H.R. 975 maintains this goal by providing relief to those who truly require financial protection as a result of unexpected medical bills, unemployment, or other legitimate needs.  Our bankruptcy system was also established to encourage the reliable collection of debt owed to creditors. The measure we consider today advances both of these objectives and provides a comprehensive framework to promote the integrity of our bankruptcy system.  Take, for example, homestead exemptions. We have all heard about the former corporate executives acquiring or building multibillion-dollar mansions in the very face of those shareholders who are defrauded by such individuals.  I am particularly pleased that this legislation places reasonable monetary limitations on unlimited homestead exemptions which have often been misused by debtors to unfairly evade their financial obligations. This legislation will keep crooked corporate executives from using bankruptcy to shield their mansions and penthouses from the claims of creditors, defrauded shareholders, and employees.  In addition, H.R. 975 includes numerous proconsumer provisions. The bill includes special protection for individuals with spousal and child support claims. In addition to giving these claims the highest priority in regard to payment, it expands the definition of these claims to include obligations that are accruable before or after a bankruptcy case is filed, and requires deadbeat parents to pay those debts even after filing bankruptcy relief.  H.R. 975 exempts from the claims of creditors certain retirement pension funds and educational IRAs for the debtor's children. It mandates that credit lenders give consumer borrowers more disclosure about the adverse consequences of just paying the minimum monthly payment.  The bill requires debtors to receive credit counseling before they can be eligible for bankruptcy relief, so that they will make an informed choice about bankruptcy, its alternatives, and its consequences.                              {time}  1400  In several significant respects, H.R. 975 helps our Nation's family farmers in financial distress. It makes Chapter 12, a specialized form of bankruptcy relief, a permanent component of the bankruptcy codes. It ensures that more family farmers will be eligible for Chapter 12 by easing some of the income and debt limitations that currently restrict access to this type of bankruptcy relief; and for the first time family fishermen will be eligible to file for relief under Chapter 12.  H.R. 975 authorizes the increases of 28 additional bankruptcy judgeships. According to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, the workload of bankruptcy judges has increased 52 percent since 1992, which was the last time additional bankruptcy judges were authorized.  Another major reform of H.R. 975 deals with the economic stability of our Nation's financial marketplace. The bill includes provisions intended to reduce systemic risk with respect to the setoff or netting of various financial transactions. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan has described the enactment of these provisions as being extremely important. Finally, H.R. 975 addresses problems presented by the inconsistent and unpredictable current state of bankruptcy laws concerning the treatment of bankrupt multinational corporations. It largely codifies the Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency to ensure greater legal certainties for trade and investment, as well as provide for the fair and efficient administration of these cases.  The time for these reforms is long overdue. This body has on six previous occasions passed similar bankruptcy reform bills. It is my hope that today we will again do the right thing and pass this needed bipartisan bankruptcy reform legislation. Perhaps the seventh attempt will prove to be a charm and finally lead to the enactment of these critically important reforms.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
