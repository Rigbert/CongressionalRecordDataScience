Everyone agrees that Chapter 12 has worked. It is time for Congress to make Chapter 12 a permanent part of the Bankruptcy Code to provide a stable safety net for our Nation's family farmers.  I will continue to work with Senator Grassley, Senator Feingold, Representative Baldwin, Representative Nick Smith and others on both sides of the aisle to pass legislation that once and for all assures our farmers of permanent bankruptcy protections to help them keep their farms. In the meantime, the House of Representatives should quickly pass the Family Farmer Bankruptcy Relief Act and end the current lapse in basic bankruptcy protections for our family farmers.                                                  October 6, 2004.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: The undersigned organizations urge      immediate passage of S. 2864 that reinstates Chapter 12      bankruptcy provisions of our nation's family farmers. Since      January 1, 2004 farmers facing serious financial problems      resulting from low commodity prices, increasing production      costs, and natural disasters have not been able to consider      filing a Chapter 12 bankruptcy.       The need for a separate bankruptcy code that enables      farmers to stay on the land while reorganizing their debt is      as urgent now as it was in 1986 when initially enacted by      Congress. This lapse in coverage results in farmers having to      face foreclosure and liquidation. Instead, Chapter 12 would      offer farmers the opportunity to negotiate with their      creditors. This benefits the farm family, their creditors and      rural businesses.       Please act quickly. Every day that Congress delays on      Chapter 12 has a direct cost to our nation's family farmers      and rural communities.           Sincerely,       American Corn Growers Association.
