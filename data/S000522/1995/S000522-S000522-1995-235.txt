Mr. Speaker, I welcome reports that NATO planes struck targets near the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale today after militant forces ignored a U.N. ultimatum to surrender heavy weapons they seized from U.N. weapons dumps around Sarajevo earlier this week. According to Reuters, six aircraft, including U.S. warplanes, bombed a Bosnian Serb ammunition depot in response to a request from U.N. peacekeepers. This rare display of muscle to quell attacks against Sarajevo, a U.N.-designated safehaven, is long overdue. Perhaps these airstrikes signal a resolve by the international community to take a firm stand against armed aggression and those responsible for genocide in Bosnia.  I applaud the Clinton administration for fully backing the NATO raids which were a response to what Secretary of Defense Perry characterized as reprehensible attacks around the Bosnian capital. Mr. Speaker, it is high time that determined action, such as today's airstrikes, be directed against those who flagrantly defy the will of the international community, as the Bosnian Serbs have repeatedly done.                          ____________________
