 1898. A bill to establish the Green River National Wildlife Refuge in the State of Kentucky; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Green River National Wildlife Refuge Act of 2002. Seven years ago Kentucky was the only State in the Nation that did not have its own national wildlife refuge. I was proud to remedy this problem by helping enact legislation to establish the Clarks River National Wildlife Refuge in Marshall County, KY. Nearly half of the targeted 18,000 acres have been acquired for this refuge, all from willing sellers. And this spring, the refuge headquarters building will be completed.  Given the success and progress of the Clarks River refuge, I am proud to partner with the efforts of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to establish Kentucky's second national wildlife refuge on approximately 23,000 acres in Henderson County along the confluence of the Green River and the Ohio River. This targeted refuge area will provide a diverse array of conservation, recreation, and environmental education opportunities for everyone from tourists to wildlife enthusiasts to local school groups.  The proposed refuge site in the Green River bottoms area was once part of a large bottomland hardwood forest. Although this wetland area has largely been replaced by agriculture, it serves as a popular spot for a variety of waterfowl and migratory birds, especially when desirable water levels occur. In fact, on February 1, 1999, more than 10,000 ducks and 8,000 geese were recorded as visitors to the Green River area. The site also is home to several endangered or threatened species, such as the fanshell, Indiana bat maternity colonies, the copperbelly snake, and a number of different mussels. Establishing a refuge in this area offers a valuable opportunity to restore hardwood forest to the Green River bottoms area, which will, in turn, help provide a safe and fruitful habitat for migratory birds and wildlife and help stop the erosion that threatens to change the course of the Ohio River.  Outdoor recreationalists, including hunters, fishermen, birdwatchers, nature photographers, will enjoy many benefits from the protection and restoration of a diverse and thriving wildlife habitat. Indeed, the proposed refuge area already hosts a large population of white-tailed deer, gray squirrel, catfish, and carp, which will provide exceptional hunting and fishing opportunities.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service already has taken significant steps to make the Green River National Wildlife Refuge a reality. I think it is important, however, to ensure that any land acquired for this refuge is obtained only from willing sellers, just as is the case with Clarks River National Wildlife Refuge. Although I understand that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has no plans to condemn private property for the refuge, I believe that the landowners in Henderson County deserve a legislative guarantee to assure that the Refuge will not infringe upon their rights as private property owners. My legislation would provide that guarantee.  I look forward to partnering with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to bring this project to fruition, and I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this bill, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1898       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Green River National      Wildlife Refuge Act of 2002''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) the Green River bottoms area, Kentucky, was once part      of a large bottomland hardwood forest;       (2) most of the bottoms area has been converted to      agricultural use through--       (A) draining of wetland;       (B) altering of interior drainage systems; and       (C) clearing of bottomland hardwood forest;       (3) as of the date of enactment of this Act, the bottoms      area is predominantly ridge and swale farmland, with river-     scar oxbows, several sloughs, wet depression areas, and a      small quantity of bottomland hardwood forest;       (4) approximately 1,200 acres of bottomland hardwood forest      remain, consisting mostly of cypress, willow, hackberry,      silver maple, ash, and buttonbush;       (5) many of the interior drainage systems on the land offer      excellent opportunities to restore, with minor modifications,      the historical hydrology, wetland, and bottomland hardwood      forest of the bottoms area to high-quality wildlife habitats;       (6) in the bottoms area, waterfowl occur in large numbers      when sufficient water levels occur, primarily when flood      conditions from the Ohio River and the Green River negate the      extensive drainages and alterations made by man;       (7) the wooded and shrub tracts of the bottoms area are      used by many species of nongame neotropical migratory birds;       (8) migratory shorebirds use the bottoms area during spring      migrations;       (9) wading birds such as snipe, great blue heron, green      heron, common egret, and great egret frequent the bottoms      area;       (10) bald eagles and myriad other raptors frequent the      bottoms area;       (11) several species listed as endangered or threatened      species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C.      1531 et seq.) have been found near the bottoms area,      including Indiana bat maternity colonies, fanshell, pink      mucket pearly mussel, and fat pocketbook;       (12) several species of mussel listed as endangered or      threatened species under that Act historically occurred near      the bottoms area, including purple cat's paw pearly mussel,      tubercled-blossom pearly mussel, ring pink, and white      wartyback pearly mussel;       (13) the copperbelly water snake, covered by the      Copperbelly Water Snake Conservation Plan, is found in the      wetland complex and buttonbush shrub in the Scuffletown area;       (14) significant populations of resident game species,      including white-tailed deer, swamp rabbit, cottontail rabbit,      gray squirrel, mink, muskrat, beaver, fox, and coyote, occur      in the bottoms area;       (15) the Ohio River and the Green River are important      habitat for big river species such as paddlefish, sturgeon,      catfish, carp, buffalo, and gar;       (16) conservation, enhancement, and ecological restoration      of the bottoms area through inclusion in the National      Wildlife Refuge System would help meet the habitat      conservation goals of--       (A) the North American Waterfowl Management Plan;       (B) the Lower Mississippi Joint Venture;       (C) the Interior Low Plateaus Bird Conservation Plan; and       (D) the Copperbelly Water Snake Conservation Plan;       (17) the valuable complex of wetland habitats comprising      the bottoms area, with its many forms of wildlife, has      extremely high recreational value for hunters, anglers,      birdwatchers, nature photographers, and others; and       (18) the Green River bottoms area is deserving of inclusion      in the National Wildlife Refuge System.     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.       The purpose of this Act is to establish the Green River      National Wildlife Refuge in the Green River bottoms area,      Henderson County, Kentucky, to provide--       (1) habitat for migrating and wintering waterfowl;       (2) habitat for nongame land birds;       (3) habitats for a natural diversity of fish and wildlife;       (4) nesting habitat for wood ducks and other locally      nesting migratory waterfowl;       (5) high-quality hunting and sportfishing opportunities;      and       (6) opportunities for environmental education,      interpretation, and wildlife-oriented recreation.
