 What I am asking the Senator from Colorado is this: Taking into consideration the language that is now being presented in this Defense authorization bill, particularly section 1032, it is my understanding the Federal Bureau of Investigation could not have continued their interrogation of this suspected terrorist without first contacting our military and bringing them in to determine whether they had jurisdiction over this matter. In other words, time would have been lost, opportunities would have been lost, information might have been lost by following the new section in the bill.  I am asking the Senator from Colorado if this is a decision which he believes we should make in the haste of a Defense authorization bill or ought to step back and work with the President of the United States, the FBI, the military, and our intelligence forces to make sure we do not lose an opportunity to catch an alleged terrorist, to interrogate them, and to keep this country safe.
