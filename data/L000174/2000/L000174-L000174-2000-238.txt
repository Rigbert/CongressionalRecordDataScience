President, I am pleased to join Senators Kennedy, Dodd, and Mack in introducing this resolution on police reform in Northern Ireland.  Police reform is necessary in Northern Ireland to guarantee fairness and to advance the peace process.  Our resolution expresses the Sense of the Senate that the full and speedy implementation of the Patten Commission's recommendations on reforming the police service in Northern Ireland holds the promise of ensuring that the police service will gain the support of both nationalists and unionists. It calls on the British Government to fully and faithfully implement the recommendations included in the Patten Commission report. It also commends the parties to the Good Friday Agreement for progress to date in implementing all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement and urges them to move expeditiously to complete the implementation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that documents which raise concerns about police reform legislation be included at the end of my remarks. I urge my colleagues to approve this resolution.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 Lawyers Committee                                             for Human Rights,                                      New York, NY, June 16, 2000.     Re Northern Ireland police bill.     The Rt. Hon. Peter Mandelson,     Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Northern Ireland          Office, Stormont Castle, Belfast, Northern Ireland.       Dear Mr. Mandelson: We are writing to you to convey our      continued concern about the proposed Northern Ireland Police      Bill. We recognise the difficult choices you face in      implementing a comprehensive program of police reform in      Northern Ireland. We are aware also of the deep sensitivities      surrounding the police issues that cut across religious,      racial and political lines. We commend you for the time and      attention you have directed to this highly important subject.      It is precisely because it is so important that we write to      you again following our letter on May 26, to register      concerns that arise out of the debate at the Second Reading      of the Bill.       At the Reading, you emphasised the need to concentrate on      ``detail'' and to move away from ``rhetoric'' and      ``hyperbole''. We agree, and recognise that this is a      critical time to ensure that the legislation accurately      embodies the recommendations made by the Patten Commission.      However, we take strong exception to your assertion that the      ``spirit as well as the letter'' of the Bill you are      proposing fully implements the Patten Commission's      recommendations. To the contrary, we are greatly concerned      that the proposed legislation fails to implement key elements      of the Patten Commission's Recommendations especially      relating to Police accountability.                  police ombudsman and policing board       In particular, the legislation significantly curtails the      powers of the Police Ombudsman and the Policing Board. In      fact, as it now stands, the legislation appears to undermine      the very mechanism that the Patten Commission envisaged as      necessary for holding the police force and its Chief      accountable.     a. Police Ombudsman       With respect to the power of the Police Ombudsman, the      Patten Commission recommended that:       ``[The Ombudsman] should exercise the power to initiate      inquiries and investigations even if no specific complaint      has been received . . . (and) should exercise the right to      investigate and comment on police policies and practices,      where these are perceived to give rise to difficulties.''      (Recommendation 38).       In rejecting both the spirit and the letter of this      recommendation, you indicated at the Second Reading that you      believed you were right ``to resist the suggestion that the      Ombudsman should also have powers to review the policies and      practices of the police service.'' You proposed, instead,      that she would be able to raise wider issues only in the      course of investigating individual complaints.       The government's proposal, if accepted, will create a      system that would allow the Ombudsman to only address      patterns of misconduct by chance. Such an inquiry would only      be triggered if a person happens to come forward with an      individual complaint that also reveals a wider issue. This is      contrary to the Patten Commission's recommendation, and does      not seem the most effective way to monitoring police      adherence to human rights standards.     b. Policing Board       In proposing the creation of a police board, the Patten      Commission recognised that the Board could only be effective      if it were independent and powerful. (see Patten Report,      paragraph 6.23). The Commission proposed that the Policing      Board have power to initiate inquiries so that it had an      alternative mechanisms to ensure accountability, and not be      limited to the extreme remedy of calling upon the Chief      Constable to retire.       In rejecting this recommendation, the proposed legislation      bars the Policing Board's ability to inquire into past      misconduct and gives the Secretary of State the power to      prevent the Ombudsman from doing so. Although we are pleased      that you have indicated your initial proposal has ``probably      gone too far in the limitations'' imposed on the Policing      Board's powers, we are concerned that you appear to still      believe that the power to initiate inquiries is `extreme'.       We urge you to ensure that the legislation reflects the      Patten Commission's major emphasis on the centrality of human      rights by granting these monitoring bodies the power proposed      by the Commission.                         oversight commissioner       The new Oversight Commissioner, Mr. Constantine, will have      a critically important role in implementing police reform and      restructuring. The Patten Commission's Report proposed wide      powers and latitude for the Oversight Commissioner. We are      pleased that the Commissioner's terms of reference will have      a statutory basis, and we look forward to studying the      amendments brought forward on this point. We consider it      vital that the Oversight Commissioner's mandate relates to      his responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the      breadth of change envisaged in the Patten Commission's      recommendations, and not simply the Implementation Plan. From      a cursory reading of the Implementation Plan, it is clear      that it rests considerable discretion in the Chief Constable,      a constraint that is at odds with the overall approach      envisioned by the Patten Report. We strongly urge that the      Commission's written terms of reference give him the broadest      scope, latitude and independence possible to enable him to      effectively carry out his essential mission.                         human rights standards       Finally, we are concerned that the Bill fails to establish      adequate means for incorporating a human rights culture into      policing in Northern Ireland. Members of the Patten      Commission understood that international norms are important      safeguards to both ``the public and to the police officers      carrying out their duties.'' (Recommendation 5.17). The      Police Bill should reflect this principle at every      opportunity--in defining the function of the Police Board,      the role of the police, and organising principles of the Code      of Ethics.       Official accountability is an essential key to building      public confidence in a new policing institution in Northern      Ireland. I am sure you can appreciate that without this      public credibility, all reform efforts will be seriously      undermined. You have been presented with a unique opportunity      to institute effective and lasting reforms within the police      in Northern Ireland which puts a premium on respect for human      rights. If successful, the Northern Ireland experience could      become a model for other countries around the world embarking      on their own path to reform. But success must be built on a      legislative framework that ensures the fullest official      accountability.       We will continue to closely monitor the development of this      legislation. We look forward to hearing from you and would      welcome the opportunity to meet with you or your      representatives to discuss these issues further.           Respectfully,                                                   Michael Posner,     Executive Director.                                  ____       Police Bill Looks Set to Render Policing Board Ineffective       The Police Authority today expressed ``deep concern'' about      the new Police (NI) Bill 2000.       Authority Chairman Pat Armstrong stressed that although the      body was reluctant to criticise new legislation it felt it      had no alternative.       ``The Police Authority hoped to have been able to give the      same broad welcome to this Bill which it gave to the Patten      report when it was published.       ``We want to see policing in Northern Ireland move forward.      Although the main public focus on this legislation so far has      been about the name and symbols of the police service, we      feel that damaging limitations on the powers of the new      Policing Board represent the real meat of the debate.       ``The Police Authority has worked vigilantly for the last      thirty years to ensure police accountability to the people of      Northern Ireland and to protect the police service from      political intervention. In doing so we have made no secret of      the fact that our powers have always been severely limited by      the restrictions imposed on us by successive Secretaries of      State.       ``We therefore welcomed Patten's proposal and believed it      would at long last create a strong, independent and powerful      Policing Board for the community at large.       ``Worryingly, the early signs in this Bill are that the      Secretary of State is trying to curb the powers of this new      Board and substantially weaken its credibility before it even      gets off the ground.       ``While we haven't had the opportunity to analyze the full      impact of the Secretary of     State's proposals, it seems that if the legislation goes      through as it stands, the new Policing Board could actually      have less power then the current Police Authority--a      situation we find ludicrous and totally unacceptable.''       ``Police planning and financial control are two key areas      where it seems the new Board will have a reduced role, while      the Secretary of State enjoys greater influence.       ``And where the Board was supposed to get new powers, it      seems rigid restrictions have been imposed. On the power to      initiate enquiries for example, it is difficult to see how      the Board could ever satisfy all the conditions required by      the Secretary of State.''       ``This is not the first time that Government has attempted      to control policing in Northern Ireland. In our original      submission to the Patten Commission we catalogued consistent      attempts by the Government over the years to suppress the      powers of the Police Authority.       ``Successive Authorities have resisted such attempts by      Government to directly influence policing and we will      continue to do so in guarding against any weakening of the      powers envisaged by Patten for the new Policing Board. The      Patten report itself stated, `we do not believe the Secretary      of State . . . should ever appear to have the power to direct      the police.'--this obviously signalled a clear intention on      the Commission's part to curtail the powers of Government--     not enhance them as the proposed legislation seems set to      do.''       Mr. Armstrong however said the Authority supported much of      the legislation including the apparent safeguards put in      place to prevent District Policing Partnerships raising money      for `freelance' police services. He added that more time      would be needed to examine all the issues in detail.       The Authority will shortly publish an in-depth analysis of      the Government's proposed Patten legislation and      implementation plan.                          ____________________
