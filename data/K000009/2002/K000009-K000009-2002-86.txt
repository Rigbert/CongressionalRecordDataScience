Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Carson) for bringing us together for this very important discussion and also want to compliment the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Etheridge) for doing such a fine job in simplifying what could be a complicated debate.  I wanted to add my words this afternoon to the very important issue of Social Security, probably the premier program of the last century, that helped lift one-third of the Nation out of poverty. Even today, if you think about many of our seniors, certainly women, the majority receive checks in a month that average maybe around $550, $580 per month. Social Security for them is not pocket change; it is a lifeline. Without Social Security and Medicare, they simply could not survive.  So you would think America, during this period of the stunning collapse of Enron, would have learned an important lesson, and that certain Members of this Congress who are trying to tinker around with Social Security would have learned an important lesson, and that is that the vagaries of the market and the private sector's penchant for gambling with other people's money is no substitute, can never be a substitute, for the rock-solid guarantee of Social Security, an insurance program and a disability program. Any one of us, any one of our family members, can be struck by a disability. Social Security is the social safety net for this country.  Yet what we see in the Bush administration's proposal in the wake of Enron is not retirement security, but retirement insecurity. In fact, the lockbox that the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Etheridge) referenced, wherewe all promised we would not touch the Social Security trust fund, in that in fact that trust fund would be there to pay dollars, the billions of dollars to our seniors across this country this year, next year, and as the baby boom generation retires, what the Bush administration is actually doing is taking these dollars and giving them away; and it is giving them away by the billions.  How is that actually happening? It is happening because this trust fund is being borrowed from now to pay tax rebates to some of the wealthiest and most profitable corporations in our country, not just this year, but over the next 10 years.  If you think about who is getting the benefit, let us take a look at Enron. If you look at the tax proposals that were passed here in this House, which I did not support, what they essentially meant was that we are taking money from the trust fund, and we are giving it to companies like Enron.  Enron, unless we stop it, is going to be getting rebates, rebates that basically are transfers from the trust fund which are the accumulated savings of the American people, taken out of every worker's check, and put there for their parents or grandparents. Those dollars are being transferred, not by the thousands, not even by the millions, but by the billions, which is the amount that is in the trust fund; and if you take Enron, for example, just in the years we are serving here, the first 3 years they probably will get $350 million in rebates.  Guess where that comes from? It comes from the one source of accumulated savings that the American people have, and that is the Social Security trust fund. So my aunt in Toledo and maybe your grandmother in Chicago, those savings that are there are being transferred because of consolidated accounting.  The Republican Party has invaded the lockbox that we promised would be there in perpetuity. Overall, the numbers show that the Congressional Budget Office projected a 10-year non-Social Security surplus of $3.1 trillion; and now, just 1 year later, that projection has plunged to a deficit of $742 billion, almost $1 trillion. So the surplus that had existed technically in the annual budgets has been turned almost overnight into a deficit, and the borrowing is continuing from the Social Security trust fund.  Now, Enron just does not get a little bit. I mean, $350 million in rebates, that is one-third of $1 billion. None of my relatives can even imagine how much money that really is. But that is what is going on here. And if there is any program that has marked the Democratic Party, and in fact it is one of the reasons I am a Democrat, is because of this Social Security program. It meant the difference for our grandmother between the poor house and being able to live out her final years in dignity. It was very meager, but at least it was something. It was something. To see this program violated for the likes of a chief executive officer like Ken Lay is absolutely abhorrent to me.  If I look at other corporations that are benefiting and the money coming out of the Social Security trust fund and going to them, we can look at General Electric, because General Electric is one of the companies that is not just going to get millions. Enron is going to get millions; General Electric is going to get billions out of the Social Security trust fund.  With the changes in the alternative minimum tax, it means that all of these little tax breaks and loopholes that the very well-paid accountants from companies like Arthur Andersen can find for these large corporations, they are going to get rebates through the Social Security trust fund, which sounds incredible because we were supposed to have put it in a lockbox and not touched it, and yet it is being drawn down to give money back to really the wealthiest people in our country and the wealthiest interests.                              {time}  1600  And they are not having trouble. These companies like General Electric, they are not going bankrupt. Now, Enron went bankrupt because of wrongdoing, criminal wrongdoing, it appears. And many of these other corporations, take Chevron, take Texaco, we are not talking about pennies, we are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars. The Social Security Trust Fund is being invaded to give nearly $200 million to Texaco, three-quarters of a billion dollars to Chevron. Think about that. Think about the transfer of wealth that is occurring.  So some people are saying, well, let a senior family or someone who is going to be of retirement age someday, let them put money aside. We just have to encourage responsibility in the American people. How do we do that on minimum wage? How do we do that when we do not earn a minimum wage? How do we do that when we have no health benefits?  Yesterday I sat in the Committee on Veterans Affairs thinking about this Special Order tonight and the fact that we were taking money out of Social Security Trust Fund to give it to some of the wealthiest corporations in the country, and we have a proposal from the Bush administration to charge veterans for prescription drugs. Now, we have always had a $2 copayment for various prescriptions, and many of our veterans average 10 prescriptions per month. What the Bush administration is doing is raising that copayment to $7 per prescription which, per month, would be $70, with a cap annually of over $850 for prescription drugs for veterans.  I am sitting there and thinking, well, is this not interesting. We hear all of these patriotic speeches on behalf of our military; and yet, when it comes to serving those who have put their life on the line, then, as they are very elderly and unable to fend for themselves, they say, now you have to pay additional money for prescription drugs. Is that what Lincoln had in mind when he said we would care for the veteran, his widow, his orphan? Is that the promise? Was it a false promise that was made?  So what we see happening is, why are we charging for prescription drugs for veterans, for those who have created and preserved the freedom that we have here in this country? Why are we charging them? Because we have to borrow. We have to take the money that should be placed into paying for those pharmaceuticals for those who have served our Nation. We are giving it away. We are giving it away to Enron in rebates, we are giving it away to General Motors in rebates, we are giving it away to Chevron in rebates, we are giving it away to IBM in rebates. That is where the money is going.  So I want to say to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Carson), I am really very pleased that he has taken the leadership in pulling this together today, because this truly is; this is not a tangential issue for the Democratic Party, this is the core of the Democratic Party.  I was here in 1983 when we saved Social Security. It was the key issue in the election of 1992, along with the recession. We were able to reconstitute a healthy Social Security Trust Fund which served us well into this millennium. I am certainly one Member that will do nothing to weaken the system.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a Democrat. I am proud to be holding the Social Security Trust Fund in our hands, and we literally do, and preserving it for the American people for this generation and generations to come.  I thank the gentleman again for giving this time this evening and urge him on in his efforts to inform the American public and to re-create that lockbox permanently.
