Mr. Chairman, through you to my colleagues, it has been 43 years that we have had this embargo with Cuba. It has not worked. It seems to me we should do one of two things: we should either make the pain greater for the Cuban people, as we so with the embargo, or we should make some changes to improve communications.  How do we make those kind of changes? One change that I think of is perestroika in Russia. In the late 80s, when more open communication was started, when the Russian people started learning about what America was and what we were doing, we saw the beginning of change in Russia.  How can we better communicate with the Cuban people? I was down in Cuba about a year and a half ago, and most people of Cuba that I talked to do not seem to really know what America is all about, what the free market and free enterprise and liberty is all about. Of course, because under Castro they have not had it.  I think it should be clear that none of us support Castro. None of us disagree that Castro is bad. None of us disagree it would be good to have Castro out of the way. The question is, how do we do something better than what we have done for the last 43 years?  We talk about some of the prisoners, saying, keep up the pain and keep your embargo going. I would quote one of the prisoners, Espenosa Chapa, who said, ``The policy of isolating Cuba, far from bringing freedom, has only served to give the regime an alibi that the embargo is the cause of all the ills the country suffers, and it has kept Cuban society away from a greater flow of democratic ideas and values.''  The current ban on travel is only one element of the embargo. Mr. Chairman, I would say it is somewhat akin to increased free trade worldwide where there is freer interaction and more open communication.  So I just call on my colleagues, do not go along with the status quo. Let us make a change, because the last 43 years have not accomplished the goals that we want to accomplish. Support the Flake amendment.                              {time}  1500
