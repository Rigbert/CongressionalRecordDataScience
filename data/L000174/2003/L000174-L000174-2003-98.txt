President, I am pleased to take this opportunity to commend one of Vermont's most successful farmer-owned enterprises, the world-renowned Cabot Creamery of Vermont. Since its founding by 94 farmers in 1919, Cabot's farm families have preserved the heritage and proud agrarian traditions of the State of Vermont and our great nation.  Cabot has an 80-year history of doing what they do best, making the world's best cheddar cheeses. When Cabot Creamery earned the title of ``Best Cheddar in the World'' and ``Best Flavored Cheddar'' at the 22nd Biennial World Championship Cheese Contest, they did it as a team, steeped in family traditions and pride and with skill and expertise that has been painstakingly built over the generations. That same teamwork goes into every aspect of their business.  In 1992 Cabot joined forces with another New England farmer-owned cooperative, Agri-Mark Inc, to open new markets for Vermont dairy farmers. Today the cheese made by Cabot is from the milk of more than 1,450 Agri-Mark dairy producers throughout Vermont, New England and New York. The Cabot Creamery of Vermont combines the best aspects of both cooperative farming and value-added agricultural products to provide much-needed price premiums to Vermont dairy farmers.  The dairy farmers of Cabot Creamery also have a rich history in teaching their communities about the importance of dairy to the economy and to nutrition and health. Dairy products pack a powerful punch of eight additional nutrients needed for stronger bones and healthier bodies. Throughout New England, Cabot runs the Ag in the Classroom program, an educational program for elementary students that teaches them about agriculture. This program has been recognized by educators as a valuable resource that helps connect students to their communities, raises self-awareness and fosters creativity.  Cabot also has sponsored Calcium Crisis Challenge, a program for 6th--8th-grade students that helps them learn about calcium and its importance for stronger bones and healthy living. The program brings attention to the fact that more than 75 percent of Americans do not get enough calcium in their diets.  This week in Washington, D.C., the dairy farmers of Cabot Creamery will host a reception to highlight the national 3-A-Day education campaign. The 3-A-Day campaign is simple--three servings of milk, cheese or yogurt is a deliciously easy way to help build stronger bones and better bodies. Most Americans are eating only half the daily recommended servings of dairy each day, resulting in loss of bone density and in related health problems. Eating 3-A-Day of dairy is an easy and wholesome way for families to help meet their calcium needs.  Along with Senator Jeffords and Congressman Sanders, I am pleased to join Cabot's involvement with this important education campaign to highlight the importance of dairy products to healthy diets.                          ____________________
