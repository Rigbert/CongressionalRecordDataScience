Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life's work of Margaret Wuwert of Toledo, Ohio. After building the once-fledgling Children's Rights Council into the well-respected organization it has become, Margaret recently was retired from the organization which bears her imprimatur.  Margaret Wuwert joined the Children's Rights Council in 1995 and was appointed as Chapter Leader in Toledo, Ohio. In just five years, by 2000 she had implemented one of the best Supervised Visitation/Access Centers in the United States. So many families have been able to visit their children at these visitation/access sites. Margaret recruited and mentored many others to start sites in other communities. Always, with the goal of helping children and families, Margaret's enthusiasm for her work has been boundless and infectious.  Margaret has also been an honored member of the National Office in Washington, DC where her knowledge and experience have been much-valued at board meetings and conferences. Her passion is clear, endless, and passed on to everyone who met her.  With money often a concern in keeping sites open, Margaret ``worked day and night trying to get grant money and many times she gave up her own salary in order to not close the doors to Children's Rights Council'' according to one of her colleagues. Working with the family court system, Margaret developed relationships with judges, CASA volunteers and community leaders to move forward the goals of the Children's Rights Council. In her quiet and earnest way, Margaret was able to make the system of court ordered supervised visits work in the best way possible for children and parents.  As a colleague she mentored noted, ``The world is a better place because she cared about these children who had no way to see their other parent. There are not too many people like Margaret. If it were not for her. . . . life would be so much more complicated.''  Margaret Wuwert is a joyful soul who brought joy to families in tragic situations. Without her tireless efforts and dedication to her work, there would not be a Children's Rights Council able to offer the help to families it does today. For twenty years, Margaret Wuwert was the Children's Rights Council. She leaves shoes impossible to fill, but a strong organization which is integral to the needs of families who find themselves in the court system.  We thank Margaret Wuwert for her compassion, her spirit and her unending efforts as a leader with the Children's Rights Council. We wish for Margaret in retirement time to spend with those for whom she cares and doing that which she most enjoys.                          ____________________
