 I am not going to ask consent yet, but the plan is as follows: To stack three votes, first a vote on or in relation to the Durbin amendment, then on or in relation to the Bingaman amendment, then on or in relation to the Feinstein amendment. After that, we expect to be able to handle everything else by voice vote, including final passage.
