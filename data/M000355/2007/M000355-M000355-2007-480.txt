  It had been my hope that the House of Representatives would have appointed conferees on the supplemental appropriations bill for the troops before their departure. I think it is extremely important we finish that bill and get it down to the President for the veto we believe is forthcoming over the language with regard to the troops, the language which, in effect, dictates a withdrawal date and also the excessive spending that is also a part of thatbill. So the sooner we can get through this process, the better.  The Joint Chiefs of Staff sent a letter to me, week before last, indicating that if we push this into late April, it creates a lot of problems for the troops. So we hope we can get through this process, resolve our differences, and get the money for the troops at the earliest possible time.  As the majority leader has indicated, we will be going forward with the stem cell issue. There is an alternative proposal by Senator Coleman and Senator Isakson that we think solves some of the ethical concerns and which will be considered by the Senate. Both will be subjected to the 60-vote threshold, and it is my hope the Coleman-Isakson bill, which could be signed by the President and will actually make a difference, will make it through the legislative process and down to the President for his signature.  Madam President, I yield the floor.
