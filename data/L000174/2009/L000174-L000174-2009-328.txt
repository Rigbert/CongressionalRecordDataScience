I reiterate for my colleagues that this is a bill that, when it is voted upon, I predict--and I am fairly good about such predictions--will pass almost unanimously, certainly with 80 to 90 votes for it. We handled a number of amendments--mostly Republican amendments--and we either included them or voted them down. Most were included in this bill. Cloture was filed only because a huge number of amendments came in that had absolutely nothing to do with the jurisdiction of either the Judiciary Committee or this bill. That is the only way to get on to the bill and give our law enforcement the tools they need. Many law enforcement groups in this country has spoken in favor of this.  I ask unanimous consent that a group of letters from law enforcement organizations and other groups in favor of it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                National Fraternal                                              Order of Police,                                   Washington, DC, March 18, 2009.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman, I am writing on behalf of the members of      the Fraternal Order     of Police to advise you of our support for S. 386, the      ``Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act.''       This bill will strengthen our ability to investigate and      prosecute the kinds of financial crimes that have so severely      undermined our economy by providing law enforcement with the      tools they need to investigate fraudulent activity in      connection with bailout and recovery legislation,       The legislation you have introduced along with Senators      Grassley, Schumer, Klobuchar, and Kaufman will authorize $165      million a year for hiring fraud prosecutors and investigators      at the U.S. Department of Justice for FY2010 and 2011,      including specific funding for the Federal Bureau of      Investigation to hire additional special agents, professional      staff and forensic analysts to rebuild its ``white collar''      investigation program. The bill also authorizes $80 million a      year over the next two years for investigators and analysts      at the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the U.S. Secret      Service, and the Office of Inspector General for the Housing      and Urban Development Department to combat fraud against      Federal assistance programs and financial institutions.       Additionally, the bill will make changes to fraud and money      laundering statutes to enhance prosecutors' ability to combat      this growing wave of fraud and improve one of the most potent      civil tools we have for rooting out fraud in government--the      False Claims Act.       I applaud you for your leadership on this issue and look      forward to working with you and your staff to move this bill      forward. If I can be of any help, please do not hesitate to      contact me or Executive Director Jim Pasco through my      Washington office.           Sincerely,                                                 Chuck Canterbury,     National President.                                  ____                                      Taxpayers Against Fraud,                                                   Washington, DC.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Russell Senate Office          Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing to express Taxpayers      Against Fraud's support for the recently introduced Fraud      Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 (S. 386). Taxpayers      Against Fraud is dedicated to eradicating fraud against the      United States government. We strongly believe that this well-     reasoned legislation will serve that end, and will greatly      benefit the American people during this trying time. In      particular, the S.386 provisions closing False Claims Act      loopholes will prevent fraudsters from stealing tax dollars      with impunity.       Over the past twenty years, it has become utterly clear      that the government's most effective fraud-fighting tool is      the federal False Claims Act, returning over $22 billion in      settlements and judgments. However, recent court decisions      have interpreted the False Claims Act in ways inconsistent      with the Congressional intent, causing harm to taxpayers.      These judicial rulings could leave billions of federal      dollars exposed to fraud. Perhaps most disturbing, the      Supreme Court recently held that the False Claims Act does      not impose liability for false claims on government funds      disbursed by a government contractor for government purposes.      This ruling severely limits the reach of the False Claims      Act. S. 386 specifically addresses this Court ruling.      Therefore, during this time, when the government is      distributing unprecedented funds as part of the economic      recovery efforts, Congress is rightly seeking to strengthen      the False Claims Act, thus ensuring that every stimulus      dollar is appropriately spent to get our country back on      track.       We strongly support this legislation, and we encourage      others to join the fight in protecting Amercia's scarce      fiscal resources.           Sincerely,                                               Joseph E. B. White,     President & C.E.O.                                  ____                                           Federal Law Enforcement                                         Officers Association,                                   Lewisberry, PA, March 22, 2009.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: As the National President of the      Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA), a      26,000 member organization exclusively representing federal      law enforcement officers, I would like to commend you for      your introduction of Senate Bill 386, the Fraud Enforcement      and Recovery Act of 2009.       Three sections of the bill in particular are of great      importance to our membership. First, Subsection 27, paragraph      (1) seeks to define the term ``proceeds'' correctly as      relates to a money laundering violation (Title 18, USC 1956      C). Your bill will ensure that a criminal is charged for the      ``gross receipts'' they earned from a specified unlawful      activity. Money launderers should not be allowed to use      receipts from their criminal enterprise as a means to lower      the dollar amount for which they are criminally charged.       Under Section 3, paragraph (2) (A), your bill specifies      funding the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for fiscal      years 2010 and 2011. Specifically, your bill recommends      funding the FBI $65 million each year in an effort to combat      crimes involving ``federal assistance programs and financial      institutions.'' In light of the economic crisis our country      is facing, and the rampant fraud being committed against      programs designed to assist Americans, it is imperative that      the FBI receives the proper funding and resources to      investigate criminals who seek to steal from our government.       We also support the additional $30 million allocations      specified for both the Postal Inspection Service and the      Inspector General of the Department of Housing and Urban      Development (HUD-OIG), As the Postal Service confronts its      fiscal challenges, it is imperative that the Postal      Inspection Service is properly funded in order to carry out      its vital mission. If the Postal Service continues to tighten      the Postal Inspection Service belt, our Inspectors won't be      able to breathe, i.e. continue to conduct high impact      criminal institution crimes. They, too, need to be properly      funded so they can continue to investigate those who seek to      steal from our government.       Thank you, Senator Leahy, for recognizing the need to fund      those agencies who are dedicated to protecting our      government's capital. We also applaud your recognition of the      need to address the misguided interpretation of the money      laundering statute that was rendered in the Santos case.           Respectfully submitted,                                                         J. Adler,     National President.                                  ____                                           National Association of                            Assistant United States Attorneys,                                   Lake Ridge, VA, March 20, 2009.     Re Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, S. 386     Hon. Harry Reid,     Senate Majority Leader,     U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Senate Republican Leader,     U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Republican Leader McConnell:      On behalf of the National Association of Assistant United      States Attorneys, I write to urge the Senate to proceed      without delay to approve the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery      Act of 2009, S. 386. This legislation was reported by the      Senate Judiciary Committee on March 5. Our organization,      which represents the interests of the 5,400 Assistant United      States Attorneys responsible for enforcement of the nation's      laws and the pursuit of justice, strongly supports this      legislation and urges prompt Senate passage. The legislation      also has the support of the Department of Justice itself.       The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act (FERA) will make new      tools and resources available to prosecutors and law      enforcement authorities to investigate and prosecute the      corporate and mortgage frauds that have contributed to the      collapse of our economy and caused such widespread harm. The      legislation authorizes $230 million for hiring fraud      prosecutors and investigators at the Justice Department for      fiscal years 2010 and 2011. This includes $50 million for      U.S. Attorneys' offices to expand prosecutorial staffing of      its mortgage fraud strike forces and $40 million for the      criminal, civil, and tax divisions at the Justice Department      to provide special litigation and investigative support to      those efforts.       FERA also makes a number of important improvements to fraud      and money laundering statutes to strengthen the ability of      federal prosecutors to combat this growing wave of fraud.       This legislation, like the FIRREA legislation responding to      the savings and loan crisis, is the most significant effort      to reinvigorate our federal fraud enforcement program in more      than two decades. Congress should move quickly to pass this      legislation so American taxpayers can be confident that those      who are criminally responsible for contributing to the      present economic disaster, as well as those who may attempt      to exploit federal efforts to promote recovery, are      apprehended and held fully accountable fox their wrongs.           Sincerely yours,                                                  Richard Delonis,     President.                                  ____                                                    Association of                                    Certified Fraud Examiners,                                       Austin, TX, March 10, 2009.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Association of Certified Fraud      Examiners (ACFE) is the world's largest anti-fraud      organization and the premier provider of anti-fraud training      and education. Together with nearly 50,000 members, the ACFE      is reducing business fraud world-wide and inspiring public      confidence in the integrity and objectivity within the      profession. The mission of the ACFE is to reduce the      incidence of fraud and white-collar crime and to assist in      fraud detection and deterrence.       On behalf of the ACFE, I applaud you and the Senate      Judiciary Committee for your commitment to reduce fraud and      your diligence in creating S. 386, The Fraud Enforcement and      Recovery Act of 2009. This is an important piece of      legislation that will make a significant impact on reducing      the impact of Fraud and restoring public confidence in our      financial markets.       According to a Survey of Certified Fraud Examiners (CFEs)      who investigated cases between January 2006 and February      2008, U.S. organizations lose an estimated seven percent of      their annual revenues to fraud. When applied to the projected      2008 United States Gross National Product, the seven percent      figure translates to approximately $994 billion in fraud      losses. The ACFE published the     results of the survey in our 2008 Report to the Nation on      Occupational Fraud & Abuse       The ACFE administers the CFE credential. The CFE denotes      proven expertise in fraud prevention, detection and      deterrence. CFEs are trained to identify the warning signs      and red flags that indicate evidence of fraud and fraud risk.      CFEs around the world help protect the global economy by      uncovering fraud and implementing processes to prevent fraud      from occurring in the first place. As you stated in a recent      press release, the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009      was created to strengthen the Federal Government's capacity      to investigate, prosecute, and even deter financial frauds.      In order to be effective at these goals, it requires      practitioners who are trained with the necessary fraud      prevention, detection, and examination skills. The CFE      credential and the training and experience required of an      individual to become a CFE are critical skill sets that the      Federal Government should demand of its resources. We      encourage you to include CFE training and credentials as part      of any plan to help prevent and detect fraud.       With our compliments, enclosed is our Report to the Nation      as well as the current issue of Fraud Magazine. We hope these      publications provide greater insight into the valuable work      that both the ACFE and its members provide. The ACFE is proud      to have such an honorable colleague in the fight against      fraud and we are deeply appreciative of your exemplary work.       If there is anything I can offer or extend to you in the      future, please do not hesitate to ask.           Cordially,                                              Scott J. Grossfield,                                                              CEO.       Enclosures: Report to the Nation, Fraud Magazine.
