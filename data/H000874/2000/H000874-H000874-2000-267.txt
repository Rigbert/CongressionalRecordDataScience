Speaker, today I am introducing the Library of Congress Financial Management Act of 2000, bipartisan legislation which will authorize the Library to create a revolving fund which would allow a number of the Library's cost-recovery programs to operate more efficiently. This legislation, which the Library has sought for a number of years, would provide for more efficient and accountable financial management of fee-based Library programs and would correct longstanding deficiencies first identified by the General Accounting Office in 1991 and highlighted in subsequent independent audits.  The legislation has bipartisan, bicameral support. Our colleague Senator Cochran of Mississippi, who serves with me as a member of the Joint Committee of Congress on the Library, has introduced similar legislation in the Senate (S. 2286). It is especially appropriate for Congress to address these matters now, in the year of the Library's Bicentennial, as the Library retools itself to meet the needs of Congress and the American people in the new century.  The bill authorizes a financial restructuring of existing fee-based program operations. It authorizes no new fees, other than for specified activities relating to audio-visual preservation services associated with the Library's role as a national conservation center.  The bill would increase the efficiency of the Library's cost-recovery programs by establishing a systematic relationship between program costs and fees charged, setting program operations on a more business-like foundation. A 1996 Library of Congress management audit report stated that ``charging fees for services works best when the appropriate financial structures, such as revolving funds, are in place.'' The report also stated that a revolving fund mechanism allows managers to better control their resources, monitor their costs, and track performance, and most importantly, allow accumulation of reserves for slow periods and the development of strategic plans that address productivity objectives across fiscal years.  This legislation will increase the accountability of the Library's current self-sustaining programs by: providing proper statutory authority for retaining receipts, as GAO has often suggested; limiting obligations to amounts approved in annual appropriations bills; requiring annual independent audits of financial statements following government auditing standards; requiring annual submission of the audited financial statements to Congress; and establishing separate accounts for each fund service unit.  In the most recent audit report reviewing the Library's financial statements, the independent auditor again noted the Library's need for proper Congressional authority to operate gift revolving funds. This is now the sole remaining vulnerability identified by the auditor's examination of compliance with certain laws and regulations.  The bill will also transfer to the revolving fund certain cost-recovery programs currently authorized under the Economy Act. The major programs included are FedLink and Federal Research Division [FRD]; the services the Library of Congress is able to provide the federal sector through these programs are invaluable, and the Library is uniquely able to provide them because of its collections and its acquisitions expertise. The transfer of these programs to a revolving fund will eliminate significant costs currently incurred by annual shut-down and start-up imposed under that Act.  With the requested revolving fund authority, federal libraries participating in FedLink could save, in the aggregate, an estimated $1.37 million each year in increased efficiencies and improved vendor discounts. The paperwork burden of federal librarians, such as overly complex inter-agency agreements and year-end closeout, refund and re-registration chores required by the Economy Act, could also be significantly reduced. Revolving fund authority would, simply put, save costs and place both programs on a firmer business foundation.  The Financial Management Act also includes language to update the outdated 1902 law authorizing the sale of cataloging data tolibraries across the nation, by allowing the use of new technologies and enabling a more businesslike cost-recovery mechanism. In addition, it includes administrative changes to the Library of Congress Trust Fund Board to permit more efficient operation of the Board's decision-making functions.  The Library's Inspector General, in reviewing this legislation, strongly believes it will strengthen the internal controls and accountability of the Library's business-type operations, as well as clarify the legislative authority for the operation of these programs.  Mr. Speaker, a more detailed section-by-section description of the legislation follows:  The Library of Congress Financial Management Act of 2000 Section-by-                            Section Analysis                                summary       The Library of Congress Financial Management Act of 2000 is      intended to improve the Library of Congress's financial      management and administration and to maximize the use of its      resources. The bill encompasses three changes in the      Library's authorizing legislation: (1) it establishes a      revolving fund for the operation of most cost-recovery      services, as recommended by the General Accounting Office,      and Economy Act (inter-agency) activities; (2) it updates the      1902 authority provided in 2 U.S.C. 150 that allows the sale      of cataloging products and services to the nation's      libraries; and (3) it makes needed changes to enhance the      continuity of the Library's Trust Fund Board.              title i. library of congress revolving fund       The legislation establishes cost recovery for the direct      and indirect costs of information products and services,      through a Library of Congress Revolving Fund. This practice      embodies the principles of 31 U.S.C. 9701: ``It is the sense      of Congress that each service or thing of value provided by      an agency . . . to a person . . . is to be self-sustaining to      the extent possible.''       The Library currently provides a variety of these types of      services through various self-sustaining funds, the most      notable of which, the Photoduplication Service, has existed      since 1938. However, the General Accounting Office (GAO) in      its August 1991 report, First Audit of the Library of      Congress Discloses Significant Problems (as well as      subsequent reviews), recommended the Library seek      authorization of a separate revolving fund to handle these      types of activities. This legislation enables the Librarian      to implement that recommendation.       A fundamental reason to establish a revolving fund is to      provide for the systematic disclosure of the relationship      between program income and costs for products and services,      thereby providing a firm basis for decisions regarding      services to be undertaken and prices to be charged. Thus, the      revolving fund will improve accountability to the Congress,      as recommended by the GAO.     Section 101. Availability of fund service activities       This section authorizes the Librarian of Congress to: (1)      establish specific cost-recovery activities as Revolving Fund      service activities; and (2) establish Revolving Fund service      units to carry out activities supported by the revolving      fund's cost-recovery mechanism. These service units (an      organizational term already employed in the Library) may be      partially or fully sustained through the Revolving Fund      established under the Act.       The intent of this provision is to authorize, but not      require, fee service activities to operate under the      revolving fund on or after the effective date of this Act.      The Library anticipates restructuring the financial operation      of these activities as soon as is feasible, but it is      recognized that it may be necessary to transfer some      activities to the revolving fund in phases.     Section 102. Fund service activities authorized       This section lists the Fund service activities authorized      by this act that may be conducted by Fund service units.      These activities are limited to the following seven: (1)      preparation of research reports, translations, analytical      studies, and related services, for any entity of the Federal      government or the District of Columbia (but would not, for      example, cover such appropriated research activities as those      conducted for the Congress by the Congressional Research      Service); (2) centralized acquisition of publications and      library materials in any format; information, research, and      library support services; training in library and information      services; and related services for any entity of the Federal      government or the District of Columbia; (3) decimal      classification development; (4) gift shop and other      activities involving sale of items associated with Library      collections, exhibits, performances, or other events; (5)      location, copying, storage, preservation and delivery      services for library materials (not including domestic      interlibrary loans), and international interlibrary lending;      (6) special events and programs, performances, exhibits,      workshops, and training; and (7) cooperative acquisitions of      foreign publications and research materials and related      services on behalf of participating institutions.       For the most part, these activities describe programs the      Library conducts currently. Some examples of these current      activities are: a bibliography of citations to scientific      literature on the earth's cold regions, compiled for the      National Science Foundation; area studies handbooks prepared      for the Department of Defense; centralized and cost-effective      procurement of commercial database services for Federal      agencies through FedLink; sale of exhibition catalogs in the      gift shop, such as Rome Reborn: the Vatican Library &      Renaissance Culture, and African American Odyssey: A Quest      for Full Citizenship; development of the Dewey Decimal      classification tables, and the Library's Cooperative      Acquisitions Program, which will be folded into the newly      created fund under this legislation.       Charging fees under the authority set forth in item (e) for      retrieval and delivery of library materials will not infringe      on basic library services, but will allow the Library to, for      example, continue to make its film collections available for      loan by permitting recovery and retention of costs of making      a loan copy of the film from a master copy.       The intent of section 102 is to authorize a revolving fund      mechanism for current fee-based activities of the Library      which now operate under the Economy Act, or the Library's      extant gift fund authority, plus the following activities not      currently being done or for which fees are not currently      charged: (1) charging fees for attending films and other      performances; (2) charging fees for borrowing films; and (3)      charging fees for services relating to a national audio-     visual conservation center (preservation, copying,      transporting and storage of films and other audio-visual      materials).     Section 103. Establishment of the Library of Congress          revolving fund       Section 103 establishes the Library of Congress Revolving      Fund in the U.S. Treasury as a ``no year'' fund to carry out      Fund service activities; this means that money remains      available in the Fund until expended. This section also sets      forth the sources of the Fund capital, and specifies amounts      received for Fund activities that are to be credited to the      Fund.       This section also establishes various operational controls      and limitations on the fund, including: (1) specification of      the capital and credits to be deposited into the fund; (2)      limiting obligations under the fund to limits set under the      legislative branch appropriations act for any fiscal year;      (3) requiring annual audits of fund financial statements, to      be submitted to Congress; and (4) requiring separate fund      service unit activity accounts.       The intent of sub. (b)(2), authorizing funds from other      Library appropriations accounts to be temporarily transferred      to the Fund, is primarily for the purpose of initially      capitalizing activities previously conducted under section      1535 of Title 31, U.S. Code [the Economy Act]. This      subsection requires the fund to reimburse such a ``loan''      within the period for which the appropriation is available.      Subsection (b) also specifies other amounts to be deposited      into the fund.       Subsection (c) specifies amounts to be added to the fund as      credits to the service unit accounts.       The intent of sub. (d) is to ensure that, once the      Librarian determines the appropriate grouping of activities      into fund service units, the reimbursable portion of each      service unit will be self-sufficient, operated under a      separate account within the revolving fund.       Subsection (e) is standard language applying to self-     supporting programs, requiring the agency to designate excess      amounts in the fund as miscellaneous receipts and deposit      such funds in the Treasury.       Subsection (f) requires that a financial statement be      prepared annually, that the statement be audited, and that      the audit be submitted to Congress on an annual basis.     Section 104. Operation of revolving fund activities       Section 104 establishes parameters for the operation of the      Revolving Fund activities Subsection (a) authorizes the      Librarian to set fees to recover the costs of activities      authorized by sec. 102, and authorizes the Library to sell      products and services resulting from those activities. This      section limits the purchase prices to levels necessary to      recover the direct and indirect costs for each fund service      unit, over a reasonable period of time.       Subsection (b) provides express authority to require      participants (including federal participants) to provide      advance payments, where necessary to ensure that the fund is      sufficiently capitalized, and under other circumstances upon      agreement with participants.       Subsection (c) permits fund activities to engage in multi-     year contracts. This language parallels identical authority      currently afforded executive branch agencies and the General      Accounting Office under the Federal Property and      Administrative Services Act [41 U.S.C. 253l and 254c].     Section 105. Repeal       Section 105 repeals the current authorization for the      Cooperative Acquisitions Program revolving fund; that fund,      and the corresponding activities associated with it, are      incorporated into the new Library of Congress Revolving Fund      created under Title I of this bill.     Section 106. No effect on personnel       This section specifies that nothing in Title I of this Act      is intended to affect the terms and conditions of employment      of any employee of the Library of Congress who carries out      any Revolving Fund activity. The purpose of this section is      to avoid any unintended consequences of restructuring current     activities to operate under a new revolving fund.               title ii--cataloging products and services       In 1902, the Library of Congress was first authorized by      Congress to serve the Nation's libraries by producing and      distributing catalog cards. These cards establish and      describe the author, title, and physical characteristics of a      book and contain subject headings and a classification number      to enable researchers to locate books by author, title, or      topic.       Over the years, the Library of Congress has expanded its      catalog card service by producing and distributing additional      bibliographic and technical products and services. In      addition to the print format, the Library has utilized other      formats to make cataloging data available, e.g., magnetic      tapes and CD-ROMs, and has recovered the distributing costs      for providing these products.       As a result of this centralized cataloging activity, the      Nation's academic and public libraries save significantly on      costs they would incur if they had to create their own      cataloging records.       Title II modernizes the authority given in the 1902 law      under which the Library provides these bibliographic      information services and products; and makes funds available      until expended.     Section 201. Availability of cataloging products and services       In addition to authorizing the Librarian of Congress to      sell cataloging products and services, this section limits      the prices charged for such products and services to recovery      of the distribution costs associated with furnishing such      products and services, rather than the current ``cost plus 10      percent.'' This section also provides that all moneys      received through the distribution of such products and      services shall be deposited in the Treasury and credited to      the Library of Congress salaries and expenses appropriation,      to remain available until expended. This mechanism will      provide a more stable financial base for cataloging      distribution operations.       For the purposes of this title, ``cataloging products and      services'' is defined to mean those bibliographic products      and services, in any format now known or later developed,      that are used by libraries and library organizations,      including other Library-created databases, and related      technical publications.       The language ``over a reasonable period of time'' is      included to make the provision consistent with the revolving      fund language under s. 101. This language will assist the      Cataloging Distribution Service in bridging fiscal years if      some distribution costs are incurred over more than one      fiscal year, and recognizes that the sale price of cataloging      products must be established on a businesslike basis, i.e.      based on overall distribution costs, measured by the      estimated sales volume of cataloging products over the      estimated duration of sale of any given item.     Section 202. Repeal       This section repeals the obsolete 1902 law authorizing the      production and sale of cataloging cards and records, in light      of the new authority established under sec. 201.                 title iii--trust fund board amendments       Title III of the bill, amending the Library of Congress      Trust Fund Board Act, will ensure the Board's continuity      across members' terms as well as the Congressional calendar.      The Library of Congress Trust Fund Board was created by      Congress in 1925 and charged with the acceptance, deposit,      and administration of funds given or bequeathed to the Board      for the benefit of the Library. In 1992, the Board was      expanded from 5 to 13 members. Three are ex-officio (The      Librarian of Congress, the Secretary of the Treasury; and the      Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Library); the      remaining members, who serve five-year terms, consist of two      appointed by the President, and four each appointed by the      Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Majority      Leader of the Senate (both in consultation with the      respective minority leaders).     Section 301. Addition of congressional board member       Section 301 increases the size of the Board by the addition      of a new member--the Vice-Chairman of the Joint Committee on      the Library. The Committee's Chairman has been an ex-officio      member of the Trust Fund Board since the Board's creation in      1925. Because the Chairmanship and Vice-Chairmanship of the      Joint Committee on the Library alternate each Congress      between the Senate and the House of Representatives, this      provision is intended to enhance the continuity of the      Library's Congressional overseers in the activities of the      Trust Fund Board.     Section 302. Temporary extension of board member term       The bill authorizes the Board Chairman to extend      temporarily the term of an appointive board member whose      period of appointment has expired. Such an extension could      not exceed two years, and would expire immediately upon the      appointment of a successor. The Library is requesting this      provision on behalf of the Trust Fund Board, which approved      the request by resolution on September 24, 1998.       Vacancies on the Trust Fund Board have occurred due to the      expiration of the members' terms, resignations, deaths and      for other reasons. Due to the press of Executive and      Congressional business, these vacancies often cannot be      filled to ensure that the Board consists of a sufficient      number of members necessary to conduct business and carry out      its fiduciary responsibilities. In recent cases, this has      meant, for example, that funds given to the Board to benefit      the Library have not been able to be accepted and invested in      a timely manner, at the expense of valuable investment income      to the Library.     Section 303. Trust fund board quorum       Section 303 amends the Trust Fund Board Act to specify that      seven members of the 14-member Board constitute a quorum;      current law requires nine of 13 members to conduct business.      The Library is also requesting this provision on behalf of      the Trust Fund Board, which approved the request by      resolution on September 24, 1998.                          ____________________
