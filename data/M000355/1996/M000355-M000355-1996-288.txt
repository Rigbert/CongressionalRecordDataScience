 1611. A bill to establish the Kentucky National Wildlife Refuge, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.        the kentucky national wildlife refuge authorization act Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I introduce a bill to establish the Kentucky National Wildlife Refuge. The designation will give Kentucky something that 49 other States have enjoyed for a long time: its own national wildlife refuge. What this means to my State is new tourism opportunities and a pristine environmental preserve that will be part of our legacy to future generations.  Nearly 100 years ago, President Theodore Roosevelt established the National Wildlife Refuge System to protect our Nation's open lands, water, and wildlife for the future. It was one of the first Federal environmental programs in our history.  Today, the National Wildlife Refuge System is made up of 571 refuges in 49 States and U.S. Territories, totaling nearly 92 million acres of the Nation's best wildlife habitat. Until now, Kentucky has been the only State without its own independently managed refuge.  The legislation I am proposing will authorize the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to purchase up to 20,000 acres in western Kentucky located in the east fork of the Clarks River. This site, located near Benton, is the only major bottomland hardwood area remaining in western Kentucky.  Once established, the Kentucky National Wildlife Refuge will showcase a unique ecosystem, protecting wildlife and offering a variety of educational opportunities for the public. This refuge will also provide recreational activities, including bird-watching, hiking, hunting, and the fishing.  The refuge area is situated on an important migratory fly-way and breeding area for a variety of waterfowl. A large number of migratory birds including wood ducks, song birds, and the threatened bald eagle make their home here. The hardwood forests make an ideal habitat for numerous woodpeckers, hawks, and the eastern wild turkey. Other wildlife which would thrive in this area include deer, beavers, otters, and bobcats.  For visitors, the refuge is conveniently located near Paducah, Mayfield, Murray, and Benton, and is just 15 miles from Land Between the Lakes, which draws nearly 2 million visitors a year. This refuge is ideally suited to serve surrounding schools, recreational hikers, and hunters. The Clarks River will also appeal to those who enjoy canoeing and fishing as well.  In addition to the environmental and educational benefits, the designation of the Kentucky Wildlife Refuge will also provide a significant economic boost to the area. The creation of Kentucky's first refuge will help keep tourist dollars in the State. A perfect example of this is a trip, planned by the Louisville Zoo, to a National Wildlife Refuge in Tennessee. This trip is for Kentuckians who are interested in eagle-watching. By creating a Kentucky wildlife refuge, people who are interested in outdoor activities would have an opportunity here in Kentucky--something that nature lovers and the State would benefit from.  I have worked hard to ensure that my proposal is fair in protecting the rights of individual landowners, while preserving this important habitat. Contained in my bill is language to ensure that the acquisition of refuge lands will be from willing sellers, donations, or exchanges only.  I am sensitive to the property rights and concerns of local landowners; and for this reason I will closely follow the project to ensure that their rights are protected.  I have also worked closely with the Kentucky Farm Bureau to guarantee that the management of the refuge will not impact surrounding farmers or unduly restrict agricultural activities. I am confident that both agricultural interests and conservation interests can exist side-by-side in this region.  Finally, it is deeply gratifying to have such a broad array of support for my proposal, including State and local public officials, conservation groups, and sportsmen. I would like to commend Tom Bennett, commissioner of the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources, and his staff, for their efforts to establish consensus among the various groups. This refuge could never have been established without the strong support of people like Tom, as well as the cooperation we have received from the surrounding communities.  It has been 92 years since Teddy Roosevelt created the National Wildlife Refuge System. The time is long overdue for Kentucky to join that system at last.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a text of the bill be printed in the Record and a list of organizations and individuals who have endorsed the creation of the wildlife refuge also be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1611       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Kentucky National Wildlife      Refuge Authorization Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) the area known as the Clarks River Basin, consisting of      20,000 acres of bottomland hardwood and associated wetlands      along the Clarks River and the East Fork of the Clarks River      in Graves, Marshall, and McCracken Counties, Kentucky, is of      critical importance to a variety of migratory and resident      waterfowl, neotropical migratory birds, forest wildlife, and      riverine species, and a wide array of other species      associated with bottomland communities;       (2) the area is the only major, natural (unchannelized)      bottomland hardwood wetland ecosystem remaining in western      Kentucky and attracts wintering migratory waterfowl,      neotropical migratory birds, and an array of raptors;       (3) the area provides extraordinary recreational, research,      and educational opportunities for students, scientists,      birdwatchers, wildlife observers, hunters, anglers, hikers,      and nature photographers;       (4) the area is an internationally significant      environmental resource that is unprotected and requires      active management to prevent vegetative encroachment and to      otherwise protect and enhance the value of the area as fish      and wildlife habitat;       (5) the Clarks River Basin has been identified in the      preliminary project proposal plan for the establishment of      the Kentucky National Wildlife Refuge, prepared by the United      States Fish and Wildlife Service (Southeast Region), as an      area deserving permanent protection; and       (6) since agriculture and silviculture are essential to the      economies of Graves, Marshall, and McCracken Counties and can      contribute to healthy ecosystems for wildlife, the refuge      should not restrict agricultural and silvicultural activities      on private lands.     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.       The purpose of this Act is to establish the Kentucky      National Wildlife Refuge to be managed--       (1) to conserve fish and wildlife populations and the      habitats of the populations, including habitats of bald      eagles, golden eagles, Indiana bats, wood ducks, neotropical      migratory birds, shorebirds, and other migratory birds;       (2) to preserve and showcase the concepts of biodiversity      and ecosystem management;       (3) to enhance and provide a vital link to public areas      containing habitat managed for waterfowl and other migratory      birds;       (4) to fulfill international treaty obligations of the      United States with regard to fish and wildlife and the      habitats of the fish and wildlife;       (5) to restore and maintain the physical and biological      integrity of wetlands and other waters within the refuge;       (6) to conserve species known to be threatened with      extinction; and       (7) to provide opportunities for scientific research,      environmental education, and fish- and wildlife-associated      recreation (including hunting, trapping, and fishing) and      access to the extent compatible with the management purposes      specified in paragraphs (1) through (6).
