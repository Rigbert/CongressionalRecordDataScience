 President, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for raising this important issue. He is correct that I have been working with the physician community, as well as the U.S. House of Representatives, to obtain a fuller understanding regarding the adequacy of the current physician formula under Medicare. We have learned that Medicare's current payment formula for physicians is problematic, and I agree that this issue should be addressed. We will continue our discussion, and objectively evaluate proposals that will update the payment formula for physicians.
