 I think what we have found is that rarely do we visit this rather obscure area of the law, the Vacancies Act. I am hoping in this visitation on one side, that we have some balance and impose requirements on the Senate to act in a timely fashion, as we impose a requirement on the executive branch to report a nominee in a timely fashion. But I also hope the time periods that we choose are realistic. I think anyone involved in this process at any level understands that when a person's name comes up in nomination, they are subjected to far greater scrutiny than ever before. It discourages many good people from even trying public service, and I am sure that many have been disappointed.  But let us, I hope, during the process of this debate, be sensitive to this reality. And it is a reality that, under the bill, the meter keeps on ticking even when this scrutiny is underway, even if it is interrupted and a new nominee is proposed for a post. And if, in fact, at 150 days the nomination is not forthcoming, then, as I understand this bill, we would preclude the President from filling the spot with an acting person. That, to me, is a sort of decision which on its face makes sense but may have some practical ramifications. It may affect the ability of the administration to choose the person most able to handle a matter that involves public health, public safety, or the national defense. I also think that this bill too narrowly restricts who can function in an acting capacity.
