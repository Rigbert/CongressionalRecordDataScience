 President, I came to the floor this afternoon to speak about the amendment offered by Senator Harkin, and I will do so in just a minute. But first I want to congratulate Senator Byrd for his tremendous work on education and thank him for his extremely strong voice in this area.  I know many students are starting school this week. Many young people are just starting out in kindergarten across the country this year. They will be grateful for Senator Byrd and his strong support of education. But so will the many students who have traveled to school while he has been here in the Senate advocating for them. I thank him for his work on their behalf over the many years. For all the young people out there who benefited from his wisdom and support but also, very importantly, for the teachers who will benefit as well, I thank my colleague from West Virginia.
