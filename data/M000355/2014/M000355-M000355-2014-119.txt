 President, I rise today to pay tribute to my personal friend, Mr. Jim Host. Jim is a native of Ashland, KY, and has spent his life dedicated to business and public service within our home State. The National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame recently announced that he will receive their award for Outstanding Contributor to Amateur Football--an honor that he is unquestionably deserving of and will add to his already extensive list of awards and accolades.  A standout high school baseball player, Mr. Host passed on a $25,000 offer to play professionally and instead accepted a scholarship to play at the University of Kentucky. Host would eventually play professional baseball, though only after he received his degree. As his career progressed, his time as a student athlete would never be too far from his thoughts.  In 1969, Host entered the world of politics, becoming the youngest member of Governor Louie B. Nunn's cabinet at the age of 29. Two years later, he was the Republican nominee for Lieutenant Governor, though he lost in the general election. Never one to be deterred by defeat, he focused his attention squarely on a new venture--starting his own business.  Mr. Host had only $107 to his name when, in 1972, he started Jim Host and Associates in a small office above a barber shop in downtown Lexington. What he lacked in monetary assets, however, he made up for with an impressive arsenal of smarts and determination. With these tools he built Host Communications, and forever altered the landscape of college athletics.  The foundation of Host Communications was the right to broadcast Kentucky basketball games over the radio. In its early years, Jim Host's company was one of several entities that had this right. However, Host soon obtained the exclusive rights and expanded his broadcast to 117 radio stations in the State. In addition to his radio broadcast, Host bought a publishing company and printed programs for Kentucky basketball and football games.  He continued to grow his business around Kentucky athletics, and over time he created the first model of the consolidated multimedia rights companies we see today. By the time he sold Host Communications to IMG in 2007, Host provided the University of Kentucky, and over 20 other college athletic programs, with what he called the ``full-meal-deal''--that is to say that TV deals, radio broadcasts, coaches' shows and their endorsements, publishing, signage, and sponsorship were all controlled by Host, and enabled the university to generate more revenue than was ever thought to be possible. Today, nearly every university with an athletics program follows this blueprint prepared by Jim Host.  Host also developed a close partnership with the NCAA and is credited with creating the organization's first corporate sponsorship program.  Now, at age 76, Jim hasn't slowed down at all. He still gets up at 4 a.m. every morning and is always quick to state that he ``can't sleep fast enough.''  As chairman of the Louisville Arena Authority, he was instrumental in the construction of the KFC Yum! Center as well as the subsequent surge of new business activity in the downtown area. Additionally, he currently serves as chairman of Volar Video.  By way of his grit, determination, and sheer smarts, Jim Host has seen immense success in his business and has effected an immeasurable impact on the Commonwealth of Kentucky and college athletics. I ask that my U.S. Senate colleagues join me in recognizing Jim Host and congratulating him for his latest award from the National Football Foundation.  The Lexington Herald-Leader recently published an article detailing Jim Host's latest award. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, June 12, 2014] Lexington Businessman Jim Host Honored by National Football Foundation       The National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame      has announced that sports marketing pioneer Jim Host of      Lexington has been named the recipient of its award for      Outstanding Contribution to Amateur Football.       ``Jim Host created a lasting legacy as a sports marketing      innovator, and his creative genius will continue for many      years as the bedrock of multimedia rights in college      athletics,'' the group's president and CEO, Steve Hatchell,      said in a news release. ``From humble beginnings, Jim built      Host Communications, essentially launching the practice of      marketing in college athletics. His efforts have resulted in      millions of dollars for colleges and universities nationwide,      and those numbers only continue to grow.''       First presented in 1974, the Outstanding Contribution to      Amateur Football Award provides national recognition to those      whose efforts to support the National Football Foundation      have been local in nature.       Host becomes the 38th recipient of the award.       Born in Ashland, Host received a baseball scholarship to      the University of Kentucky. After running for lieutenant      governor in 1971, he opened Jim Host and Associates, a one-     man operation above a barbershop in Lexington.       Host is chairman of Volar Video, which delivers customized      video across television, computer and mobile platforms. Volar      produced the live webcasts of both the National Football      Foundation's 56th annual awards dinner and the group's      announcement of the 2014 College Football Hall of Fame class.       Host will be honored at a dinner on Dec. 9 in New York.                          ____________________
