This organization's ``Shelter, Support, and Skills Training for Afghan Refugee and Displaced Widows and Orphans'' Program is an integrated plan that addresses the special needs of widows and their children, many of whom are refugees and internally displaced persons. The program provides shelter, access to clean water,psychosocial support and skills training to enable widows to gain the personal dignity of self-sufficiency.  I would also point out that village leaders have agreed to cooperate with World Compassion on this project. World Compassion has a long, successful track record of working with Afghanis in other programs to provide for their basic needs, and it is my hope that the State Department will help them continue to do so.  Mr. McCONNELL. I appreciate my friend taking the time to highlight the activities of World Compassion and hope that the State Department acts on the recommendations from the House report.                          ____________________[Pages S1927-S1928]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                   FOREIGN OPERATIONS APPROPRIATIONS                            WORLD COMPASSION
