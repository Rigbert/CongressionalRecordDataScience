Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 2 p.m. on Monday, February 21, 2005, unless it sooner has received a message from the Senate transmitting its concurrence in House Concurrent Resolution 66, in which case the House shall stand adjourned pursuant to that concurrent resolution.
