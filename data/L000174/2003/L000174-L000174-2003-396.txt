President, this has begun because the President renominated a divisive and controversial activist to another circuit court. That is regrettable. The Republican leadership in the Senate is forcing a confrontation at this time that is neither necessary nor constructive. I am sorry the White House has chosen to make these matters into partisan political fights rather than to work with Senate Democrats to fill judicial vacancies with qualified consensus nominees. There are thousands of qualified Republicans who would be endorsed by both Republicans and Democrats in this Senate. That would allow the American people to say we are not politicizing the courts. There would be a sigh of relief.  But we do not see that. We have a historic low level of cooperation from the White House. In fact, in the 29 years I have been here, through both Republican and Democratic administrations, I have never seen such a low level of cooperation.  Notwithstanding that, we have already confirmed 140 of President Bush's judicial nominees, including some of the most divisive and controversial sent by any President, Republican or Democrat. In fact, this year the Senate debated and voted on the nominations of three circuit court nominees who received far more than 40 negative votes.  If it were simply a case of filibustering judges, they would not have been confirmed. For example, Jeffrey Sutton's nomination to the Sixth Circuit received the fewest number of favorable votes of any confirmation in almost 20 years. He got only 52 votes.  When you have somebody who gets through the Senate with only 52 votes, you have to ask what kind of a signal that sends to the people of that circuit. Does it send a signal to the people of that circuit that we sent somebodythere who is representing all the people within that circuit, Republicans, Democrats, independents? Or are we sending somebody who is intended to be a partisan ideologue representing only one party on a court that is supposed to be independent of party politics?  In fact, the administration is seeking to force through the confirmation process more and more extreme nominees in its effort to pack the courts and tilt them sharply in a narrow ideological direction. Instead of uniting the American people, too many of this administration's nominations divide the American people and divide the Senate. How much greater service could be done to the country and to the courts if the President sought to unite us and not divide us?  In fact, the unprecedented level of assertiveness by the administration has led to more and more confrontation with the Senate. As Republicans in the Senate abandon any effort to provide a check or balance in the process, it falls to Senate Democrats to seek to protect the independence of the Federal courts and the rights of all Americans.  Our Democratic leadership in the Senate worked hard earlier this year to correct some of the problems that arose from some of the earlier actions of the Judiciary Committee. But, once again, just last week, Republican members of the Judiciary Committee decided to override the rights of the minority and violate longstanding committee precedent and actually violated--imagine this, the Judiciary Committee violating its own rules, the Judiciary Committee of all committees, the committee that should set the standards for everybody else--violated these rules and precedents in order to rush to judgment even more quickly this President's most controversial nominees.  It was a sad day in committee, but it was a devastating day in the Senate. Yet my friends on the other side of the aisle persist in their obstinate and single-minded crusade to pack the Federal bench with right-wing ideologues, regardless of what rules, what longstanding practices, what personal assurances, what relationships, or what Senators' words are broken or ruined in the process.  Republican partisans fail to recognize that Democrats worked diligently and fairly to consider President Bush's nominees, including nominees to the same court as that to which Justice Owen has been nominated. Two months ago, on May 1, the Senate confirmed Judge Edward Prado to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Senate Democrats cleared the nomination of Judge Edward Prado to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit without delay.  The irony is, we cleared Judge Prado immediately, but he was held up by one anonymous hold--and it came from the Republican side. At the same time the White House is excoriating Democrats for holding up their nominees, we had a nominee of President Bush to the Fifth Circuit and for a month, while we are trying to have him confirmed, he is being held up by an anonymous hold, not even a hold somebody is willing to state for the record but an anonymous hold on the Republican side. Talk about rope-a-dope--if we clear the nominees, they hold them up and we get the blame. Interesting.  All Democratic Senators serving on the Judiciary Committee voted to report his nomination favorably. All Democratic Senators indicated they were prepared to proceed with the nomination. When Republicans finally lifted their hold on Judge Prado, he was confirmed unanimously.  When Democrats assumed Senate leadership in the summer of 2001, there had not been a Fifth Circuit nominee confirmed for 7 years. There had been a lot of nominees, but they were blocked by the Republicans. Indeed, Republicans blocked consideration of three qualified nominees to the Fifth Circuit in the years 1995 to 2001, along with 60 other judicial nominees of President Clinton.  In 2001, Democrats worked hard on the nomination of Judge Edith Brown Clement, a conservative judge nominated by President Bush, and with the efforts of Democrats she was confirmed. Thus, unlike the years 1995 to 2001 when Republicans were preventing action on every single one of President Clinton's nominees to the Fifth Circuit, Democrats have already cooperated in the confirmation of two of President Bush's nominees to that circuit, including one while we were in the majority.  In spite of the treatment by the Republicans of so many moderate nominees in the previous administration, we proceeded last July to the hearing on Justice Owen and we proceed to debate and vote on all three of President Bush's Fifth Circuit nominees, despite the treatment of President Clinton's nominees by the Republican majority.  The nomination of Priscilla Owen was rejected by the Senate Judiciary Committee. She was rejected as a judicial activist with extreme views. That is where it should have ended. Never, ever in our Nation's history has a President renominated somebody to the same judicial vacancy after rejection by the Judiciary Committee--never. In this case, of course, they did, to create a political point.  We tried very hard to work with the administration to fill judicial vacancies, in great contrast to the fate of many of President Clinton's nominees from Texas who were blocked and delayed by Republicans, including Enrique Moreno, nominated to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, who never got a hearing or a vote; Judge Jorge Rangel, nominated to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, who never got a hearing and never got a vote; and Judge Hilda Tagle, whose nomination was delayed nearly 2 years for no good reason.  All we are saying is let's have judges who are there for all the people. It is one thing for Republicans to control the White House. The President was inaugurated. He has that right. Republicans control both Houses. But the courts are supposed to be nonpartisan.  We have worked hard to try to balance the need to have enough judges to handle cases with the imperative that they be fair judges for all people, poor or rich, Republican or Democrat, of any race or religion. This has been especially difficult because a number of this President's judicial nominees have records that do not demonstrate that they will be fair and impartial.  The White House's allies have bombarded us with all sorts of misleading information to try to bully us into rolling over and rubber-stamping these nominees. They are playing politics with the judicial branch and using it for partisan political purposes. That is most regrettable. Their charges of prejudice are simply appalling and should be rejected by all Americans as the crass and base partisan politics that they are.  The plain fact is that this Senate has confirmed more judges at a faster pace than in any of the past six and one half years under Republican control with a Democratic President. With Democrat cooperation, this Senate has doubled the number of judicial confirmations and more than doubled the number of circuit court confirmations of President Bush's nominees compared to how the Republican-controlled Senate treated President Clinton's. The Senate has confirmed 40 judges already this year. That exceeds the number of judges during all of 2000, 1999, and 1997, and is more than twice as many judges as were confirmed during the entire 1996 session. It is more than the average annual confirmations for the 6\1/2\ years the Republican majority controlled the pace of confirmations from 1995 through the first half of 2001. Thus, in the first 7 months of this year, we have already exceeded the year totals for 4 of the 6 years the Republican majority controlled the pace of President Clinton's judicial nominees and the Republican majority's yearly average. One hundred and forty lifetime confirmations in 2 years is better than in any 3-year period from 1995 though 2000, when a Republican majority controlled the fate of President Clinton's judicial nominations.  We have already this year confirmed 10 judges to the Courts of Appeals. This is more than were confirmed in all of 4 of the past 6 years when the Republicans were in the majority--in 1996, 1997, 1999, and 2000. And in the 2 other years, the 10th circuit nominee was not confirmed until much later in the year. We have now confirmed 27 circuit court judges nominated by President Bush. This is more circuit court judges confirmed at this point in his presidency than for his father, President Clinton, or President Reagan at the same point. We have made tremendous progress andI want to thank, in particular, the Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee for their hard work in this regard. These achievements have not been easy. The Senate is making some progress. More has been achieved than Republicans are willing to acknowledge.  So, as we repeat our vote on this nomination today and Republicans continue their drumbeat of unfair political recriminations, we should all acknowledge how far we have come from the 110 vacancies that Democrats inherited from the Republican majority in the summer of 2001. In addition to more confirmations and fewer vacancies, we have more Federal judges serving than ever before.  Under a Republican majority, circuit vacancies more than doubled and overall vacancies increased dramatically. Despite the fact that close to 90 additional vacancies have arisen since the summer of 2001, we have worked hard and cut those vacancies from 110 to less than 60. Earlier this year, until new judgeships were authorized, the vacancy rate on the Federal courts was at the lowest number in 13 years. Even with the 15 new judgeships effective this month, the vacancy rate is now well-below where Senator Hatch inherited it, and well-below the rate Senator Hatch called ``full-employment.'' There are more full-time Federal judges on the bench today than at any time in U.S. history, in the last 214 years. And, if you add in the senior judges, there are more than 1,000 Federal judges sitting on the Federal courts.  With a modicum of cooperation from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue and the other side of the aisle we could achieve so much more. As it is, we have worked hard to repair the damage to the confirmation process and achieved significant results. Republicans seem intent on inflicting more damage, to the process, to the Senate, and to the independence of the Federal courts.  Unfortunately, the nomination of Justice Owen is a nomination that should never have been remade. It was rejected by the Judiciary Committee last year after a fair hearing and extensive and thoughtful substantive consideration. The White House would rather play politics with judicial nominations than solve problems. This unprecedented renomination of a person voted down by the Senate Judiciary Committee is proof of that. That Senate Republicans are continuing to press this matter knowing the outcome of this vote shows what a charade this has become.  This nomination is extreme. This nominee has shown herself to be a judicial activist and an extremist even on the very conservative Texas Supreme Court where her conservative colleagues have criticized her judging as activist again and again.  The nomination process starts with the President. It is high time for the White House to stop the partisanship and campaign rhetoric and work with us to ensure the independence and impartiality of the Federal judiciary so that the American people, all of the American people, can go into every Federal courtroom across the country and know that they will receive a fair hearing and justice under the law. It is time for Senate Republicans to stand up for the Senate's role as a check on the unfettered power of the President to pack the courts and for fairness.
