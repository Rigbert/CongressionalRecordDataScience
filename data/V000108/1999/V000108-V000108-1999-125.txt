Speaker, today I am proud to introduce a measure which I have supported since the 103rd Congress. This bill, the Clean Water Trust Fund Act, would put all funds collected through Clean Water Act fines and penalties into a trust fund to be used specifically for cleaning up polluted waters. This common sense measure links environmental penalties with environmental remedies, and ensures that money collected for environmental violations will not be lost in Washington.  In Northwest Indiana, one of the most unique and naturally beautiful coastlines in the world has been the site of a major industrial center for over a century. With the advent of environmental regulation in the last fifty years, the companies which had before polluted the waters with impunity had to reform their manufacturing processes and begin paying fines and penalties if their new procedures did not decrease their pollution emissions to an acceptable level. The residents of my hometown were comforted by the understanding that these new rules would protect our environment--our coastline and groundwater and potable water supply--and keep us from being poisoned by the very industries on which we relied for work. But it just has not worked the way it should. Instead of working together, the hand that fines and the hand that cleans are attached to different bodies. Money collected for polluting drinking water can be used for anything from mohair subsidies to McDonalds' overseas advertising. This is clearly not the heroic role of environmental regulation envisioned by my friends and neighbors when we first supported the Environmental Protection Agency's control over how much and what an industry could dump into our nation's waters.  My bill would begin to repair this disconnect. Under the Clean Water Trust Fund Act, residents of Northwest Indiana who read about millions being paid by a local company in Clean Water Act fines will know that money will come back to the region and be used to repair the environmental damage. It is as simple as that. The measure instructs the EPA Administrator to work with the states and turn the funds collected in fines and penalties into environmental remediation for the areas affected.  We can have no higher priority than creating a society where our citizens have the opportunity to live safely and healthily. Making sure that everyone has access to safe, clean water is one of the most basic requirements of civilization. This measure, which would reconnect penalties to relief, is an important first step. Mr. Speaker, with the support of over thirty of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, I am pleased to introduce the Clean Water Trust Fund Act.                          ____________________
