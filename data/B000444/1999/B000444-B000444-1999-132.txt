 President, I find the leader's comment extremely fascinating. I want to set the record straight on a couple of minor details, as they are.  No. 1: The letter we sent was on July 20. The opening paragraph said:       We urge you to hold hearings on the Comprehensive Nuclear      Test-Ban Treaty and report it to the full Senate for debate.      Most importantly, we ask this be done in sufficient time to      allow the United States to actively participate in the      treaty's inaugural conference of ratifying states to be held      in early September.  We wrote that in July. The assumption, anyone in good faith would assume, was we have hearings now--July, August, and September. We had none. We did not have any. Zip. None.  The majority leader said, ``Hearings are underway now.'' That is his quote. They are not underway now. The day before the treaty, the Foreign Relations Committee held its first hearing, on the day after we are discharged of responsibility. With all due respect to my friend from the great State of Virginia, chairman of the powerful Armed Services Committee, the only committee of jurisdiction under the rules is the Foreign Relations Committee. Their input is important. We love to hear their opinion, as we do the Intelligence Committee. They have no jurisdiction. It gets sent to our committee, not to theirs. And we have 1 day of hearings after we are discharged? Give me a break.
