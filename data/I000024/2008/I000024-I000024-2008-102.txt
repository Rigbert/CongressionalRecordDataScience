President, let me first thank the Senator from Texas for allowing me to very briefly work in here.  It happens that I was elected to the House and then to the Senate at the same time as Craig and Susan Thomas. And you know, sometimes you see someone for the first time and they have, as Senator Enzi pointed out, that infectious smile, and that was Craig. That was Craig. Everyone had to love Craig.  I have thought of him so often during consideration of the bill that is on the floor now. Craig had such convictions, but he never quit smiling. What the guy could do is, he could say the same thing I would say and people would love him, but they wouldn't love me. I don't know how he got by with that, but he did.  I picture him and where he would be today if he were here while we have a bill on the floor that has an increase in gas taxes, $6.7 trillion of increases in taxes over the life of the bill, with job losses to China, and he wouldn't be sitting there, he would be up here. I applaud his replacement, the junior Senator from Wyoming, Senator Barrasso. Every time I turn around, he is coming down and saying exactly--exactly--what Craig would be saying.  I would say this about Craig Thomas: He was always there at our Senate prayer breakfast every Wednesday morning. He was a Jesus guy, like we are, and so I don't feel the sadness a lot of people do with Craig Thomas, because I can only say right now: Craig, I know you are here with us, and we are going to see you later.  I thank my colleague, and I yield the floor.
