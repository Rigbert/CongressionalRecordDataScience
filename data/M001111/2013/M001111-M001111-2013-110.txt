 I want to be very clear--that work is continuing. The majority leader has made clear that we are going to keep working on amendmentson that bill, so everybody should be prepared for more votes.  I urge all of my colleagues to continue talking to me and to Senator Collins, and we will keep working to get as many amendments as possible.  Many of you have approached us already with your plans and thoughts. I urge the rest of you not to wait until the last minute. Senator Collins and I are working with the floor staff to line up votes.  I know everyone is anxious to have the August recess occur. We are as well. The sooner we can get the amendments and get this bill completed, the sooner all of us will be able to accomplish that.  I know a number of our colleagues on the floor have noted that this has been an open process. That is what Senator Collins and I set out to do, and we are going to make sure that continues.  This is a bipartisan bill. I will remind all of us that it got 6 Republican votes in committee and 73 votes to proceed to the open debate we have had this past week. That debate, again, is going to continue. I am hopeful we can move to a bipartisan finish on a good bill that reflects great ideas from both sides of the aisle.  I again want to thank Senator Collins for her work on this, and we are ready to move forward.  I yield the floor to her at this time.
