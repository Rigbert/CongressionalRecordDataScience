President, I want to speak today about the provisions in H.R. 4365--which passed the Senate on Friday, that address our Nation's growing problems with methamphetamines and ecstasy and other club drugs. I am happy to have worked with Senator Harkin and Senator Biden to ensure that these provisions could be included in the conference report. Indeed, Senator Harkin has worked tirelessly to address this issue, and I commend him for his efforts; without his involvement, this legislation would not have passed.  I believe that the methamphetamine provisions in this report embody the best elements of S. 486, which the Senate passed last year, while casting aside the more ill-advised ideas in that legislation. The manufacture and distribution of methamphetamines and amphetamines is an increasingly serious problem, and the provisions we have retained in this legislation will provide significant additional resources for both law enforcement and treatment. In addition to creating tougher penalties for those who manufacture and distribute illicit drugs, this bill allocates additional funding to assist local law enforcement, allows for the hiring of new DEA agents, and increases research, training and prevention efforts. This is a good and comprehensive approach to deal with methamphetamines in our local communities.  Meanwhile, we have not included in this legislation the provision in S. 486 that would have allowed law enforcement to conduct physical searches and seizures without the existing notice requirement, a serious curtailment of the civil liberties that Americans have come to expect. It would have also amended the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure so that Rule 41(d)'s requirements concerning the notice, inventory, and return of seized property would only apply to tangible property, thus exempting the contents of individuals' computers from the property protections provided to American citizens under current law. I worked hard to make sure that that provision did not become law, and I had effective and dedicated allies on both sides of the aisle in the House of Representatives. Indeed, the methamphetamine legislation approved by the House Judiciary Committee did not include this provision.  We have also not included those provisions from S. 486 that concerned advertising and the distribution of information about methamphetamines. Both of those provisions raised First Amendment concerns, and I believe the legislation is stronger without them. Once again, the House Judiciary Committee acted wisely, leaving those provisions out of its meth legislation.  The meth bill has taken a lengthy path from introduction to passage, and I believe it has been improved at each step. For example, we significantly improved this bill during committee considerations. As the comprehensive substitute for the original bill was being drafted, I had three primary reservations: First, earlier versions of the bill imposed numerous mandatory minimums. I continue to believe that mandatory minimums are generally an inappropriate tool in our critically important national fight against drugs. Simply imposing or increasing mandatory minimums subverts the more considered process Congress set up in the Sentencing Commission. The Federal Sentencing Guidelines already provide a comprehensive mechanism to equalize sentences among persons convicted of the same or similar crime, while allowing judges the discretion they need to give appropriate weight to individual circumstances.  The Sentencing Commission goes through an extraordinary process to set sentence levels. For example, pursuant to our 1996 anti-methamphetamine law, the Sentencing Commission increased meth penalties after careful analysis of recent sentencing data, a study of the offenses, and information from the DEA on trafficking levels, dosage unit size, price and drug quantity. Increasing mandatory minimums takes sentencing discretion away from judges. We closely examine judges' backgrounds before they are confirmed and should let them do their jobs.  Mandatory minimums also impose significant economic and social costs. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the annual cost of housing a federal inmate ranges from $16,745 per year for minimum security inmates to $23,286 per year for inmates in high security facilities. It is critical that we take steps that will effectively deter crime, but we should not ignore the costs of the one size fits all approach of mandatory minimums. We also cannot ignore the policy implications of the boom in our prison population. In 1970, the total population in the federal prison system was 20,686 prisoners, ofwhom 16.3 percent were drug offenders. By 1997, the federal prison population had grown to almost 91,000 sentenced prisoners, approximately 60 percent of whom were sentenced for drug offenses. The cost of supporting this expanded federal criminal justice system is staggering. We ignore at our peril the findings of RAND's comprehensive 1997 report on mandatory minimum drug sentences: ``Mandatory minimums are not justifiable on the basis of cost-effectiveness at reducing cocaine consumption, cocaine expenditures, or drug-related crime.''  This is why I have repeatedly expressed my concerns about creating new mandatory minimum penalties, including in the last Congress, when another anti-methamphetamine bill was before the Judiciary Committee.  Second, earlier drafts of this bill would have contravened the Supreme Court's 1999 decision in Richardson versus U.S. I, along with some other members of the Committee, believed that it would be inappropriate to take such a step without first holding a hearing and giving thorough consideration to such a change in the law. The Chairman of the Committee, Senator Hatch, was sensitive to this concern and he agreed to remove that provision from this legislation.  Third, an earlier version of the bill contained a provision that would have created a rebuttable presumption that may have violated the Constitution's Due Process Clause. Again, I believed that we needed to seriously consider and debate such a provision before voting on it. And again, the Chairman was sensitive to the concerns of some of us on the Committee and agreed to remove that provision.  The SAMHSA authorization bill also dealt with ecstasy and other so-called ``club drugs.'' Ecstasy is steadily growing in popularity, especially among younger Americans. It is perceived by many young people as being harmless, but medical studies are beginning to show that it can have serious long-term effects on users. This bill asks the Sentencing Commission to look at our current sentencing guidelines for those who manufacture, import, export, or traffic ecstasy, and to provide for increased penalties as it finds appropriate. It also authorizes $10 million for prevention efforts. These efforts are particularly crucial with new drugs like ecstasy, so that our young people can learn the true consequences of use.  This legislation took a tough approach to drugs without taking the easy way out of mandatory minimums, and without undue Congressional interference with the Sentencing Commission. I hope that any future efforts we must take to address our drug problem will use these provisions as a model.                          ____________________
