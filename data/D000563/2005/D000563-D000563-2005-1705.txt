I do not know what it takes to finally get this Senate to go on record and stand by the Senate position in conference. Twice now we have taken this proposal to conference and it has disappeared, with the White House or Department of Defense or somebody opposing it. If we have a record vote, I think we have a much better chance to say to the conferees, for goodness sakes, the third time, let us stand up for these men and women.I am sorry; I want to insist on the yeas and nays. I believe that is the only way to make it clear where we stand on the issue and to convince the conferees to finally stand for the Senate position if it succeeds.
