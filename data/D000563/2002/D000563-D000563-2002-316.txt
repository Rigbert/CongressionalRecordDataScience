Our average student loan, as consolidated under this program, is $30,000. What the Senator from Massachusetts tells us is that President Bush's administration has suggested adding $10,000 in cost to pay back that student loan.  So one might say to themselves, this must be some national emergency that would lead us to the point where we would take a young college graduate and say we are going to eliminate a program and heap on another $10,000 in debt for them to pay off. The national emergency appears to be making permanent the President's tax cut program.  We did a little analysis on this program recently, and I think the Senator from Massachusetts is aware that 65 percent of President Bush's tax cut goes to people making over $500,000 a year. So think about this for a second. The new college graduate coming out with a debt, in my State, of an average $29,000, just got a $10,000 bill to collect money, to do what? To give to the average person making over $500,000 a year a $39,000-a-year tax break.  What is wrong with this picture? Why are we not helping the young men and women who are going to lead this Nation with their education to take the kind of jobs that they need?  I know the Senators from Maryland and Massachusetts know the situation where so many young graduates want to go into teaching, for example, and they look at their student loans and say: This is impossible. I cannot make enough money as a teacher.  The Bush administration proposal would make their debt larger. For what? To give a tax break, two-thirds of which goes to people making over $500,000 a year. This is totally upside down.  The student loan obligations for students across America have doubled within the last 8 years. They are likely to go up in the future. The Bush administration proposal, I am afraid, is going to make it even more difficult for our sons and daughters and grandsons and granddaughters to pursue a higher education.
