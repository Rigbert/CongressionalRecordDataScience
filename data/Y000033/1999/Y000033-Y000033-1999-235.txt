Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing legislation to correct one of the oldest and most controversial mistakes ever made in the naming of one of America's foremost natural geologic features, which is in the State of Alaska. I refer to Denali, which the federal government persistently and unjustly names Mount McKinley.  Denali is North America's tallest mountain, rising to 20,320 feet in the heart of the Alaska Range. Its vertical rise measured from its lowlands to the summit is greater than that of Mt. Everest, in effect making it the tallest mountain in the world. Denali is also one of the nation's most beautiful natural features and a fitting symbol of the largest state and most prolific and responsible developer of natural resources. Alaskans and visitors alike marvel at its stunning beauty and dominant presence on the landscape, and the massif has come to represent both Alaska's proud heritage and bright future.  On a clear day, one can see the giant peak looming on the horizon 140 miles away to the south in Alaska's largest city of Anchorage. It is no wonder that Athabascan Native people have always called the peak ``Denali,'' which means the High One.  Through the State's history the peak has been known as ``Denali'' until it was discovered by a prospector who took it upon himself to name the mountain after President William McKinley. Rather than call the mountain what the Alaskan people had called it for hundreds if not thousands of years, one person arbitrarily changed the face of maps everywhere . . .  everywhere except Alaska, that is.  In 1975 the Alaska Legislature formally named it Denali, and the mountain is known by that name within Alaska to this day. Differences between state and federal names of geographic features are rare, and in this care the anomaly deserves amending.  To this end, the State approached the federal Board of Geographic Names with the proposal to require the use of Denali in all maps nationwide; the Board was prepared to act favorably. However, the Board's hands were subsequently tied by the intervention of one Member from Ohio.  One Member from Ohio continuously introduces legislation to block the name change. By its own policy, the Board refuses to act on a name change of a geographic feature when there is pending legislation concerning it, even if the measure is never considered. Thus, one single Representative can block a name-change within a State sought by the State's duly elected representatives. Whatever happened to the principle of federalism?  Far from memorializing a president in an appropriate manner, the name Mt. McKinley is now the source of confusion for millions of visitors to Denali National Park, the correctly named park hosting the mountain with the misfit moniker. Congress in 1980 dispelled this confusion half-way by redesignating the former Mt. McKinley National Park as Denali National Park and Preserve. Consistency dictates we use the name Denali for the mountain at the heart of the park.  I have nothing against naming a natural landmark after a U.S. President; it is an appropriate and honorable way to memorialize this nation's Presidents. However, William McKinley's deepest roots were in the State of Ohio, which is why he's known as the Idol of Ohio.  I respectfully suggest the gentleman from the State of Ohio re-designate a federal forest or similar landmark of his district after President McKinley if he wishes to honor this great president's memory. I am more than willing to assist him in this task.  My bill formally redesignates Mount McKinley as Denali, and requires the Interior Department to reflect this correction in all maps, references, and products put out by the United States government. This bill is not symbolic. It will be moved and receive its due consideration in this Congress.  Congress should end a long-running, 26 year controversy and name the mountain after what the people of the State of Alaska want it to be called: Denali.                          ____________________
