 Madam Speaker, I reject wholly and fully the premise underlying the whip's representation. There is no unfairness in this process.  The Republicans are like the lawyer who does not have the facts, because if he has the facts, he pounds on the facts; or if he has the law on his side, he pounds on the law. But if he neither has facts nor the law on his side, he pounds on the table, Madam Speaker. He makes noise.  The Republicans talk about process, not the substance. And the process, quite interestingly enough, is much of what the Republicans put in the rules that we included in our rules when we adopted them.  And as the whip clearly knows, one of the strongest advocates and defenders of the President of the United States sits there in the hearing, asks questions, can review documents, and could go right back to the White House and to all of your Members and say: This is what happened.  There is no unfairness in this, and no requirement that we have a vote. The committee is doing its job of fact-finding. Frankly, the White House counsel wrote a letter filled with eight pages that clearly misconstrues the status of this process; treats it as if it were thetrial. We do not conduct the trial, Madam Speaker. The Senate conducts the trial.  And just as in our legal due process system, when that occurs, the President will have all of that due process, I am sure, extended to him by the House of Representatives. That is not what this proceeding is.  This proceeding is to decide whether there is probable cause to think that the President of the United States has committed high crimes and misdemeanors. We have not made that conclusion yet, and we may not make it if the facts do not lead us there.  As Mr. Schiff pointed out in his letter to all of the Members, there is a very definite reason why grand juries and this committee are doing its process with full participation by the Republican Members of the Select Committee on Intelligence; full participation.  It is because witnesses ought not to be forewarned of what somebody else has said. Why? So that they don't parrot the other witness but tell the truth as they know it to be.  And I will tell the gentleman, the other reason grand juries are in secret is to protect the innocent, so that if there is no probable cause, there will be no assertion that somebody alleged that somebody did something wrong.  But the Republicans have been pounding on process and the reason for that, Madam Speaker, is they don't even want to discuss the substance. Of course, the Acting Chief of Staff did discuss substance. It is on the front page of The Washington Post. Of course we do this.  So I will tell my friend, this process is fair. It is consistent with the rules. It is consistent with the Constitution of the United States. It is consistent with the laws of this country. It is about one of the most serious matters we can deal with, and we don't want to make it a circus.  Yes, the committee is doing its work in camera, so to speak, adducing the facts. And your Members, and, particularly, one of the President's strongest supporters, defenders, and collaborators is sitting in the room every time the hearing occurs--unless he absences himself--and the Members of that committee, which you have appointed--not you personally, but your conference has appointed--are sitting in the room, equal time asking questions.                              {time}  1130  This hearing is fair, judicious, and thoughtful. And the attempt to besmirch the chairman of the committee is shameful. He is a fair and experienced Member of this body who has conducted himself as he should.  It is our constitutional responsibility, Madam Speaker, to see the facts behind conduct that may rise to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor. We don't know that to be the case, but if it is, we will meet our duty to the Constitution, to the laws of this Nation, and to the American public.
