 Lugar, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Cardin, and Mr. Durbin) submitted the following resolution, which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:                              S. Res. 432       Whereas, on August 30, 2006, the United Nations Security      Council approved United Nations Security Council Resolution      1706, providing that the existing United Nations Mission in      Sudan (UNMIS) ``shall take over from [the African Mission in      Sudan (AMIS)] responsibility for supporting the      implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement upon the      expiration of AMIS' mandate but in any event no later than 31      December 2006'';       Whereas, on July 31, 2007, the United Nations Security      Council approved United Nations Security Council Resolution      1769 reaffirming Resolution 1706 and stating that the      Security Council ``[d]ecides . . . to authorise and mandate      the establishment . . . of an AU/UN Hybrid operation in      Darfur (UNAMID) . . . [and] [d]ecides that UNAMID, which      shall incorporate AMIS personnel and the UN Heavy and Light      Support Packages to AMIS, shall consist of up to 19,555      military personnel, including 360 military observers and      liaison officers, and an appropriate civilian component      including up to 3,772 police personnel and 19 formed police      units comprising up to 140 personnel each'';       Whereas, on December 31, 2007, the United Nations-African      Union hybrid mission formally assumed control of peacekeeping      operations in Darfur, but did so with only approximately      9,000 troops and police on the ground, far short of both the      authorized and necessary levels;       Whereas the Government of Sudan continues to obstruct      implementation of Security Council Resolutions 1706 and 1769      in several respects, including by refusing to conclude a      Status of Forces Agreement or to cooperate on issues such as      the force composition, the authorization of night flights,      customs clearance, land access, and visas for staff;       Whereas, on January 7, 2008, uniformed elements of the army      of Sudan attacked a clearly marked UNAMID supply convoy,      severely wounding a Sudanese civilian driver;       Whereas rebels, militias, government forces, bandits, and      others continue to prey upon the people of Darfur and upon      humanitarian workers, increasing the urgency of both      deploying the full complement of peacekeepers and police and      of reaching a lasting political settlement;       Whereas the preliminary results of a United Nations      assessment entitled the ``Food Security and Nutrition      Assessment of the Conflict-Affected Population of Darfur      (August/September 2007)'' reveal that global acute      malnutrition in Darfur increased in 2007, exceeding emergency      levels in some regions;       Whereas the United Nations-African Union Mission in Sudan      has been hampered not only by obstruction by the Government      of Sudan and other obstacles to peace in the region, but by      the failure of the international community to commit the      resources, equipment, and personnel needed to carry out the      peacekeeping mission, most notably the failure to provide      critically needed aviation and transportation assets;       Whereas the United Nations-African Union Mission in Sudan      needs, among other critical mobility capabilities that have      not been met, 18 utility helicopters and 6 tactical      helicopters and crews;       Whereas, in a report to the Security Council dated December      24, 2007, the Secretary-General termed these helicopters      indispensable and stated that ``UNAMID must be capable of      rapid mobility over large distances, especially over terrain      where roads are the exception. Without the missing      helicopters, this mobility--a fundamental requirement for the      implementation of the UNAMID mandate--will not be      possible.'';       Whereas a large number of countries possess the military      assets that could help to fulfill this requirement;       Whereas the United States continues to lead the world in      its contributions to efforts to end the genocide in Darfur,      including by providing more than $4,500,000,000 since 2004 in      response to the Darfur crisis;       Whereas continued failure on the part of the international      community to take all steps necessary to generate, deploy,      and maintain an effective United Nations-African Union hybrid      peacekeeping force will result in the continued loss of life      and further degradation of humanitarian infrastructure in      Darfur; and       Whereas it would be inexcusable for the international      community to allow an authorized peacekeeping mission      intended to help bring an end to genocide and its effects to      founder or be compromised because of a failure to commit      critical elements, such as the 24 helicopters needed to meet      the critical mobility capabilities of the United Nations-     African Union Mission in Sudan: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) urges the members of the international community,      including the United States, that possess the capability to      provide the tactical and utility helicopters needed for the      United Nations-African Union peacekeeping mission in Darfur      to do so as soon as possible; and       (2) urges the President to intervene personally by      contacting other heads of state and asking them to contribute      the aircraft and crews for the Darfur mission.
