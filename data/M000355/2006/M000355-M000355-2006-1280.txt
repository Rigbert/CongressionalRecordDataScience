 President, this morning we will have a period of morning business for up to 30 minutes and then resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 2271, the USA PATRIOT Act Reauthorizing Amendments Act.  As a reminder, at 10:30 this morning we will have a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to that bill. As under the previous order, if cloture is invoked, we will proceed immediately to the bill itself. We still have a number of items to complete before next week's recess. The leader will have more to announce on the schedule later in the day.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
