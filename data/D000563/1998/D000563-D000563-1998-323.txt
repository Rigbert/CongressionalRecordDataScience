President, I rise today to congratulate the people of Israel and all my friends in the American Jewish community on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the creation of the State of Israel.  This significant milestone in Israel's history offers all of us an opportunity to reflect on what makes that country so special. Israel remains the most important U.S. ally in the Middle East and the only multiparty democracy in the region. The strong and stable friendship between our two countries, built on a solid foundation of shared values, mutual support and trust, is in the fundamental interest of both nations. Ensuring the security of Israel will remain one of our most important foreign policy priorities.  Transcending political considerations, however, are the profound ties with Israel and pride in its accomplishments felt by Jews worldwide. The State of Israel was created in the wake of the Holocaust and the tragic deaths of more than 6,000,000 Jews. Israeli society and its democratic institutions have been forged under the most difficult historical circumstances imaginable. Israel continues today to embody the aspirations of Jews from the northernmost villages of the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union to the tip of South America. The struggle of all Jews helped to create the State of Israel, and all Jews have reason to celebrate the country's 50th birthday.  It is my hope that Israel's next 50 years will see the establishment of apermanent and secure peace in the Middle East, with Israel and its Arab neighbors working together to build a better future for all the citizens of the region. This would truly fulfill Israel's promise and its destiny.                           ____________________
