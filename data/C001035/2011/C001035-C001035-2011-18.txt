President, I rise today to introduce the Volunteer Emergency Services Recruitment and Retention Act of 2011. This bill fixes a long-standing problem with the tax code that harms the ability of volunteer fire departments to recruit and retain both firefighter and emergency service personnel.  For years, local and state governments have provided their volunteer firefighters and EMS personnel with different forms of benefits including Length of Service Award Plans, commonly known as LOSAPs. These are pension-like benefits for volunteer emergency responders.  Unfortunately, the way the tax code handles LOSAPs hinders departments' abilities to administer the plans and makes it more difficult for volunteer emergency personnel to receive the benefits.  My bill would simplify the taxation of LOSAPs in two steps. First, it would allow LOSAPs to be elected as deferred compensation plans, and second, it would exempt them from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. This bill makes these necessary changes, which will improve access to LOSAP benefits for volunteer emergency responders, without increasing federal spending.  Today, an estimated 180,000 volunteer firefighters across 27 states participate in some form of LOSAP. Many states that do not offer these benefits would be more likely to do so if the federal tax code were simplified. This, in turn, would help volunteer fire departments to more easily recruit and retain personnel. These men and women our local first responders--are the foundation of our emergency response capabilities.  These volunteers put their lives on the line to help protect our communities, and their spirit of selflessness and service should be rewarded. I am proud to introduce this legislation with Senators Schumer and Blumenthal, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this bill through the Senate and into law.  Mr. President, I would ask for unanimous consent that a letter of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               Maine Fire Chiefs' Association,                                  Augusta Maine, November 8, 2011.     Re ``Volunteer Emergency Services Recruitment and Retention          Act of 2011.''     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     Dirksen Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins The Maine Fire Chiefs' Association is      a 425 member organization that represents fire and EMS      services in every county in the State of Maine. The Maine      Fire Chiefs' Association is charged with regularly advising      the Legislature and the Governor and providing      recommendations regarding necessary changes to Maine's fire      service system. The Maine Fire Chiefs' Association represents      numerous fire and emergency service interests in Maine.      Members of the Maine Fire Chiefs' Association represent      fulltime, call and volunteer firefighters.       The recruitment and retention of experienced emergency      responders is a priority of the Maine Fire Chiefs'      Association and Maine's fire service. The majority of Maine's      fire departments rely on call and/or volunteer firefighters      and the recruitment and retention of these crucial volunteers      is the number one issue facing the volunteer fire service      today. Length of Service Award Programs (LOSAPs)--pension-     like programs for volunteer emergency responders--are      effective recruitment and retention tools and are quite      popular among the volunteer fire service.       In 2009, the Maine Fire Chiefs' Association proposed the      following legislation--L.D. 1499 ``An Act To Establish the      Maine Fire Protection Services Commission Length of Service      Award Program''--offering a LOSAP to emergency responders in      Maine. Although there was support for the bill's concept      during the public hearing process, members of the Criminal      Justice and Public Safety Committee cited the potential      problems associated with the present federal tax laws--     specifically that the Internal Revenue Code, Section 457,      does not include LOSAPs--and L.D. 1499 ultimately was not      passed. Federal legislation--H.R. 1792--was proposed in the      111th Congress but was not passed before adjournment. H.R.      376 ``Volunteer Emergency Services Recruitment and Retention      Act of 2011'' was submitted earlier this year in the House of      Representatives and sponsorship of similar legislation in the      Senate is anticipated.       The Maine Fire Chiefs' Association respectfully requests      your sponsorship of this important legislation for emergency      responders. Length of service award programs are important      recruitment and retention tools for communities who primarily      rely on volunteers. By clarifying the tax treatment of      LOSAPs, local communities will find it easier to establish      and administer these programs. H.R. 376 would not create new      LOSAPS, place additional requirements on existing LOSAPs or      require communities to provide LOSAPs to their volunteer      emergency responders. LOSAPs would create incentives for      firefighters to remain in the fire service and encourage new      members to join the fire service. The Maine Fire Chiefs'      Association joins the Fire Commission, the Maine State      Federation of Firefighters, and many Maine fire departments      in thanking you for similar senate sponsorship.       The Maine Fire Chiefs' Association thanks you for your      strong support of the fire service and consideration of this      important issue. We welcome the opportunity to discuss this      proposal and other fire service issues at your convenience,           Respectfully,                                        Chief Stephen Nichols,                                                        President,                                   Maine Fire Chiefs' Association.                                 ______                                       By
