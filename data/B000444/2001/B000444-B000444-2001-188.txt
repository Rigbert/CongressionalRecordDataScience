 President, today I introduce a bill which would right a wrong, a small wrong, but a wrong nevertheless. It affects a handful of our nation's diplomats who serve in the world's most dangerous places: places like Bosnia and Lebanon. Our diplomats serve in some pretty difficult places, often in harm's way, just as our soldiers do.  These diplomats who serve in the most dangerous places receive a special allowance, which is aptly called ``danger pay.'' This allowance is not unlike that paid to our military when they are in combat. In fact, in some places where our military and diplomatic personnel serve side by side, both receive a special allowance for their sacrifices.  The military justifiably receives this benefit tax-free. But our diplomatic personnel do not. Through an oversight in the Internal Revenue code, diplomats are taxed on their danger pay, even though they often face similar hardships and dangers. I think that's wrong.  The bill I introduce today, I have a bill which would right this wrong. It affects just a handful of people. But to them it will serve as recognition of the sacrifice they make when they represent the American people in dangerous places overseas.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 750       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
