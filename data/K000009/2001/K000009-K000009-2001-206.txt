We want to walk alongside them. As they get through this particular crisis, we know their country will be stronger, just as ours will be stronger as a result of the crises that we have been through.  We expressed our deep regrets to the families who are so troubled by the disappearance of Mr. Gongadze, and we also reiterated and believe that in the meeting with the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon) and President Kuchma, we got the first commitment of an agreement from the Ukrainian government to use resources in the West to help get at the bottom of what actually created the crime.  We urge the government of Ukraine to use us. We believe that the confidence of the people of Ukraine and the West depends on a fair and thorough investigation of the facts. We are going to be introducing a resolution here in the House to express the sense that this Congress wants this incident resolved peacefully.  So I wanted to say to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon) for the Record this evening, I just again want to thank the gentleman so very much for the gentleman's international leadership in bringing this all together and doing what is historically correct and imperative for peace in this new millennium.  Mr. Speaker, I also include for the Record an article that relates to Russia and some of the difficulties that church-related organizations are having in accessing properties.  The article referred to is as follows:                        Ice Curtain in the East                          (By Geraldine Fagan)       On 7 January, Russia's Orthodox Church celebrated the two-     thousandth anniversary of the birth of Christ. Thousands      attended the Christmas liturgy in Moscow's Cathedral of      Christ the Saviour, triumphantly, and, many have averred,      tastelessly, restored to the city's skyline more than 60      years after Stalin ordered its obliteration from it. Live      coverage of the event was marred, however, when Patriarch      Alexis II arrived more than an hour late, delayed by his      participation in the day's informal meetings between      President Putin and the German Chancellor, Gerhard Schroder.      As the television cameras panned in on the massed faithful      awaiting their Patriarch, they picked out the emerald robes      of seemingly the most senior cleric in attendance--Mufti      Talgat Tadzhuddin, head of Russia's Central Spiritual      Directorate of Muslims. For the third year running, the chief      representative of Russia's Roman Catholics, Tadeusz      Kondrusiewicz, had not been invited.       Catholic-Orthodox relations in Russia remain poor. The      Moscow Patriarchate's frequent complaints that the Catholic      Church is engaging in rampant proselytism translate into a      state policy of containment. In Moscow, there are 27 Masses      in more than 10 languages every Sunday--almost all of which      take place under two roofs. Attempts to reclaim the third      historically Catholic building of the church of SS Peter and      Paul in order to relieve the strain have been fruitless. When      Cardinal Angelo Sodano acting as papal legate made a request      to Mayor Luzhkov's office for three plots of land to build      chapels in lieu of the return of the church of SS Peter and      Paul, he reportedly received a strong and swift rejection.       According to one Catholic source in Moscow, the Catholic      Church has agreed not to create any new institutions or      structures in the city, so that the number of legally      registered parishes totals five. The remainder--including      those which group Filipinos, Latin Americans, Koreans and      Iraqis--are either termed ``pastoral points'' in an official      directory of the Catholic Church in Russia for the year 2000,      or else are not listed at all. In addition, the two apostolic      administrations (``diocese'' would be too provocative a term)      of southern European Russia and eastern Siberia have been      denied registration because they are headed by foreigners.      Bishop Jerzy Mazur, a Pole, and Bishop Clemens Pickel, a      German, have been told that they will be granted Russian      citizenship only if they marry a Russian, and currently have      to pass any noninternal documentation--such as invitations      for visiting foreign clergy--to their counterparts with legal      status in Moscow or Novosibirsk. By contrast, the American-     born Berl Lazar, the Kremlin's preferred choice as chief      rabbi over Adolf Shayevich, who is backed by the      industrialist and oligarch Vladimir Gusinsky, faced no      obstruction in obtaining Russian citizenship.       The chancellor of the Moscow-based European Apostolic      Administration, the Catholic priest Fr Igor Kovalevsky,      insists that the Catholic Church in Russia ``is just trying      to function normally and provide for its minority here. We      are not posing any competition at all.'' With 60 per cent of      the Russian population claiming to be Orthodox, and the      Catholic Church bending over backwards to keep to its own      while simultaneously supporting the Orthodox through      foundations such as Aid to the Church in Need, it is intended      difficult to see why the Catholic minority of approximately      500,000 is subject to so much hostility.       Orthodox fears of competition appear more realistic,      however, when one takes into account the fact that so few      Russians are truly touched by Orthodoxy. Where they have a      presence, Catholics might constitute 1 per cent of the      population, with practising Orthodox making up another 3 per      cent. In addition, the concentration of Orthodox parishes is      such that 8,450, or almost half, are situated not in Russia,      but in the west in Ukraine. The vast area of Siberia east of      the Yenisei River, by contrast, contains approximately 500      parishes. The Orthodox Church's current total of 19,000      parishes is still only a fraction of the 78,000 it had before      the Revolution, and the euphoria of the early 1990s when many      new believers were received is a thing of the past.       Does this mean that the much-vaunted revival of Orthodoxy      in Russia is a fiction? Many Western commentators have looked      for it in vain, expecting a healthy revival to exhibit      certain characteristics, such as social work, a desire for      ecumenical dialogue or a move towards modernising liturgical      language. By contrast, they have seen a rise in nationalism      within the Church coupled with virulent anti-Catholicism.       If one can speak of a revival, it does not exhibit those      characteristics sought for by Western Christians. There is a      core of sincere, sober-minded practising Orthodox in Russia      devoted to their Church, but they tend to concentrate upon      the vertical aspects of church life. Asked whether there had      been an Orthodox revival in Russia, one young parishioner      told me that it was difficult to know hat such a revival      would be like from the point of view of the New Testament,      since ``God's kingdom is not of this world''. In the light of      such sentiments, it is perhaps easier to understand why one      of the strongest elements of revival is not in the social      sphere, but monasticism. Compared with their Christian      counterparts in western Europe, however, practising Orthodox      are stronger within sections of society such as academia and      youth, where they tend to enjoy the respect of their non-     believing peers rather than experiencing their scepticism.       Nationalist feeling among these practising Orthodox,      however, remains passive. Nationalists prefer to parade on      the streets with banners rather than attend church, and, as      before the Revolution, only a tiny minority of Orthodox      monarchists belong to the virulently nationalist Black      Hundreds movement. There are in any case two forms of      nationalism in Russia--Stalinist and pre-revolutionary. Most      nationalists belong in the first category and are indifferent      to religion. This does not stop them from being opposed to      the institution of the Catholic Church, however, since there      is a general perception that it belongs to an organised anti-     Russian force, and all Russians were taught in school that      Catholics were crusaders from the Baltics repelled by the      national hero Alexander Nevsky.       Although punching above their weight, practising Orthodox      in favour of ecumenical dialogue are indeed very few. In the      Soviet era, the pro-ecumenical element within the Church      gained an artificial influence because of its usefulness to      the foreign policy aims of the regime, and precisely for that      reason is now frequently viewed with derision by post-revival      practising believers. For most Orthodox, ecumenical dialogue      with Catholics (and others) is impossible for a simple      reason--they are heretics. To Russian Orthodox, however, this      does not necessarily conjure up emotive images of burnings at      the stake: one parishioner matter-of-factly explained to me      that the word ``heresy'' merely derives from the Greek for      ``opinion''; that is, anything deviating from Orthodox      tradition is the product of the mistaken human notion that      this tradition could be improved upon.       In one Moscow parish I recently heard a sermon in which the      priest likened Orthodoxy to the calculation 22=4. At some      stage, he said, Catholics (and others) decided that in fact      it would be more accurate to say 22=4.000025. ``You can build      a chair with     those people using their calculations and it will turn out      all right'', he explained to the congregation, ``but if you      both build spaceships and set your course on a far-off      planet, their spaceship will end up somewhere else''. The      Catholic concept promoted by Pope John Paul II of a Europe      breathing with two lungs, East and West, is not theologically      possible for Orthodox in Russia. No amount of sensitive      diplomacy and donations of floating churches from Catholics      will change that.       There are signs, however, that the Vatican might be      becoming wise to all this. The passivity towards Orthodox      criticism throughout the past decade in Russia, culminating      in intense diplomatic efforts to bring the Pope here in the      symbolic year of 2000, has brought few returns. In the light      of this, it is of some significance that the recently-     returned and restored Church of the Immaculate Conception in      Moscow is now openly referred to as a cathedral. Of much      greater import is the planned papal visit to predominantly      Orthodox Ukraine, set up without the agreement of the leader      of the only officially-recognised Orthodox Church in that      country--the one that gives allegiance to the Moscow      Patriarchate. It looks as if Catholic-Russian Orthodox      relations might be about to become stormier, if also more      open.
