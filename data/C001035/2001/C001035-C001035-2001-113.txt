President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Senator has raised an important issue dealing with the appropriate treatment of those who are known as the notch babies.  We all know this is not the bill on which to resolve this issue. We need to take up that issue in the context of modernizing our Social Security system, and this is just another attempt to delay final passage of the tax bill. So I encourage my colleagues to oppose this amendment regardless of their views on the underlying issue, and let's get on with the vote and approve this bill.
