 Speaker, I submit for printing in the Record statements by high school students from my home State of Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people today. I believe that the views of these young persons will benefit my colleagues.                                Tobacco                      (On behalf of Sara Sinclair)       Sara Sinclair: Hi. My name is Sara Sinclair.       I'm here to talk about an issue that in many ways relates      to nationwide health care, and in many ways would make it      more feasible, and that is tobacco control.       Right now in the state of Vermont, 36 percent of our peers      are addicted to nicotine, which is the active drug in      tobacco. 2,000 of us become addicted to it every year, and      roughly 12,000 of us, alive and in high school now, will die      because of tobacco use. And personally, that scarce me a      whole bunch.       I remember when I was in elementary school--I will be      graduating next year; I am a junior this year--and we were      the Smoke Free Class of 2000. In elementary school, we had      all these wonderful programs, and everyone said, ``Okay, I'm      not going to smoke,I'm not going to smoke.'' And as time wore      on, we got into high school, and the program sort of fell      away. And now I look at my peers, and I see a huge number of      them addicted to tobacco. Their skin is becoming wrinkled.      They get shaky when they don't have their cigarette. They      have this strong need for it.       And it's very frightening for me to see my peers addicted      to that so early, and to know that they will probably suffer      long-term effects from their tobacco use now. I have a ten-     year-old sister right now who says, ``I'm not going to smoke,      I'm not going to smoke.'' And I hope she will be able to hold      true to that. But I fear that, even if she does, that many of      her peers won't.       I think that the government needs to take strong steps to      prevent tobacco use in children and in teens, because it is a      very serious issue. And even though people say, sometimes,      ``Oh, teens are going to do whatever they want no matter      what,'' there are effective programs out there. I believe, in      the state of Massachusetts, the smoking rate amongst pregnant      mothers was cut in half by one particular program. And I      believe that there are effective programs out there that need      to be organized by our government. Luckily, our state      government here in Vermont has taken steps in that direction,      but we need it on a nationwide level, we need it to be      comprehensive, it needs to start before a child is in school,      in their preschool, on television, in the newspapers, and it      needs to continue right up through adulthood.       I also believe that there should be programs out there to      help adults, like my father right now, who is addicted to      nicotine and struggling with it. He is having an awful time      quitting. And there needs to be a program out there to help      people like him get rid of his addiction.       Congressman Sanders: Thank you for a very strong      presentation.                                       ____                        U.S. Intelligence Issues            (On behalf of Bethany Heywood and Laura Freeman)       Bethany Heywood: How would you feel if a total stranger      demanded your money and wouldn't tell you what it was being      used for, but assured you it wouldn't be misused? Would you      trust this person? Of course not. But this is essentially      what the CIA does to the American taxpayer, and with their      track record, we certainly shouldn't trust them to use our      money properly.       Taxpayers don't even know how much money the CIA receives,      although a rough estimate is $3.1 billion per year. In the      past, the CIA has used a substantial part of its budget to      finance covert operations, many of which we are just finding      out about. Details of covert operations aren't declassified      until decades after the actual event. Conveniently, by the      time a covert operation is disclosed, any public outrage that      might have erupted will have been squelched by the time      lapse.       Whether they're in the past or not, some of the CIA's      actions have been inexcusable: Assassinations, attempted      assassinations, massive propaganda efforts to prevent      undesirable people from winning foreign elections, operations      to topple democratically elected foreign leaders from power,      internal spying on American citizens, extensive mind control      experiments conducted at universities, prisons and hospitals.      The list goes on and on. Are these activities the government      should be spending money on?       Although the CIA is prohibited from engaging in      assassinations, attempts have been made to assassinate quite      a few foreign leaders. Some of the targets have been Castro,      DeGaulle, Khadafy, Khomeini and Hussein, just to name a few.      One of the CIA's supposed restrictions is that its limited to      intelligence operations on foreign soil only. Apparently, the      CIA has trouble discerning foreign soil from American soil,      because, in the 1970s, 300,000 Americans considered      potentially dangerous to national security were indexed in      the CIA computer. Citizens considered particularly dangerous      were place under surveillance, with bugs in their phones,      microphones in their bedrooms, or warrantless break-ins into      their homes.       One way to stop the CIA's activities would be to cut CIA      funding so there isn't enough for covert operations. Right      now, the president can direct the CIA to undertake a covert      operation, and is advised to do so by the National Security      Counsel, or NSC. Members of the NSC are appointed by the      president. This does not represent a diversity of people and      ideas, because the president is going to pick people who will      agree with him. If the members of the NSC were democratically      elected, the abuse of power by a small group of like-minded      individuals could be stopped.       Another way to make the decision of whether or not to go      ahead with the covert operation more democratically decided      would be to have congressional oversight. This might be seen      by some as too great a threat to CIA authority, but would      prevent unethical abuse of power.       The problems with CIA covert operations and abuse of power      won't go away overnight, but steps can and should be taken to      limit and hopefully eliminate covert operations.       Laura Freeman: I am speaking on the School of the Americas.       Would you willingly arm a murderer? Would you support the      education of some of the worst human rights violators in this      hemisphere? Would you finance a school which trained its      graduates in the most effective ways to interrogate,      including torture, blackmail and execution?       Whatever the answer of American citizens, every year, $20      million go from the taxpayers to a school that does exactly      these things. The School of the Americas, or SOA, was started      in Panama in 1946. Its original purpose was to train Latin      Americans in military techniques, which would allow them to      create stable democratic governments in Latin America, as      well as repress communist activities and revolutions.       SOA students learn combat skills, military intelligence,      commando tactics, sniper training, torture techniques, and      psychological warfare. Most of the courses resolve around      what they call counterinsurgency, states Father Roy      Bourgeois, a priest who has dedicated his time to protesting      the SOA.       Who are the insurgents? They are the poor. They are the      people in Latin America who call for reform. They are the      landless peasants who are hungry. They are healthcare      workers, human rights activists, labor organizers. They      become the insurgents. How do the graduates of the School of      the Americas use their skills? They murder priests and      archbishops, missionaries, and, perhaps worst of all,      civilians, their own people.       With the advent of the SOA's move to Fort Benning, Georgia,      the school has become something we are less and less able to      disassociate from. As Father Bourgeois said: ``We are talking      about a school of assassins right here in our backyard, being      supported by our tax money. It's being done in our name.''       What can we do to clear our name of this stain? The answer      is simple: Close the School of the Americas. We must act to      save the lives of people all over Latin America. To quote      Salvadorian Archbishop Oscar Romero, ``We who have a voice,      we have to speak for the voiceless.''                               ____________________
