 The point I am making is this: I have a friend, a woman I have known sinceshe was a young girl. She is married. She and her husband were unable to bring a child into this world. They went to the doctor and said: Could in vitro be the answer? The doctor said: We can try.  They spent $40,000 trying unsuccessfully. Heartbroken, they went home and waited and saved up enough money and borrowed enough money to try again, and they were successful. They have a beautiful baby whom they love to pieces.  They went to those extraordinary lengths because of their love for one another and their desire to bring life into this world together. I cannot believe there is anything immoral about that motive or that effort by this couple and hundreds or thousands of other couples across America.  The Senator from Kansas knows and I know that in the course of in vitro fertilization for these good reasons, there will be stem cells that are not going to be used to impregnate the woman who is seeking to have the baby. Some of them are frozen for future use, many are currently discarded. If the argument from the Senator from Kansas is that they are life and, therefore, cannot be used for research, then I can't understand why the Senator is not calling for the criminalization of in vitro fertilization which necessarily leads to excess stem cells.
