 President, I rise today to oppose Senator Domenici's amendment to require that U.S. refiners blend 8 billion gallons of ethanol into gasoline each year by 2012.  I think this is a mistake that will cost the Federal treasury $2 billion by the time it is fully implemented and could further pollute California's air.  In my home State, the mandate will mean that refiners must choose between blending ethanol into gasoline or using a costly credit/trading system.  Either choice will mean California consumers pay more at the pump.  Accordiing to the California Air Resources Board, California would be able to mitigate the air quality impacts of a mandate if it were limited to 6 billion gallons or less.  With a 6 billion gallon mandate, refiners in California would be required to use about 660 million gallons of ethanol, which they could accomplish in the cooler winter months alone.  However, at 8 billion gallons, the State's refiners would be forced to use about 880 million gallons of ethanol and they would either have to use ethanol in the hot summer months, when it could pollute the air, or buy costly ``credits'' for not using ethanol.  While we do not know exactly how the credit trading system will work, itis estimated that the credits would cost about 40 cents per gallon of ethanol.  So if California refiners were not able to use about 220 million gallons of ethanol per year, it could cost $88 million annually to buy the credits--money that would inevitably be passed on to drivers.  I do want to thank Chairman Domenici for including two provisions in the amendment that could help my State: repealing the 2 percent oxygenate standard; and maintaining the summertime waiver for California.  The Federal 2 percent oxygenate standard has forced areas with poor air quality, including the entire State of California, to use either MTBE or ethanol in gasoline.  This Federal requirement has forced California's refiners to use an oxygenate even though they can make cleaner-burning gasoline without MTBE or ethanol.  To meet this oxygenate requirement, California has been forced to use ethanol since 2004 when the State officially banned MTBE, although many refiners in the State started using ethanol as early as 2003.  Beginning in the Summer of 2003, ethanol was found to have had a detrimental impact on the State's air quality. And on August 1, 2003 the California Environmental Protection Agency informed me that:     . . . our current best estimate is that the increase in the      use of ethanol-blended gasoline has likely resulted in about      a one percent increase in emissions of volatile organic gases      (VOC) in the SCAQMD [South Coast Air Quality Management      District] in the summer of 2003. Given the very poor air      quality in the region and the great difficulty of reaching      the current federal ozone standard by the required attainment      date of 2010, an increase of this magnitude is of great      concern. Clearly, these emission increases have resulted in      higher ozone levels this year that what would have otherwise      occurred, and are responsible for at least some of the rise      in ozone levels that have been observed.  I will provide a copy of this letter for the record.  In September 2004, the California Air Resources Board sponsored a study by the Coordinating Research council entitled ``Fuel Permeation From Automotive Systems.''  The purpose of the study was to find out if three different fuels had different chemical properties that made one evaporate more rapidly then the others.  The fuels that were studied were MTBE-blended gasoline, ethanol-blended gasoline, and gasoline with no oxygenate.  The study found that emissions increased from all 10 of the gas tanks and engines that were studied when ethanol replaced the MTBE in gasoline.  In fact, the ethanol blended gasoline caused emissions to increase by 65 percent when compared with MTBE blended gasoline, and by 45 percent when compared with non-oxygenated gasoline.  Here's why: ethanol-blended gasoline evaporate from the car's parts faster and does so in a vapor form. Those vapors cause smog.  Ethanol's evaporative tendencies only get worse in hot climates. The Air Resources Board has since found that the use of ethanol on hot summer days increases emissions of ozone forming compounds by about 75 tons per day above what they would be if we were allowed to use summertime gasoline without ethanol.  This is important because ozone can cause respiratory difficulties in the elderly and those with asthma.  There is a strong direct relationship between temperature and ethanol--the hotter the day, the higher the emissions. On a 100 degree day, emissions are four times higher than on a 68 degree day. Therefore, the worst time to use ethanol is in the summer months.  Overall, the Air Resources Board believes that ozone levels in California are about 1 to 2 percent higher than they should be because of the oxygenate requirement.  This is a significant problem. Almost all of California's 37 million residents already breathe unhealthy air. Current levels of ozone pollution annually result in an estimated 630 premature deaths; 4,200 hospitalizations for respiratory diseases; and 3.7 million school absences.  The Energy Committee approved my amendment to this bill to provide California with a waiver so that the State does not have to use ethanol in the summertime when ethanol-blended gasoline impacts air quality the most.  I do appreciate the fact that Chairman Domenici has retained this waiver in his amendment. However, I still believe the ethanol mandate is bad public policy, which increases the cost of gasoline for consumers; does next to nothing to reduce oil consumption to increase energy security; and, has severe impacts on the federal budget.  Last month, the Director of the Petroleum Division at the Energy Information Administration stated before the House Government Reform Committee that:       . . . refiners lost production capability when replacing      MTBE with ethanol. This, along with continued demand growth,      has contributed to price pressures. From 2000 through 2002,      California retail gasoline prices averaged about 19 cents per      gallon more than the U.S. average gasoline price, but in 2003      as MTBE began to be removed, California prices averaged 27      cents per gallon higher than the U.S. average, and remained      at that level through 2004.  So far this year, California's gasoline prices are at least 23 cents higher than the U.S. average.  Much of this additional cost can be attributed to the cost of transporting ethanol. Because ethanol cannot be transported through the existing pipeline infrastructure and has to be trucked from the Midwest to the coasts, it adds another 10 cents to the retail cost of gasoline.  In other words, adding ethanol to our gasoline has increased the cost at the pump.  Moreover, the ethanol mandate does not improve energy security. The ethanol mandate will only reduce U.S. oil consumption by one-half of one percent when the 8 billion gallon mandate is fully implemented in 2012.  In addition, since ethanol has a somewhat lower energy content, more fuel is required to travel the same distance.  This energy loss leads to an approximate 3 percent decrease in miles per gallon vehicle fuel economy with ethanol-blended gasoline.  And finally, I would like to point out how expensive this mandate is. Ethanol receives a tax credit of 51 cents per gallon. If the mandate were to increase to 8 billion gallons by 2012 from the 3.85 billion gallons of ethanol sold today, that would mean a net loss of an additional $2 billion to the U.S. Treasury.  We should not be imposing a larger mandate for ethanol at a time when the ethanol industry already receives such a huge subsidy, and when the Nation has such huge budget deficits.  We need to either eliminate the mandate or end the subsidy. We can keep one or the other but not both.  Yes, the provision to allow California not to use ethanol in the summertime is a win for California's air quality. But the mandate, itself, could well be a loss for consumers and the Federal Treasury.  I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing this amendment.  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from which I quoted be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                          California Environmental                                            Protection Agency,                                   Sacramento, CA, August 1, 2003.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: Thank you for your letter dated      July 15, 2003, in which you requested that the California      Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air      Resources Board (ARB/Board) investigate the impacts of      ethanol-blended gasoline and its potential contribution to      the recently degraded air quality in Southern California.       Like you, I am extremely concerned about the recent      increase in the number of exceedances of the federal ozone      standard and the high elevated peak ozone levels observed in      the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) this      summer. As you observe in your letter, the air quality in the      Los Angeles Basin has deteriorated this year, concurrent with      a dramatic increase in the use of ethanol-blended gasoline.       All of the causes of this year's increased ozone are not      yet known. In the two weeks since you wrote, the ARB has not      had sufficient time to fully determine the role that ethanol-     blended gasoline has played relative to other factors. We do      know that weather conditions have played a very important      role, and that increased use of ethanol-blended gasoline has      increased emissions over what they otherwise would have been.      That said, I also think it is fair to point out that     the impact of ethanol-gasoline blends, while significant and      of great concern in California's ongoing efforts to reduce      ozone, is not large enough to explain the majority of air      quality deterioration that occurred in the SCAQMD this      summer.       Unfortunately, at this time we are not able to precisely      quantify the magnitude of the impact that higher emissions      associated with the increased use of ethanol-blend gasoline      has had relative to either weather or other factors affecting      this year's ozone pollution. However, I would like to convey      what we know today about the potential impact of ethanol use      on emissions of smog forming compounds in Southern      California.       As you know, as part of our efforts to obtain a waiver from      the two percent oxygen requirement that now applies to most      of the gasoline sold in California, the ARB has prepared      extensive analyses of the impact of ethanol-gasoline blends      on emissions and air quality. This information was submitted      to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) to      support our waiver request, and showed that emissions of      ozone and particulate matter precursors would be reduced in      California if U.S. EPA approved the waiver request. '       In addition to the information previously submitted, the      ARB has continued to conduct studies to further our      understanding of how ethanol-blended gasoline would affect      emissions in California. As is explained below, our current      best estimate is that the increase in the use of ethanol-     blended gasoline has likely resulted in about a one percent      increase in emissions of volatile organic gases (VOC) in the      SCAQMD in the summer of 2003. Given the very poor air quality      in the region and the great difficulty of reaching the      current federal ozone standard by the required attainment      date of 2010, an increase of this magnitude is of great      concern. Clearly, these emission increases have resulted in      higher ozone levels this year than what would have otherwise      occurred, and are responsible for at least some of the rise      in ozone levels that have been observed.       To elaborate on the ARB's analyses, there are several ways      that the use of ethanol in gasoline could potentially      increase VOC emissions. The most import factors are:      increased volatility of gasoline; the commingling of ethanol      and non-ethanol blends in vehicle tanks; and permeation of      ethanol through hoses and fuel system components.       Your letter mentions the potential for ethanol to increase      the volatility of gasoline. Increases in volatility lead to      increases in evaporative emissions from both the fuel      distribution system and from vehicles. This effect may result      in emission increases in other parts of the Nation where      volatility of ethanol-gasoline blends is not tightly      controlled. However, the California Phase 3 Reformulated      Gasoline regulations, which ban the use of Methyl Tertiary      Butyl Ether (MTBE) in California gasoline, anticipated this      effect and required all gasoline to meet the same volatility      standards whether ethanol was used or not. In addition, these      regulations actually slightly lowered the volatility limit      that most gasoline must meet. Therefore, we do not believe      that this factor is contributing to increased VOC emissions      in California.       Commingling emissions occur when consumers fill their fuel      tanks and mix ethanol and non-ethanol gasolines. The      California Phase 3 Reformulated Gasoline regulations were      designed to preserve the existing Phase 2 Reformulated      Gasoline vehicle emission benefits and to provide additional      emission reductions to offset potential commingling effects.      However, in 1999 when these rules were adopted, there was      limited information on the real-world effects of commingling,      and the ARB committed to further analyze this issue.       Board staff recently completed a study of the likely      emissions impacts of commingling in California. Based on this      study, we continue to believe that the California Phase 3      Reformulated Gasoline regulations provide adequate      compensating reductions to offset the emission increases due      to commingling. The findings in the commingling study have      been submitted to the University of California for formal      peer review, and the review is expected to be completed      within the next month.       Increases in permeation emissions occur due to ethanol's      greater propensity (relative to most other components of      gasoline) to leak through the soft components of fuel lines      and through other parts of the fuel system. Because this      effect was not adequately quantified when the ARB adopted the      California Phase 3 Reformulated Gasoline regulation in 1999,      ARB staff was directed to investigate these impacts and to      return to the Board with recommendations on whether there is      a need to take further actions to address those impacts.       Preliminary results from this study are now available, and      strongly suggest that permeation impacts are both real and      significant. The ARB's analyses indicate that this effect      could increase ethanol evaporative hydrocarbon emissions by      between 10 and 15 tons per day in the SCAQMD at the current      level of ethanol use.       The information presented above is especially relevant in      light of the recent decision by the 9th Circuit Court that      overturns U.S. EPA's denial of California's oxygen content      waiver request, and requires U.S. EPA to reconsider this      issue. ARB believes that the information now available on the      impact of ethanol in gasoline on VOC emissions must be part      of U.S. EPA's reconsideration. We believe that the data on      commingling and permeation effects demonstrate that U.S.      EPA's denial of California's waiver request, which was based      on its conclusion that granting the waiver might lead to an      increase in overall VOC emissions due to commingling effects,      was in error. As part of our effort to gain a reversal of      this waiver denial, California is now preparing an      information package to submit this information to the U.S.      EPA.       I hope the information provided above is of value to you.      As in the past, I am sure that your office will be of great      assistance in assuring that California receives the needed      waiver, and I look forward to working with you on this      effort. Relative to understanding the factors that      contributed to higher ozone levels this summer, the ARB staff      will continue to work closely with SCAQMD staff to understand      the cause of the recent increases in ozone levels in southern      California. We will keep you informed of the results of this      effort. If you have any additional questions about this      important issue, please feel free to contact me, at (916)      323-2514, or Alan C. Lloyd, Ph.D., Chairman, ARB, at (916)      322-5840.           Sincerely,                                                Winston H. Hickox,     Agency Secretary.                                  ____
