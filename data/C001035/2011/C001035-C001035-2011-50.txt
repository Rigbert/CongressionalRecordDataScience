President, I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues this article from the Mountain Times in Killington, VT. The article highlights the outstanding work of the nearly 200 members of Maine National Guard's 133rd Engineer Battalion, headquartered in Gardiner, ME, which deployed to Vermont to help our neighbors deal with the destruction from Tropical Storm Irene. Senator Leahy has told me several times how grateful the people of Vermont are for the assistance and how impressed they are with the professionalism of the Maine National Guard members. All of us in Maine are extremely proud of their outstanding work helping those who needed it most. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                        Angels With Dirty Faces                           (By Greg Crawford)       Well, maybe their faces are clean, but the men and women of      the Maine National Guard's 133rd Engineer Battalion,      headquartered in Gardiner, Maine, and commanded by Lt.      Colonel Normand Michaud, sure got their boots muddy! And      despite modest denials, they are, indeed, angels, at least to      the grateful citizens of Stockbridge.       Following the historic flooding caused by the torrential      rains of tropical storm Irene, the call went out to National      Guard units in areas not quite so devastated by the storm,      and they answered that call with incredible speed. Given the      complexity of the logistics involved, and that the behemoth      trucks essential to their work do not exactly zip over the      road, especially when they have to negotiate flood-ravaged      terrain, the fact that they managed to get here just a few      days after the flooding occurred is nothing short of amazing.      The 38-vehicle caravan took 16 hours to make the trip from      Belfast, Maine, about 40 miles east of Augusta, where much of      the equipment was stored.       Something like a quarter of a mile of Vermont Route 107      between Bethel and Stockbridge was washed downstream. In some      places, the road hugged the near-vertical mountainsides with      the river right next to it. Following Sunday's deluge, the      river was rushing by at the foot of the mountain as if the      road had never been there at all.    A National Guard truck unloads pallets of bottled water at the                      Stockbridge Elementary School       But then the 133rd showed up, and things changes in a      hurry. Their first task upon arrival was to erect the tents      that would house the fifty-plus Guard members assigned to the      Route 107 site and others around Stockbridge. It was      fortunate that there was level ground beside Lambert's Power      Tools, directly adjacent to the damaged highway. Before they      could position the excavators, they had to build a dike to      keep the muddy waters of the not-so-White River out of the      area where their equipment would have to be situated. There's      very fine, muddy silt everywhere, and though they had a      couple of fair weather, the recent rains turned that silt      into a thick soup that would have brought mere mortals to a      standstill. But this is the 133rd Engineer Battalion. By      Wednesday morning, they had already managed to restore a      single, very rough lane where there had only been submerged      rubble. This was wet, dirty and dangerous work, but according      to Frank Lambert's daughter, one of the Guardswomen attached      to this unit commented that she'd rather be here in Vermont's      mud and rain than in Afghanistan. Small wonder. The 133rd has      lost members to IEDs in previous deployments to that war-torn      country.       That single lane of 107 is still barely navigable, even by      4-wheel drive vehicles, so it is not open to traffic as yet.      But it is there. For that alone, 2nd Lieutenant Rand and the      men and women of the 133rd Engineer Battalion have earned the      undying gratitude of the residents of Stockbridge and the      neighboring towns that depend on that highway.  A ``bucket brigade'' speeds the transfer of packaged bottled water                                 indoors       By the way, if anyone, Stockbridge resident or not, should      encounter a Guard member from the 133rd, or any other      National Guard unit here to help, tell them, thank you. SPC      Allison Pelletier of the 133rd's Public Affairs Office tells      me that a much-appreciated expression of gratitude would be      coffee and food. The MREs they're living on are better than      they used to be . . . but they're still MREs. Some Dunkin'      Donuts would go over pretty big, too, I'll bet. Hint, hint.       There are plenty of angels right here in Stockbridge, too.      So many, in fact, that you can't swing a cat without smacking      a Good Samaritan. My cat hates it when I do that.       Willis and Harry Whitaker, Mark Pelletier, Dave Brown,      Peter Steibris, and God-only-knows how many others put in      unbelievable hours making roads passable for emergency      vehicles. They also reinforced the damaged abutment of      Gaysville's 1929-vintage iron bridge.       Sid Hotchkiss and the McCullough brothers from Bethel have      been working on the monster hole in River Road with      bulldozers and an excavator.       Barbara Vellturo, Stephen Farrington, Cheryl Rivers, and      others have slaved away over hot computers ferreting out      information about the status of roads and bridges in      surrounding towns and getting that information to Stockbridge      residents by e-mail and postings to a Google Group called      Stockbridge Open Forum. Paul Buckley has scouted all those      roads daily to confirm the accuracy of the information.       Mark Doughty has coordinated meetings all over town to keep      people up to date and convey residents' concerns to town      officials.       Janet Whitaker has maintained a steady flow of information      from a multitude of sources to keep the group forum's      information current.       Jenny Harris has made innumerable runs to area pharmacies      for prescriptions so residents in need don't run out of      essential medications, and Mary Ellen Dorman, who knows      everyone in town, has seen to it that they were all delivered      to the right people.       Josh and Michelle Merrill, two former Gaysville residents      now living in Rutland, are the people who, with the help of      the Chittenden Fire Department and the Stockbridge Fire      Department, got the ball rolling for the food shelves at the      Stockbridge Elementary School and on the Stockbridge Common.      Fifteen volunteers give of their time to organize and      dispense all the items that fill the school's multi-purpose      room.       Every day, there are people going out of their way to help      someone. They neither expect, nor ask for, recognition; they      just do what they know is right and move on. Makes it hard to      catch 'em in the act.       Several people whose homes were damaged or destroyed, and      those who simply can't get to their homes, have been taken in      by generous and thoughtful neighbors. Furniture and      appliances have been donated, or at least promised, to people      in the process of rebuilding. Special efforts have been made      to care for elderly, ill, or disabled residents, including      helicopter and ambulance evacuations.       Were it possible to recount them all, the incidents of      selfless generosity and assistance given to those less      fortunate would fill this paper and two or three issues to      come. Only a few have been mentioned here by name, but many      more deserve recognition. However, I feel quite certain they      are all content with the knowledge that they did some good.                          ____________________
