Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, Senate bill 320 consists of noncontroversial, technical amendments to the patent, trademark, and copyright laws. This bill corrects clerical and other technical drafting errors, and makes important clarifications in the American Inventors Protection Act which was enacted into law during the 106th Congress.  It also makes technical changes to title I of the Intellectual Property and Communications Omnibus Reform Act of 1999, title 17, and other copyright and related technical amendments.  On February 14, 2001, S. 320 passed the other body by a recorded vote of 98 to 0. However, upon further review, drafting errors were discovered in the bill. The Committee on the Judiciary adopted an amendment in the nature of a substitute which corrected the drafting errors. The amendment and S. 320, as amended, were unanimously agreed to by voice vote in the committee.  These are important and necessary amendments to our intellectual property laws, and I urge Members to support S. 320.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
