President, this past January 31, around 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock in the morning, I tried to imagine what I would say in my first Senate floor speech. I reflected a bit on what I had learned from Oregonians during the campaign that sent me here.  Though I had not slept a whole lot for many days, I had no problem piecing together what the election was allabout: Oregonians, regardless of who they voted for, are hungry for real solutions. In many ways, ideological purity--looking at Government through a set of partisan blinders--is far less important to the people of my State than making the Government work.
