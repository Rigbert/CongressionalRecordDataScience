Chairman, there is a second program, and this is a little bit personal to my district. There is a program which the gentleman is familiar with, the National Guard Youth Challenge Program. It actually operates in Oregon in the district of the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Bob Smith).  But if the gentleman is aware of the tragic shooting that took place in the high school near my home in Springfield, rather sadly, the father of that youth was attempting on the day that he was killed to enroll the youth into the National Guard Youth Challenge Program, because it has such an incredible reputation in our State. They have put more than 500 at-risk youth through that program, and Major General Reese told me that only 4 of those youths out of 500 have committed crimes after going through that program.  I realize that the administration only requested $28.5 million, and I certainly intend to put efforts into getting the administration to ask for more next year. I realize that the chairman has upped that by $10 million during the committee process.  It is my great hope that the chairman can strive to reach, at least in conference, the $50 million level, which would maintain the current services. There are States, including that of the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murtha) on the waiting list.  I would hope, I know the chairman supports the program, I would hope that we can strive to at least make the program whole and perhaps get to some of the States on the waiting list in the near future.
