 This administration told us we needed to invade Iraq because there were nuclear weapons there, which we cannot find.  They told us we needed to invade Iraq because there was uranium, fissile material coming in from Africa to Iraq, which now they say did not exist.  They told us we needed to invade Iraq because of weapons of mass destruction, which we cannot find.  They told us we needed to invade Iraq because of their linkage with 9/11 terrorists, which now the President has said is not a fact.  They told us we didn't have to worry about rebuilding Iraq because of all the oil revenues.  Is the Senator from North Dakota finding the same difficulty I am in following their logic? All the reasons to invade Iraq have disappeared. As I understand it, the oil is still there. The oil was supposed to be the source to rebuild Iraq. Is the administration suggesting there is no oil in Iraq?
