 President, I rise today to co-sponsor legislation, the ``Tax Shelter Transparency and Enforcement Act"to address the continuing proliferation of tax shelters. This bill reflects tax shelter measures that have been passed by the Senate Finance Committee in the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Act of 2003, the CARE Act, the JOBS Act, and the Energy bill. The full Senate has passed these shelters provisions twice this year.  We have known for many years that abusive tax shelters, which are structured to exploit unintended consequences of our complicated Federal income tax system, erode the federal tax base and the public's confidence in the tax system. Such transactions are patently unfair to the vast majority of taxpayers who do their best to comply with the letter and spirit of the tax law. The Finance Committee produced its first draft of tax shelter legislation in 1999, and has produced several subsequent bills, each of which were enhanced to attack new developments in abusive tax shelters. The most recent Finance Committee bill was the Tax Shelter Transparency Act in May 2002. Today's bill builds on that 2002 legislation by adding certain corporate governance provisions, the recommendations from the Finance Committee's tax shelter investigation of Enron, and a proposal to clarify the judicial economic substance doctrine.  The Finance Committee has worked exceedingly hard over many several years to develop a legislative response to tax shelters, and the bill we offer today may not be the final word in that response. Thoughtful and well-considered comments on the provisions in this bill have been greatly appreciated by the staff and members of the Finance Committee, and will be considered in further refining today's bill, particularly with respect to clarification of the economic substance doctrine.  In our ongoing efforts to end tax shelters, we have attacked the issue on several fronts. We have introduced numerous measures to end specific shelter abuses as they are discovered. We have offered legislation attacking corporate inversions, individual expatiations, and corporate deductions for phony leases of tax-payer funded subways, bridges, and water lines. I have pursued public disclosure of the differences in the income on financial statements reported by public companies to their shareholders, and the income the company reports to the IRS on its tax return. I have written to the President, Treasury and SEC to encourage them to consider this idea.  During the Senate's 2002 deliberation of the Sarbanes-Oxley bill, I attempted to add an amendment that would have prohibited auditors from opining on the financial statement results of tax shelters that they had sold to an audit client. I was blocked in my attempt to offer that amendment, with several members expressing skepticism about the need for such a measure. I suspect that today, however, few members would have such reservations.  On October 21st, 2003, the Senate Finance Committee conducted a hearing to determine if tax shelters were a continuing problem. Not only are they continuing, they are now expanding to mid-level companies and wealthy individuals, many of whom have been duped into engaging in shelter transactions. During our hearing, we heard testimony from taxpayers who relied on reputable tax professionals and accounting firms for sound tax advice, but unknowingly purchased tax shelters that were peddled by those trusted professionals through a web of collusion and deception. We also heard from employees of large accounting firms and major corporations who testified regarding the pressure exerted on them to bless transactions that, in their professional opinions, would constitute abusive tax shelters. The price for their integrity was the loss of their jobs and the ruin of their career. Tax shelter abuse must be stopped for the sake of fairness, the integrity of our tax system, and the protection of honest tax professionals.  Our years of work on this issue was recently reaffirmed in a hearing before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which explored abusive shelters that were promoted by purportedly reputable tax lawyers and accounting firms. Following that hearing, there has been considerable discussion of promoting an amendment similar to the one I offered in 2002 during the Sarbanes-Oxley debate, and I am appreciative of that effort. I hope we are able to construct a measure that can be readily enforced by the Public Accounting Oversight Board and the SEC, even though that agency lacks expertise in, or jurisdiction over, federal tax matters.  At its core, however, the problem is not an SEC matter, but is a problem of ongoing abuse of the tax code by very smart people doing some very ugly business. The only way to end this problem is to put it out in the open. Even the most cynical tax advisor does not want their dirty laundry in the public eye, particularly if that public includes the IRS. That is why disclosure of abusive or potentially abusive transactions is so important in solving this problem.  The Tax Shelter Transparency and Enforcement Act requires taxpayer disclosure of potentially abusive tax avoidance transactions. It is surprising and unfortunate that taxpayers, though required to disclose tax shelter transactions under present law, have refused to comply. The Tax Shelter Transparency and Enforcement Act will curb non-compliance by providing clearer and more objective rules for the reporting of potential tax shelters and by providing strong penalties for anyone who refuses to comply with the revised disclosure requirements.  The legislation has been carefully structured to reward those who are forthcoming with disclosure. I wholeheartedly agree with the remarks offered by a former Treasury Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy, that ``if a taxpayer is comfortable entering into a transaction, a promoter is comfortable selling it, and an advisor is comfortable blessing it, they all should be comfortable disclosing it to the IRS.'' Transparency is essential to an evaluation by the IRS and ultimately by the Congress of the United States as to whether the tax benefits generated by complex business transactions are appropriate interpretations of existing tax law.  It is time to get this bill done. The Finance Committee has worked on rooting out tax shelters for nearly five years, and we have debated the issue long enough. The time to act is now. I will vigorously pursue enactment of an anti-tax shelters bill in the upcoming year. I think we can all take pride in the Senate's consistent action of passing the measures in today's bill. We must press forward to put a final end to the seemingly endless abuse of tax shelters.                                 ______                                       By
