 President, I rise today to submit a resolution to commemorate the Zinfandel grape.  The Zinfandel grape has a long and unique history that mirrors the diversity and agricultural development of our nation. Unlike other grapes that today have international recognition--such as Cabernet, Chardonnay, or Pinot Noir--the Zinfandel grape is uniquely and distinctly American. One writer has referred to it as ``the Horatio Alger of varietals, the True American.''  While Zinfandel's exact origins are unclear, we know that it was consumed as a table grape in New England in the 1830's, and that Zinfandel cuttings from a nursery in Long Island were taken by the settlers as they headed west. During the California Gold Rush of 1849, Zinfandel vines were planted and their products consumed as table grapes and as wine. By the 1880's, Zinfandel was the most commonly planted red grape in the West, and the wine made from Zinfandel grapes began winning awards as early as 1859.  Today the Zinfandel grape is our most versatile of viticultural products. It is used in jams, jellies, pasta sauces, mustards, and other food products. It is produced as a wine in 14 states, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Ohio, Tennessee and Texas.  Zinfandel products now touch every region of the United States, yet knowledge of its uniquely American heritage is poor. I hope that passage of this resolution will bring greater awareness to the public of the notable and uniquely American attributes of this important agricultural product.  In my state, there are grape vines in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains that have been alive since the late 1800's. These ancient vines still produce grapes, and the genetic qualities of these grapes so interest scientists that the University of California at Davis has established a ``Heritage Vineyard'' project specifically to study these plants.  On a more prosaic level, these old vines are a living link to our past--to a time when many Americans living in the East uprooted themselves and moved to West to cultivate and settle the entire expanse of our country. We should recognize and treasure these historical connections to the development of our nation.  Mr. President, let me clarify that this resolution does not seek to commemorate an alcoholic product, or any particular commercial product. It does not seek to commemorate a ``western'' issue, since Zinfandel food products are consumed nationwide and Zinfandel grapes are made into wine in every major portion of the country. Indeed, the very origins of Zinfandel are in the East. Rather, my colleagues and I seek to commemorate a uniquely American agricultural product that has gained international recognition and that is produced and enjoyed in every part of this country.  I am pleased to submit this resolution to commemorate the Zinfandel grape and establish January 23-29, 2001, as Zinfandel Grape Appreciation Week.                          ____________________
