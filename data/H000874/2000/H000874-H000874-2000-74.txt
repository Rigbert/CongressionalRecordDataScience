Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee) for her very important contribution and her giving us another example of an extraordinary American leader who has been impacted in her family and by the images and inspirationgiven by Historically Black Colleges and Universities.  We are advantaged by the service of the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee) in the Congress; and that, I am sure, is in part due to the inspiration she received by all of those who were enriched and given hope and opportunity and vision by Historically Black Colleges.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the very distinguished gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis).
