President, recognition and congratulations are in order for a school and a group of young men known throughout Vermont for their honor, integrity and prowess on the hockey rink.  Norwich University, the nation's oldest private military college, sits in the picturesque town of Northfield, VT. It is a quaint college town, and it is a unique college, hosting a mix of military cadets and more traditional college students.  The cadets, as their hockey team is known, have a reputation for being an NCAA Division III hockey powerhouse. It is cold in Northfield this time of year, but a few weeks ago, Norwich University's Kreitzberg Arena was warmed by a sellout crowd gathered to watch the Cadets capture their second NCAA Division III hockey title in just four years.  The Cadets staged a come-from-behind 2-1 win over Oswego State on March 22 to capture the title. After trailing 1-0 going into the third period, Norwich was looking at the possibility of being shut out, something that has not happened to the program in 278 consecutive games, a streak dating back to the 1993-94 season. Junior defensemen Lou DiMasi, a Vermont native, was quoted by the Burlington Free Press on the team's third period comeback, saying: ``There was no way we were going to let it get away.'' Junior defensemen Aaron Lee scored his thirteenth goal of the season in the third period to tie the game, and senior team captain Toza Crnilovic notched the game-winning goal for the championship.  Norwich coach Mike McShane has built a remarkable record over the past 8 years, winning the Eastern College Athletic Conference East crown five times and reaching five ``Frozen Fours.'' Since Mike McShane began coaching the Cadets, the team has had five 20-win seasons accompanied by a long list of individual accomplishments for members of Cadet teams, including national players of the year and a long list of All-Americans.  Following the game, Coach McShane attributed part of the team's success to the great support the Cadets have from Norwich and Northfield. ``We've got great support here and that helps a lot. You saw the president and the chairman of the board of trustees out there at center ice in the celebration. You don't see that at many schools.''  Norwich finished the season with an impressive record of 27-3, and many of the Cadets' stars will be returning next year. And, as surely as the sugar rises each year in the maples, Vermonters next year will be closely following the Cadets through another great season. Until next winter, the Cadets have earned the right to bask in the glow of knowing they have accomplished another successful season, bought with hard work, skill and determination.                          ____________________
