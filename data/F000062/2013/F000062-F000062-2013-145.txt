 President, I would like to recognize and honor the incredible life of John Quimby, an inspirational leader that guided and touched the lives of so many.  John Quimby was born on February 12, 1935, in Prescott, AZ, to parents Henrietta and Merle Quimby. The family later moved to California and resided in Banning and Riverside. Mr. Quimby was hired as a radio announcer for a brief period of time before being elected to the San Bernardino City Council in 1957. He was the youngest person to ever serve on that body.  In 1962, John Quimby was elected to the California State Assembly, representing parts of Riverside and San Bernardino counties. Mr. Quimby became the first paraplegic to serve in the California Legislature. He contracted polio at a young age and as a result spent the majority of his life in a wheelchair. Mr. Quimby did not allow his limited mobility to prevent him from pursuing his dreams and fighting fervently for the residents of California.  Over the course of his 12 years in the Assembly, John Quimby helped pass numerous laws. Most famously, he drafted the Quimby Act in 1965, which allowed cities to require developers to donate land for recreational use. As a result of this piece of legislation, hundreds of parks now exist in California that might otherwise have not.  Apart from being a dedicated assemblyman, John Quimby was also a beloved figure in California politics who thrived on personal and community interaction. He had the ability to make everyone feel special and cared for.  Please join me in expressing the sympathies of this body to John Quimby's brother Merle, daughter Kimberly, son John Jr., stepdaughters Mary and Virginia George, stepson Kenny, his seven grandchildren, and his seven great-grandchildren. On this day, we celebrate him, his life, and his exemplary contributions to California and the Nation.                          ____________________
