President, I have often remarked that the education of a Senator is a daunting task. Fortunately, the U.S. Senate is blessed with many talented staff who are dedicated to that challenge.  Among them is Ms. Teri Spoutz, a professional staff member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee for the past 5 years. To read through Teri's accomplishments is to understand how fortunate the Senate is to be able to attract some of the best talent in Washington, DC.  Teri grew up in southern California and began her career as a civilian at Los Angeles Air Force Base. As a financial manager, she served in a variety of positions overseeing major acquisitions of satellites and rockets for the Air Force.  Teri and her family then left sunny California for the cold, windswept plains of the missile fields at F.E. Warren Air Force Base, WY, as her husband, Stephen, pursued his promising career as an Air Force officer. The Spoutz family landed in Washington, DC, in 2003, and Teri continued her work in the Pentagon.  By 2008, Teri had been promoted to the Senior Executive Service as the Chief of Budget Investment for the Department of the Air Force. For nearly 3 years, Teri was the top financial overseer of all Air Force procurement, research and development, and military construction funding.  In March 2011, Teri was persuaded to join the staff of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee under the leadership of Chairman Daniel Inouye. Her expert knowledge of how the defense acquisition system works--and, too often, how it does not work--has resulted in many billions of dollars for our national defense being cut from underperforming programs and reinvested in more important ones.  As a staffer, she carried out in-depth reviews on the most important programs in the Pentagon's budget, including detailed annual examinations of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the largest weapons contract in the history of the Pentagon, and dozens of other large developmental and procurement programs.  But Teri has always held a special interest in space. On the Defense Subcommittee, she led investigations into bringing competition to space launch, which in just the last year has shown can cut the cost of rockets by half. She was also vital in stopping an effort to cut off access to rocket engines that are vital to our national security, which could have resulted in billions of additional costs to the U.S. taxpayer.  Teri is soon leaving the U.S. Senate. I thank her for her service on the Defense Subcommittee, commend her for all that she has accomplished, and wish her and her family all the best.                          ____________________
