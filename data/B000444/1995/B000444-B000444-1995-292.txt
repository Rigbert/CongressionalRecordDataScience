 President, I have been here a while. When I first got here 23 years ago, I learned a lesson from Russell Long.  I went up to him on a Finance Committee day and asked to have an amendment accepted, and he said yes. I proceeded to speak on it half an hour and say why it was a good amendment. And he said, ``I changed my mind. Rollcall vote.'' I lost. He came later and he said, ``When I accept an amendment, accept the amendment and sit down.''  I will take 30 seconds to explain my amendment because it is about to be accepted. I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for allowing me to move ahead. He is always gracious to me and I appreciate it.  There is a carve-out in this legislation, carving out securities fraud from the application of the civil RICO statutes. I think that is a bad idea. But I will not debate that issue tonight.  I have an amendment that is before the body that says such a carve-out exists, except that it shall not apply if any participant in fraud is criminally convicted; then RICO can apply, and the statute does not begin to toll until the day of the conviction becomes final.  Keeping with the admonition of Russell Long, I have no further comment on the amendment.  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, we have no objection. We accept that amendment.
