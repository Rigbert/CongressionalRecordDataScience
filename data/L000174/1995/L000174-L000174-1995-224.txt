President, as I noted earlier, I support the Cohen amendment. I wanted to doublecheck with a couple of people on this side. I appreciate the Senator from Maine and the Senator from Kentucky delaying action while we did that. That checking has been done.  I compliment the Senator from Maine on his amendment. It is acceptable on this side.
