President, those of us who are in the managing positions want to explain what it is about and why the cloture is very important. However, we do want to accommodate the Senator from Arizona, who is busy with a markup right now, and if there is no objection, I would recognize him for up to 8 minutes.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma and the Senator from Missouri for their courtesy, and I will try to be brief in my statement.  Nearly 50 years ago, the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 was enacted into law. As I mentioned during last year's debate, the 1956 act added up to a mere 29 pages--a tiny fraction of this year's highway bill. But what it accomplished truly changed this country. The act created programs that led to the construction of the Interstate Highway System, the largest civil works project ever undertaken by the United States. The 1956 act was the brainchild of President Eisenhower to establish the highway trust fund, financed by taxes on gasoline to fund this massive undertaking. The act required the construction of an interstate highway system using a uniform design that would be safer than most U.S. highways in existence at that time.  Mr. President, today we are all the beneficiaries of the foresight of President Eisenhower and of the Congress that helped to shepherd the legislation through to enactment. The Interstate System today is 47,000 miles long, comprised of 62 superhighways crisscrossing the Nation in a grid. Twenty-four percent of all travel occurs on the interstates, and the system has obtained a record of being twice as safe as other highways.  Unfortunately, when people look back 50 years from now at the highway legislation that the Senate will consider shortly, I doubt that history will remember this as having helped improve on President Eisenhower's ``grand plan.'' We are no longer focused on building a unified transportation system to improve the safety, security, and economy of our Nation as a whole. Instead, we are faced with legislation that redistributes funding to the States in an unfair manner.  Approximately every 6 years we reauthorize our Nation's multiyear highway, transit, and safety programs. We last reauthorized these programs in 1998 with the enactment of TEA-21 following extensive debate in the Senate. In the 108th Congress we did not reauthorize these programs, and, instead, Congress passed a series of short-term extensions of TEA-21, and this happened for good reason. The bill brought to the Senate floor in the last Congress would have increased overall funding to $318 billion, $100 billion over the TEA-21 enacted level.  I commend the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee for reducing the authorized number to match the President's fiscal 2006 budget proposal of $284 billion in the version of the bill reported by his committee. Reduction in the overall size of the bill was a significant improvement over the legislation presented to the Senate last year. Fiscal discipline is a key component of this debate. As Alan Greenspan warned some days ago, ``Under existing tax rates and reasonable assumptions about other spending, projections make clear that the Federal budget is on an unsustainable path in which large deficits result in rising interest rates and ever growing interest payments that augment deficits in future years.''  We need to control our spending. We must. And that is why the overall size of this bill should not be inflated. We are considering a substitute amendment to the bill that as proposed increases obligations by $11 billion, and I think that is wrong.  According to the Statement of Administration Policy regarding the highway bill, ``Should the obligation or net authorization levels that would result from the final bill exceed (that amount), the President's senior advisors will recommend that he veto the bill.''  Apparently, we are now going to test whether the President will veto the bill.  Fiscal prudence is crucial, but even if the conferees act sensibly and recognize the need for an agreement that would be acceptable to the President, that alone would not make the legislation adequate.  Equity is also crucial and, unfortunately, the highway bill that is before us retains unfair features of past bills. In some cases, it is even more unfair than last year's legislation. This year's highway bill perpetuates the historical discrepancy between donor States and donee States.  Remarkably, not only does the bill continue the disparity, it actually exacerbates it. Whereas the bill that was passed last year by the Senate would have increased theoretically every State's rate of return to 95 percent in the final year of the bill, the substitute amendment before the Senate only promises a rate of 92 percent in 2009 for those States. Until then many States would linger at a rate of return of 90.5 in the first year and 91 percent thereafter while others receive more--in some cases much more than what they contribute to the highway trust fund. As if that were not enough, this year's bill would actually propose to create further disparities between States. Although ``equity'' is in the title of the legislation, the number of donor States would increase from 28 under current law to 31. Under the Environment and Public Works Committee's so-called formula, which is less a formula than it is a series of calculations consisting of arbitrary funding caps and floors, some States would actually receive a greater rate of return than they would have under last year's bill, despite the fact that this year's overall funding is less. That is remarkable.  My colleagues may wonder how this is possible, and they may question my facts. But as hard as this may be to believe, it is true. For example, the State of Missouri, which currently receives a rate of return of 91 percent, would have received an increased rate of return of 95 percent immediately and then throughout the reauthorization. Under the substitute amendment before us, Missouri will go from a rate of return of 91 percent to 99 percent immediately.  Despite Missouri's good fortune, five States would continue to linger at the bottom of the barrel for 4 years. In the fifth year, at least theoretically, these States would increase their rates of return to 92 percent, a modest increase of 1.5 percent over current law; 1.5 percent when other States enjoy a rate of return of over 200 percent, in one case almost 530 percent, in that final year. They say that beggars can't be choosers, but this legislation shouldn't be passed solely to prove that point. States like Arizona, California, and Texas should not be in the position of begging for their fair share of contributions to the highway trust fund.  I fully recognize that during the years when the Federal Government was building the interstate system, a redistribution of funding between the States may have made sense. Clearly, it would have been very difficult for the State of Montana, for example, with fewer than a million people, to pay the full cost of building its share of the intestate system. But that era is over. Congress declared the construction of the interstate system complete in 1991. Yet here we are, almost 15 years later, and donor States are still expected to agree to the redistribution of hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars to other States regardless of the already enormous transportation needs of donor States.  Let me be clear. Today, the need is in the highest growth States, which face some of this Nation's toughest transportation challenges. According to the most recent Census Bureau projections, Florida, Texas, and Arizona, all super-donor States receiving the minimum rate of return, will be among the five fastest-growing States over the next 25 years. Yet the donee States, many with shrinking populations, continue to receive growing subsidies from donor States. Meanwhile, States like Florida, Texas, and Arizona, and others including Colorado and Indiana, would be held for no apparent reason at the bottom. Other States, including Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia also would continue to get shortchanged. This is not the right approach, it is unfair, and we should do everything we can to ensure that any bill voted off this floor is more equitable for all States.  Now, I am sure we will hear about the great transportation needs of the States that receive more funds than they contribute. And I have no doubt that those States do, in fact, have significant needs. But how was it determined that California, for example, should have an average of $260 million per year of its funding redistributed as the EPW-reported bill would direct? Why aren't California's transportation needs as worthy of receiving the same percentage of Federal funds as provided to meet the transportation needs of a State like New York, for example, which is scheduled to receive a rate of return of 111 percent, or an average of over $140 million per year more than it contributes. This significant rate of return isn't the product of savvy investment. It is a guaranteed rate of return well above 100 percent that is built on the backs of donor States.  Why should a State like Alaska receive a rate of return in 2009 of almost 530 percent when it currently already receives a return of 500 percent? Why should Montana receive a rate of return of almost 228 percent, or Vermont a rate of over 212 percent? These figures defy any reasonable explanation other than the following: This bill is less about the integrity of our Nation's transportation system than it is about maximizing the amount of money going to some States at the expense of others.  I support a long-term reauthorization of our Nation's surface transportation programs and I understand the vital nature of this funding to our States. But before we take action on this bill, I urge my colleagues to start asking questions and to take seriously the consequences of increasing the size of this bill beyond the $284 billion level and of perpetuating the inequitable distribution of funds under this legislation.
