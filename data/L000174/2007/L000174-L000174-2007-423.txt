President, I am pleased to introduce a joint resolution that would grant the consent of Congress to the International Emergency Management Assistance Memorandum of Understanding, IEMAMOU compact. This joint resolution would formally approve of the IEMAMOU compact, a mutual emergency assistance agreement entered into by the New England States, including my home State of Vermont and several Canadian Provinces, who are our neighbors to the north. This mutual assistance compact, which has been agreed to and operating in principle for more than 5 years, allows for cooperation between emergency responders in the United States and Canada during natural disasters and other serious emergencies. This compact is an extraordinary example of the international cooperation and good will which makes our countries more secure and our citizens safer. Congress should pass this joint resolution to give this vital compact the full force of law.  We must all do our best to prepare for the most serious emergencies that can harm our communities. These crises may arise from natural or manmade disasters, or from technological hazards or civil emergencies. As those who live in the Northeast know, extreme weather is not uncommon in New England, or in the eastern Provinces of Canada. Together with our Canadian neighbors, we have endured catastrophic blizzards and ice storms over the years that have closed roads and highways, shut down power for extended periods, and stranded travelers and rural residents for days, or longer. At times, we have also suffered the misfortune of responding to serious accidents, such as train or plane crashes. Of course, our concerns for safety surrounding nuclear powerplants and other industrial sites warrants extensive planning and preparedness for even the possibility of technological disasters. During these events, we turn to our first responders and our emergency management professionals to provide assistance and secure public safety no matter how grave the danger, and no matter how challenging the task.  The IEMMOU compact was created in response to the devastating ice storm of 1998. In January of that year, an unprecedented 3-day ice storm paralyzed portions of the northern New England States and the adjacent Canadian Provinces causing massive damage to the electrical and transportation infrastructure. Millions were left in the dark for days and even weeks, leaving more than 30 dead and shutting down normal activities in large cities like Montreal and Ottawa. Following this devastation, the governors and premiers of those regions affected recognized the need for greater cross-border emergency cooperation, and they directed their emergency management leaders to develop and create a memorandum of understanding on these issues that benefit all parties north and south of the border. The IEMAMOU compact was the result of this collaborative, international process, and now stands as a model compact for cross-border mutual emergency assistance.  The compact allows for international sharing of resources and expertise in times of extreme emergency or disaster. For example, rural States, such as my own, may need to call upon specialized resources found in other larger States or neighboring Provinces to respond immediately to events, such as chemical disasters or mass transit accidents. With natural disasters, such as prolonged, severe winter storms, the areas affected may be so vast, stretching across several States or Provinces that no single jurisdiction alone could respond fully to the crisis. There are also events that occur along or near our border with Canada which require the immediate response and full cooperation of States and Provinces in both nations. The IEMAMOU compact meets these needs with a thoughtful and forward-looking outline of how to address issues that face first responders and their managers in times of cross-border emergency.  This international compact provides a legal framework for cooperation and mutual assistance between the States of Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, and the Canadian Provinces of Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador. The compact requires each participating member, whether State or Province, to formulate plans and programs to facilitate international and interstate or provincial cooperation in case of natural or manmade disaster, technological hazard, or civil emergency. The compact also provides for the temporary suspension of statutes or ordinances in each jurisdiction that may impede the implementation of these plans. For example, under the compact, government officials and law enforcement authorities from one member State or Province can officially work in other jurisdictions during times of emergency, a circumstance that would not be permitted otherwise.  The compact also creates a formal mechanism for making assistance requests from one state or province to another, and encourages frequent consultation between the emergency management leaders to develop free exchange of information and resources across borders. In addition, the compact provides a Good Samaritan provision, which gives liability protection for emergency responders who act in good faith in providing assistance in a legal jurisdiction outside their own, and creates reciprocal workers compensation and other benefits to emergency responders who may get injured in responding to an emergency under the compact. Finally, the compact allows for reimbursement between members States or Provinces for losses or damages incurred in responding under the agreement.  All members of this compact have agreed to its terms and join in requesting Congress's consent for the agreement. Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut have joined the IEMAMOU compact, and many of these States have passed legislation adopting the compact under State law. The Premiers of Quebec, Prince Edward Island, Labrador, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick have similarly approved of thecompact. The IEMAMOU compact has been functioning in principle for more than 5 years, as the emergency management leaders from each member State and Province meet twice a year. Planning among the constituent members of the compact is also ongoing. This compact works well and should be supported by Congress.  The IEMAMOU compact is an international agreement between States and a foreign power, and it cannot have the full force of law without the formal approval of Congress. The U.S. Constitution requires that ``[n]o state shall . . . enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power'' unless with the ``consent of Congress.'' U.S. Const. Art. 1, Sec.  10, cl. 3. The joint resolution introduced today provides this necessary consent, and would give legal force to the compact. Congressional approval of this compact would also provide jurisdiction for Federal courts to resolve any disputes under the agreement.  This joint resolution is vitally important to the New England States and our Canadian Provinces to the north. Congress should support their cooperative, international leadership in creating and implementing this unique emergency management compact. The Governor of Vermont supports this joint resolution as do the leaders of the North East States Emergency Consortium, which represents each of the New England States in the compact.  This is not the first time I have supported this joint resolution. In 2001, this joint resolution was introduced by my colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Robert Smith, and I joined him as a cosponsor along with Senators Lieberman, Jeffords, Chafee, and Gregg. As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I moved the joint resolution through Committee where it passed by unanimous consent on October 31, 2001. With my support and that of other Senators, the joint resolution passed the Senate by unanimous consent on December 20, 2001, in the last month of the Democratic majority in the 107 Congress. Unfortunately, the House never came to consider the joint resolution, and it failed to become law. Since then, under the Republican leadership of the 108 and 109 Congresses, the joint resolution has only been introduced once and has not moved beyond referral to committee.  It is time to take action and pass this joint resolution without further delay. The IEMAMOU compact provides invaluable international cooperation and mutual assistance in times of natural disaster and extreme emergency. This compact works well for New England and the eastern Canadian provinces, and it stands as a model for emergency management planning and cooperation across this country. It is a crucial element of the security and safety planning for all communities in New England and eastern Canada, and we can wait no longer for it to become law.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                              S.J. Res. 13       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the      United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. CONGRESSIONAL CONSENT.       Congress consents to the International Emergency Management      Assistance Memorandum of Understanding entered into between      the States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts,      Rhode Island, and Connecticut and the Provinces of Quebec,      New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and      Newfoundland. The compact is substantially as follows:     ``ARTICLE I--INTERNATIONAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE                    MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING PURPOSE AND                    AUTHORITIES       ``The International Emergency Management Assistance      Memorandum of Understanding, hereinafter referred to as the      `compact,' is made and entered into by and among such of the      jurisdictions as shall enact or adopt this compact,      hereinafter referred to as `party jurisdictions.' For the      purposes of this agreement, the term `jurisdictions' may      include any or all of the States of Maine, New Hampshire,      Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut and the      Provinces of Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island,      Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, and such other states and      provinces as may hereafter become a party to this compact.       ``The purpose of this compact is to provide for the      possibility of mutual assistance among the jurisdictions      entering into this compact in managing any emergency or      disaster when the affected jurisdiction or jurisdictions ask      for assistance, whether arising from natural disaster,      technological hazard, manmade disaster or civil emergency      aspects of resources shortages.       ``This compact also provides for the process of planning      mechanisms among the agencies responsible and for mutual      cooperation, including, if need be, emergency-related      exercises, testing, or other training activities using      equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect      of the giving and receiving of aid by party jurisdictions or      subdivisions of party jurisdictions during emergencies, with      such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency      periods. Mutual assistance in this compact may include the      use of emergency forces by mutual agreement among party      jurisdictions.     ``ARTICLE II--GENERAL IMPLEMENTATION       ``Each party jurisdiction entering into this compact      recognizes that many emergencies may exceed the capabilities      of a party jurisdiction and that intergovernmental      cooperation is essential in such circumstances. Each      jurisdiction further recognizes that there will be      emergencies that may require immediate access and present      procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and      effective response to such an emergency because few, if any,      individual jurisdictions have all the resources they need in      all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering      resources to areas where emergencies exist.       ``The prompt, full, and effective utilization of resources      of the participating jurisdictions, including any resources      on hand or available from any other source that are essential      to the safety, care, and welfare of the people in the event      of any emergency or disaster, shall be the underlying      principle on which all articles of this compact are      understood.       ``On behalf of the party jurisdictions participating in the      compact, the legally designated official who is assigned      responsibility for emergency management is responsible for      formulation of the appropriate inter-jurisdictional mutual      aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact,      and for recommendations to the jurisdiction concerned with      respect to the amendment of any statutes, regulations, or      ordinances required for that purpose.     ``ARTICLE III--PARTY JURISDICTION RESPONSIBILITIES       ``(a) Formulate Plans and Programs.--It is the      responsibility of each party jurisdiction to formulate      procedural plans and programs for inter-jurisdictional      cooperation in the performance of the responsibilities listed      in this section. In formulating and implementing such plans      and programs the party jurisdictions, to the extent      practical, shall--       ``(1) review individual jurisdiction hazards analyses that      are available and, to the extent reasonably possible,      determine all those potential emergencies the party      jurisdictions might jointly suffer, whether due to natural      disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster or      emergency aspects of resource shortages;       ``(2) initiate a process to review party jurisdictions'      individual emergency plans and develop a plan that will      determine the mechanism for the inter-jurisdictional      cooperation;       ``(3) develop inter-jurisdictional procedures to fill any      identified gaps and to resolve any identified inconsistencies      or overlaps in existing or developed plans;       ``(4) assist in warning communities adjacent to or crossing      jurisdictional boundaries;       ``(5) protect and ensure delivery of services, medicines,      water, food, energy and fuel, search and rescue, and critical      lifeline equipment, services and resources, both human and      material to the extent authorized by law;       ``(6) inventory and agree upon procedures for the inter-     jurisdictional loan and delivery of human and material      resources, together with procedures for reimbursement or      forgiveness; and       ``(7) provide, to the extent authorized by law, for      temporary suspension of any statutes or ordinances, over      which the province or state has jurisdiction, that impede the      implementation of the responsibilities described in this      subsection.       ``(b) Request Assistance.--The authorized representative of      a party jurisdiction may request assistance of another party      jurisdiction by contacting the authorized representative of      that jurisdiction. These provisions only apply to requests      for assistance made by and to authorized representatives.      Requests may be verbal or in writing. If verbal, the request      must be confirmed in writing within 15 days of the verbal      request. Requests must provide the following information:       ``(1) A description of the emergency service function for      which assistance is needed and of the mission or missions,      including but not limited to fire services, emergency      medical, transportation, communications, public works and      engineering, building inspection, planning and information      assistance, mass care, resource support, health and medical      services, and search and rescue.       ``(2) The amount and type of personnel, equipment,      materials, and supplies needed and a reasonable estimate of      the length of time they will be needed.       ``(3) The specific place and time for staging of the      assisting party's response and a point of contact at the      location.       ``(c) Consultation Among Party Jurisdiction Officials.--     There shall be frequent consultation among the party      jurisdiction officials who have assigned emergency management      responsibilities, such officials collectively known      hereinafter as the International Emergency Management Group,      and other appropriate representatives of the party      jurisdictions with free exchange of information, plans, and      resource records relating to emergency capabilities to the      extent authorized by law.     ``ARTICLE IV--LIMITATION       ``Any party jurisdiction requested to render mutual aid or      conduct exercises and training for mutual aid shall undertake      to respond as soon as possible, except that it is understood      that the jurisdiction rendering aid may withhold or recall      resources to the extent necessary to provide reasonable      protection for that jurisdiction. Each party jurisdiction      shall afford to the personnel of the emergency forces of any      party jurisdiction, while operating within its jurisdictional      limits under the terms and conditions of this compact and      under the operational control of an officer of the requesting      party, the same powers, duties, rights, privileges, and      immunities as are afforded similar or like forces of the      jurisdiction in which they are performing emergency services.      Emergency forces continue under the command and control of      their regular leaders, but the organizational units come      under the operational control of the emergency services      authorities of the jurisdiction receiving assistance. These      conditions may be activated, as needed, by the jurisdiction      that is to receive assistance or upon commencement of      exercises or training for mutual aid and continue as long as      the exercises or training for mutual aid are in progress, the      emergency or disaster remains in effect or loaned resources      remain in the receiving jurisdiction or jurisdictions,      whichever is longer. The receiving jurisdiction is      responsible for informing the assisting jurisdictions of the      specific moment when services will no longer be required.     ``ARTICLE V--LICENSES AND PERMITS       ``Whenever a person holds a license, certificate, or other      permit issued by any jurisdiction party to the compact      evidencing the meeting of qualifications for professional,      mechanical, or other skills, and when such assistance is      requested by the receiving party jurisdiction, such person is      deemed to be licensed, certified, or permitted by the      jurisdiction requesting assistance to render aid involving      such skill to meet an emergency or disaster, subject to such      limitations and conditions as the requesting jurisdiction      prescribes by Executive order or otherwise.     ``ARTICLE VI--LIABILITY       ``Any person or entity of a party jurisdiction rendering      aid in another jurisdiction pursuant to this compact are      considered agents of the requesting jurisdiction for tort      liability and immunity purposes. Any person or entity      rendering aid in another jurisdiction pursuant to this      compact are not liable on account of any act or omission in      good faith on the part of such forces while so engaged or on      account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or      supplies in connection therewith. Good faith in this article      does not include willful misconduct, gross negligence, or      recklessness.     ``ARTICLE VII--SUPPLEMENTARY AGREEMENTS       ``Because it is probable that the pattern and detail of the      machinery for mutual aid among 2 or more jurisdictions may      differ from that among the jurisdictions that are party to      this compact, this compact contains elements of a broad base      common to all jurisdictions, and nothing in this compact      precludes any jurisdiction from entering into supplementary      agreements with another jurisdiction or affects any other      agreements already in force among jurisdictions.      Supplementary agreements may include, but are not limited to,      provisions for evacuation and reception of injured and other      persons and the exchange of medical, fire, public utility,      reconnaissance, welfare, transportation and communications      personnel, equipment, and supplies.     ``ARTICLE VIII--WORKERS' COMPENSATION AND DEATH BENEFITS       ``Each party jurisdiction shall provide, in accordance with      its own laws, for the payment of workers' compensation and      death benefits to injured members of the emergency forces of      that jurisdiction and to representatives of deceased members      of those forces if the members sustain injuries or are killed      while rendering aid pursuant to this compact, in the same      manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were      sustained within their own jurisdiction.     ``ARTICLE IX--REIMBURSEMENT       ``Any party jurisdiction rendering aid in another      jurisdiction pursuant to this compact shall, if requested, be      reimbursed by the party jurisdiction receiving such aid for      any loss or damage to, or expense incurred in, the operation      of any equipment and the provision of any service in      answering a request for aid and for the costs incurred in      connection with those requests. An aiding party jurisdiction      may assume in whole or in part any such loss, damage,      expense, or other cost or may loan such equipment or donate      such services to the receiving party jurisdiction without      charge or cost. Any 2 or more party jurisdictions may enter      into supplementary agreements establishing a different      allocation of costs among those jurisdictions. Expenses under      article VIII are not reimbursable under this section.     ``ARTICLE X--EVACUATION       ``Each party jurisdiction shall initiate a process to      prepare and maintain plans to facilitate the movement of and      reception of evacuees into its territory or across its      territory, according to its capabilities and powers. The      party jurisdiction from which the evacuees came shall assume      the ultimate responsibility for the support of the evacuees,      and after the termination of the emergency or disaster, for      the repatriation of such evacuees.     ``ARTICLE XI--IMPLEMENTATION       ``(a) This compact is effective upon its execution or      adoption by any 2 jurisdictions, and is effective as to any      other jurisdiction upon its execution or adoption thereby:      subject to approval or authorization by the United States      Congress, if required, and subject to enactment of provincial      or State legislation that may be required for the      effectiveness of the Memorandum of Understanding.       ``(b) Any party jurisdiction may withdraw from this      compact, but the withdrawal does not take effect until 30      days after the governor or premier of the withdrawing      jurisdiction has given notice in writing of such withdrawal      to the governors or premiers of all other party      jurisdictions. The action does not relieve the withdrawing      jurisdiction from obligations assumed under this compact      prior to the effective date of withdrawal.       ``(c) Duly authenticated copies of this compact in the      French and English languages and of such supplementary      agreements as may be entered into shall, at the time of their      approval, be deposited with each of the party jurisdictions.     ``ARTICLE XII--SEVERABILITY       ``This compact is construed to effectuate the purposes      stated in Article I. If any provision of this compact is      declared unconstitutional or the applicability of the compact      to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the validity      of the remainder of this compact and the applicability of the      compact to other persons and circumstances are not affected.     ``ARTICLE XIII--CONSISTENCY OF LANGUAGE       ``The validity of the arrangements and agreements consented      to in this compact shall not be affected by any insubstantial      difference in form or language as may be adopted by the      various states and provinces.     ``ARTICLE XIV--AMENDMENT       ``This compact may be amended by agreement of the party      jurisdictions.''.
