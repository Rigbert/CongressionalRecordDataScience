Chairman, the gentleman who preceded me talked about the threats to the population if we do not have this practice. It has not happened in my State. We banned this practice.  Real sportsmen do not bait bears. In Oregon, what has happened is actually three times as many people have bought hunting licenses to hunt bears. So, actually, the bear harvest, if Members want to call it that, is up in Oregon because real hunters are out there, not the guys sitting around waiting for the bears to come and feast on what they are being baited with.
