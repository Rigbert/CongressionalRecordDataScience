 President, I support the comments of my colleague on the Presidio. I have lived all my life one block from the Presidio. I know it well. The Presidio bill is predicated on something that is unique. It is a private-public partnership whereby the more than 500 historic buildings and the additional buildings would be leased out, with a hope that over a 15-year-period it would be able to make public areas of the Presidio self-supporting.  Having said this, I am hopeful that every Member of this body could realize the longer it takes to get a bill, the more in jeopardy that plan becomes. Because of the rains, because of the fact that many of these buildings are now boarded up, they are subject to intrusion, to vandalism; they are subject to the absence of an adequate policing authority on that 1,500-acre post. The Presidio, by each day of delay, is placed in jeopardy.  I am also hopeful, and I address these remarks to the distinguished majority leader, that he would be willing to become a party to negotiations which I think can go on, on the subject of the Utah wilderness, so that we might be able to get an agreement that would be satisfactory to the two Senators from Utah, as well. I think it is possible. I think that every area is not the same as Yellowstone or Yosemite. They have certain unique characteristics which need to have attention, as well.  I am hopeful, Mr. Leader, that in the ensuing days, perhaps under your auspice, there might be negotiations which could be carried out. At least we should try and see if we cannot get some agreement which can either enable the package to move ahead as a package, or enable the Presidio, something which my colleague just said, does have unanimous consent in this body, to move ahead.
