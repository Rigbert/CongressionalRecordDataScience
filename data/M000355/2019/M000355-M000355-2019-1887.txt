 President, I ask unanimous consent that all postcloture time on the Bade nomination expire at 2:15 p.m. tomorrow; further, that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action. I further ask that following the disposition of the Bade nomination, the Senate proceed to legislative session and resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S.J. Res. 88, with the time until 4 p.m. equally divided between the two leaders or their designees; finally, notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, that the cloture motions with respect to the motions to proceed to S.J. Res. 8 and H.R. 268 ripen at 4 p.m. tomorrow.
