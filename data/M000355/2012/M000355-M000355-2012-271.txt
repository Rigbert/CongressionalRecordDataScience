 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a group of individuals who have been working to make a difference in the lives of local veterans in their community for over 60 years. The honor guard of Frankfort, Kentucky's Veterans of Foreign Wars Office Post 4075 has been providing an official military funeral ceremony for local veterans in the central Kentucky area since the 1950s.  Veterans K.B. Johns, Ralph Spooner, Bill Hampton, and Charlie Mauer founded the first VFW Post 4075 color guard over 60 years ago. The men worked together to increase the size of the color guard over the next decade into a full honor guard with 11 members: 2 flag folders, 7 riflemen, 1 bugler, and 1 leader. The honor guard takes any and all requests to play at a fellow serviceman's funeral, free of charge.  The honor guard is made up of veterans from World War II, the Vietnam war, the Korean war, Operation Desert Storm, and Operation Iraqi Freedom. They may be from different generations, but they all share the same respect for one another. Charlie Mauer is the only surviving original member of the troop; he is 85 years old.  Mr. Mauer is joined by three other World War II veterans: Mr. Burnett Napier fought with the U.S. Marines in the Battle of Peleliu in the Pacific Theater at the age of 19. He is now 87 years old, and he is the recipient of the Purple Heart and the Silver Star, two of the highest honors awarded by the U.S. military. Mr. Charlie Hinds, who is 88 years old, served as a scout for GEN George Patton for 2 years. He enlisted in the Army at age 18. The youngest of the WWII veterans at age 84 is Jim Wolcott. He was stationed in Europe from 1944 to 1947.  According to Charlie Mauer, the honor guard is ``a great bunch of guys.'' The men have conducted ceremonies for hundreds of funerals throughout the program's lifetime and expected nothing in return. They are driven by compassion for their fellow servicemen who have gone on and their families who are left behind with only the memories of their loved one. The men are honored to get the chance to pay tribute to Frankfort veterans who have passed away. When asked, all of the men say that they plan to stay involved in the honor guard as long as they are able to.  It is inspiring to witness others who truly receive joy and satisfaction from helping their fellow man. The men of Frankfort's VFW Post 4075 honor guard will sometimes perform at as many as three funerals a day, all for free. These men have all been involved in historic battles throughout our Nation's history, and they have served their country valiantly. And although they have already given so much, they are still far from done giving back to their community, State, and country.  Mr. President, at this time I ask that my fellow colleagues in the Senate join me in recognizing the valiant dedication to service shown by these brave individuals. There was recently an article published in the Lexington Herald-Leader that featured Frankfort's Veterans of Foreign Wars Office Post 4075. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:           [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, Mar. 26, 2012]      Frankfort VFW's Honor Guard Members Feel Privileged To Serve                        (By Kayleigh Zyskowski)       When the phone rings at the Frankfort Veterans of Foreign      Wars Post on Second Street, 85-year-old Charlie Mauer answers      it.       On the other end is not a question about the day's soups or      the next bingo night, but a request for the VFW Post 4075      honor guard to pay final respects to a fellow veteran.       It's a call Mauer, honor guard commander, has been      answering for years, and he's honored to take it.       K.B. Johns, Ralph Spooner, Bill Hampton and Mauer the only      living original member founded the first VFW Post 4075 color      guard in the early 1950s.       Within the next decade they were able to support a full      honor guard, which takes at least 11 members: two flag      folders, seven riflemen, one bugler and one leader.       Four of the current members are World War II veterans, and      the rest served in Vietnam, Korea, Desert Storm and Operation      Iraqi Freedom. They are from different generations, but the      men say they share the same respect for each other.       ``We've got a good bunch of guys,'' Mauer said.       Mauer, a World War II veteran, says serving the community      and paying tribute to Frankfort veterans is something he's      glad to do. And because he grew up in Frankfort, he knows      many of those who've died, which makes the job more important      to him.       Several days after the call comes in, Mauer arrives at the      post ready to greet the other members and prepare the      equipment.       ``We don't get paid,'' says World War II veteran Jim      Wolcott, ``other than a free lunch and a beer.''       The men arrive wearing dark-blue uniforms decorated with      gold cords, white gloves and polished black shoes.       They shuffle into the game room of the VFW where the rifles      are stored in a locked cabinet.       After they are prepared to leave for the funeral service,      the group stands in the doorway teasing each other about      their weight and asking the kitchen crew what's for lunch.       There's no need for practice or rehearsal; each man knows      his role because the group has done it so often.       The group has attended as many as three funerals in one      day, Mauer says, but the number is usually several per month.      Over the years, they have provided services for hundreds of      funerals.       The men have braved every kind of weather for funerals, and      this morning is chilly and rainy. Luckily, they've heard the      sky will clear before the service starts.       The 11 men divide into separate vehicles and make their way      up East Main Street to Frankfort Cemetery.       As they wait for the family to arrive at the cemetery's      chapel, Charlie Hinds asks Burnett Napier, ``What are you      doing lately?''       ``As little as possible,'' Napier jokes.       Both Napier and Hinds are World War II combat veterans--     Napier in the Marines and Hinds in the Army.       By 19, Napier was fighting in one of the Marine's deadliest      battles in the Pacific on Peleliu Island with the 1st Marine      Division.       It was September 1944 when Napier ended up on the coral      island fighting against the Empire of Japan. He was a      corpsman, or medic, when he ran to the side of a fallen      Marine, performed first aid on the man under machine-gun fire      before carrying him to safety.       Shrapnel hit him later in the same battle, and he suffered      a concussion.       Napier, an honor guard member for 15 years, received the      Purple Heart and the Silver Star while in combat on the      island, which is present day Palau Islands.       ``They didn't stay in one place for too long. I was all      over the Pacific,'' he said.       ``According to the citation, a Marine was caught in      crossfire with machine guns, and, according to the citation,      I administered first aid under fire and carried him back to      relative safety,'' Napier said.       Charlie Hinds, 88, has been a member of the honor guard for      about 16 years.       He served in seven campaigns and was an Army scout for      General George Patton for two years.       ``He wasn't a really nice guy; he wouldn't ever come up and      want to know about you personally,'' Hinds said about Patton.      ``He just wanted to tell you what to do, but he was a good      general.''       Hinds and his brother enlisted after graduating from high      school because his father didn't have enough money to send      him to school. He was 18 years old.       ``With about two weeks left in the war, I was the only      (one) left in my platoon,'' Hinds said.       Family members of the deceased begin to arrive at Frankfort      Cemetery. Vince LaFontaine--who has played in hundreds of      Frankfort funerals since he was a teenager--warms up with      scales, and the men take their positions.       The weather predictions were correct. The sky clears, the      sun comes out and the air warms in time for the ceremony to      begin.       Mauer stands in the doorway of the cemetery chapel where      about 15 members of the deceased veteran's family sits. He      signals the riflemen after the flag is precisely folded.       ``Ten-hut,'' he says sternly.       The seven riflemen fire three shots that echo over the      cliff and around South Frankfort before silence takes over,      and the bugler plays ``Taps.''       ``I've heard Taps' over a thousand times it seems, but it's      always emotional for me,'' Wolcott says back at the VFW over      a lunch of beef stew and corn bread.       Mauer says he never gets used to hearing ``Taps'' played,      either.       ``There's something about Taps'; it hits an emotion you      can't really describe,'' he says.       Wolcott, who at 84 takes claim as the youngest of the four      honor guard World War II veterans, was stationed in Europe      from 1944 to 1947.       The four men sit at the circular table over lunch for about      an hour before they decide they need to get home. They agree      their health will decide when it's time to hang up their      duties with the honor guard.       ``When you become our age you don't look ahead too far,''      Napier said.       ``We go day by day, but we'll be here as long as we can.''                          ____________________
