 If you talk to the people of this country, if you talk to the veterans and say: Do you want VAhealth care to be privatized? Overwhelmingly, no.  In recent years, the Senator from Ohio, I, and others, have worked to substantially increase funding for federally qualified community health care centers all over this country. These are the most cost-effective ways of providing quality health care, dental care, low-cost prescription drugs, mental health counseling.  The people of this country want those. I hope we have success in expanding that program. But I get a little bit tired of hearing from some of our friends on the other side who tell us: Oh, people do not want government involved in health care. Well, you tell that to seniors. Tell them you want to privatize Medicare. Tell that to the veterans, that you want to privatize the VA.  The fact is, as the Senator from Ohio indicated, we are wasting tens and tens of billions of dollars every year in bureaucracy, in billing, in excessive CEO salaries through private health insurance companies. At the very least, the people of this country are demanding, and we must bring forth, a strong--underline ``strong''--public option within any health care reform program we develop.
