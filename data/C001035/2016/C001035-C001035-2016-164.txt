President, today I wish to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the town of Kingfield, ME. Known today as a gateway to the rugged and beautiful Longfellow Mountains, Kingfield was built with a spirit of determination and resiliency that still guides the community today.  Kingfield's incorporation on January 24, 1816, was but one milestone on a long journey of progress. For thousands of years, the mountains and river valleys of western Maine were the hunting grounds of the Abenaki Tribe. The reverence the Abenaki had for the natural beauty and resources of the region is upheld by the people of Kingfield today.  The town's namesake is a central figure in Maine history. In 1807, merchant and shipbuilder William King and his partners purchased lands in the wilderness and began attracting settlers. In 1820, Maine achieved statehood, and William King, by then a respected statesman and decorated military officer, became its first Governor.  The early settlers were drawn by fertile soil, vast forests, and fast-moving waters, which they turned into productive farms and busy mills. Roads and a railway were built, and the wealth produced by hard work and determination was invested in schools and churches to create a true community.  Among the earliest settlers was Salomon Stanley, whose descendants became the business, social, and religious leaders of the town. At the dawn of the 20th century, his twin sons Francis Edgar and Freelan Oscar invented the groundbreaking Stanley Steamer automobile and were renowned violin makers. Along with their sister, Chansonetta, they introduced many technological and artistic advancements to the growing field of photography. The Stanley Museum, located in a beautiful century-old Georgian schoolhouse, celebrates the genius of a remarkable family.  When industry in Kingfield began to decline in the 1950s, outdoor recreation rose to prominence, driven by the energy, enthusiasm, and vision of the townspeople. Today skiing at Sugarloaf Mountain Resort, hiking, golf, and snowmobiling, along with some of the most spectacular scenery of the Appalachian Trail, place Kingfield among America's favorite destinations for the outdoor enthusiast. The decision by Nestle's Poland Spring to open a bottling plant in the town is a testament to the region's pristine environment and diversifying economy.  From the valiant service of Colonel William King in the War of 1812 to the conflicts of our time, Kingfield is a town of patriots. It is significant that the town's plans for its yearlong bicentennial celebration include enhancements to the memorials honoring Kingfield veterans.  Kingfield is also a town of involved citizens. The active historical society, volunteer fire department, and library are evidence of a strong community spirit. The planning and volunteerism that have gone into the bicentennial festivities are evidence that Kingfield's spirit only grows stronger.  This 200th anniversary is not just about something that is measured in calendar years; it is about human accomplishment and an occasion to celebrate the people who, for more than two centuries, have worked together and cared for one another. Thanks to those who came before, Kingfield has a wonderful past. Thanks to those who are there today, Kingfield has a bright future.                          ____________________
