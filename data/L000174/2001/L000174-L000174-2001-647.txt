I have often said how much I enjoyed being on the Senate Judiciary Committee. One of the reasons is that the Senator from New York serves there.  It is a committee where we often have spirited debates. We usually debate the most interesting issues before the Senate, but I rely more and more on the Senator from New York to boil down the essence of the arguments and to lead that debate.  I am sorry the Senator from Utah is not on the floor at the moment, but the Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, and I worked very hard to put together a hearing where both sides could be heard. I believe we did that. In fact, unlike the usual practice here, both sides had the same number of witnesses. If I recall, in this case, the minority side, the Republican side, actually had one more witness. But we tried to make sure that anybody who could add anything to the debate and should be heard was heard.  Even during the hearings, we actually had people who were added at the last minute at the request of Senator Hatch. He showed unfailing courtesy throughout all that, and I thank him for that.  I see the Senator from Indiana in the Chamber. I ask unanimous consent that the following editorials and materials with regard to the Ashcroft nomination be printed in the Record:  A column by Steve Neal from the Chicago Sun-Times of January 31, 2001;  An editorial from the Christian Science Monitor of today, February 1, 2001;  An editorial from the Rutland Daily Herald of January 24, 2001;  A column by Stuart Taylor from National Journal of January 13, 2001;  A column by Stuart Taylor from National Journal of October 10, 1999; and  An op-ed by Benjamin Wittes from Washington Post of October 13, 1999.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           [From The Christian Science Monitor, Feb. 1, 2001]                         Ashcroft's Tough Tasks       President Bush asked the Senate to look into the hearts of      each of his cabinet nominees. Through careful, albeit      contentious, hearings for his nominee for attorney general,      John Ashcroft, the Senate tried to do just that.       In those hearings, Americans got a first, strong taste of      the rancor that can occur when the Senate, and the country,      is split right down the middle on social issues. The      controversy over Mr. Ashcroft's nomination broke along      clearly partisan lines.       Ashcroft may now be confirmed by the Senate, but the      Democrats have fired a warning shot over the Bush ship of      state. Their message: Expect more battles over conservative      legal appointments--to the Supreme Court or elsewhere.       Ashcroft's deeply conservative views on abortion, civil      rights, and guns were subjected to extraordinarily close      scrutiny by     Democrats and liberal groups. Still, his critics were left      unsatisfied.       Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the Judiciary Committee's      ranking Democrat, summarized much of the concern over Mr.      Ashcroft's candor when he spoke on the Senate floor this      week: ``Most of us in this body have known the old John      Ashcroft. During the hearings, we met a new John Ashcroft.      Were the demurrals of his testimony real, or were they      delicate bubbles that could burst and evaporate a year or a      month or a day from now under the reassertion of his long-     held beliefs?''       The core issue is whether, as attorney general, Ashcroft      will put his own ideology above the law.       Supporters, such as Sen. Chuck Grassley (R) of Iowa, say      Ashcroft has demonstrated the integrity to maintain his ``by-     the-book approach to governing'' as he goes about cleaning up      a Justice Department he and others feel has lacked integrity.       The new attorney general's adherence to that standard will      be closely watched. As he promised the committee, he'll have      to ``vigorously'' uphold the laws of the land whether he      personally agrees with them or not--including the Supreme      Court's decision legalizing abortion, Roe v. Wade, which      Ashcroft acknowledged as ``settled law.''       Testimony regarding Ashcroft's opposition to the      appointment of a black Missouri judge to the federal bench      was particularly disturbing. The judge, Ronnie White, said      then-Senator Ashcroft distorted his record, calling him      ``pro-criminal,'' based on his interpretation of a few of      Judge White's written decisions.       Even if Ashcroft's motives at the time were political, not      racial, the episode leaves doubts about his judgment among      African-Americans and others.       Ashcroft will have to work especially hard to surmount both      his critics and some elements of his own record, and to prove      to the country that he will be, as Senator Leahy said, an      attorney general ``for all the people.''                                  ____              [From the Chicago Sun-Times, Jan. 31, 2001]                      Some More Equal Than Others                            (By Steve Neal)       The attorney general is supposed to represent all of us.       That's what is so troubling about John Ashcroft's      nomination to be the chief law enforcement officer of this      country.       Some of our more distinguished attorneys general served in      Republican administrations. Edward Levi restored integrity in      the Justice Department after Watergate. Elliot Richardson      showed great principle in resigning when Richard M. Nixon      ordered him to fire the special prosecutor investigating      Nixon's role in the scandal that brought down his presidency.      Herbert Brownell drafted the first civil rights law since      Reconstruction and recommended the use of federal troops when      the governor of Arkansas sought to block integration of      Central High School in Little Rock.       Each of these three men was committed to equal justice      under the law. Ashcroft doesn't meet that standard. Though he      is a person of ability and intelligence, his public record is      one of unfairness, intolerance and exclusion.       His role in sinking the nomination of Missouri Supreme      Court Justice Ronnie White for the federal bench was      disgraceful. Ashcroft twisted and distorted White's judicial      record. The Judiciary Committee, which had a GOP majority at      the time of White's nomination, recommended his confirmation.      Then Ashcroft waged a mean-spirited crusade that destroyed      White's chances. He was dishonest in labeling White's      judicial philosophy as ``pro-criminal'' and claiming that he      had ``a tremendous bent toward criminal activity.'' There is      no evidence that Ashcroft went after the African-American      judge because of his race. It is more likely that he attacked      White as part of his re-election strategy.       Ashcroft's record on civil rights, though, is alarming. As      governor and attorney general of Missouri, he bitterly      opposed court-ordered school desegregation in Kansas City and      St. Louis. More than two decades after the Brown vs. Board of      Education ruling made equal access to public education the      law, Ashcroft still was making the argument that it was      better to have segregated schools. As a candidate for      statewide office, he fanned racial tensions with his shrill      attacks on school integration. He didn't seem to care that      African-American youngsters were being denied an equal      education.       As governor of Missouri, he vetoed legislation that would      have boosted voter registration in minority communities. He      claimed that the proposed law would have led to voter fraud.      If he is confirmed as the next attorney general, he would      have responsibility for enforcing the Voting Rights Act.       During his Senate testimony, Ashcroft said that he would      not attempt to undermine Roe vs. Wade, the Supreme Court      decision that upheld a woman's legal right to have an      abortion. But he has spent his entire public career trying to      outlaw abortions or make them impossible to obtain. He is      opposed to abortion even in cases of rape or incest.       ``Both now and in my first term as [Missouri] attorney      general,'' he told the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee in      1981, ``I have devoted considerable time and significant      resources to defending the right of the state to limit the      dangerous impacts of Roe vs. Wade, a case in which a handful      of men on the Supreme Court arbitrarily amended the      Constitution and overturned the laws of the states related to      abortions.'' Ashcroft has previously referred to the Roe      decision as ``error-ridden.'' Most Americans disagree with      that viewpoint.       In his written response to the Judiciary committee, he      vowed not to re-fight these battles because the issue had      been settled ``through the passage of time and reaffirmation      by the Supreme Court.'' But he never has stopped trying to      reverse this landmark decision.       Ashcroft was misguided in his assault on the nomination of      the openly gay James C. Hormel to be ambassador to      Luxembourg. ``Based on the totality of Mr. Hormel's record of      public positions and advocacy, I did not believe he would      effectively represent the United States in Luxembourg, the      most Roman Catholic country in all of Europe,'' he said in      1998.       Based on the totality of Mr. Ashcroft's record, he is less      than committed to equal protection under the law. This cold-     hearted man is unfit to be the people's lawyer.                                  ____             [From the Rutland Daily Herald, Jan. 24, 2001]                             No to Ashcroft       Democrats should not be shy about voting against John      Ashcroft when his nomination for attorney general comes      before the Senate Judiciary Committee and to the Senate      floor.       If they are afraid of being tarred as partisan extremists      for opposing Ashcroft's nomination, they ought to recognize      that Bush's decision to appoint Ashcroft was in itself an      unapologetic partisan action.       The Senate almost never rejects a president's cabinet      nominee, and the vote count suggests it will not reject      Ashcroft. It would be an extraordinary turn of events if it      did.       That's because Senate Republicans are lined up unanimously      on the side of their party and their president. That includes      Sen. James Jeffords, who is a member of a vocal quartet with      Ashcroft and who plans to endorse his appointment.       This is not one of those moments when the Senate's moderate      Republicans are inclined to stray from the party line. On      other issues--campaign finance, tax cuts, missile defense--     the Republican leadership will not be able to rely so surely      on unanimity within the party.       Ashcroft's nomination has also won the support of a few      Democrats, which assures him of victory in the Senate. But      for most Democrats, a no vote on the Ashcroft nomination      sends an important signal: that bipartisan progress is not      achieved by pushing the most extreme brand of Republican      ideology.       Under questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee,      Ashcroft felt compelled to repudiate an ideology opposed to      civil and women's rights. One wonders why Bush appointed him      if it meant he would have to shed the views that have shaped      his career. The likely reason is that Bush wanted to appease      the religious right.       Everyone was quick to praise Ashcroft's integrity and to      deny that he was a racist. But what kind of integrity is      involved in the attempt to smear another person's reputation,      as he did with Ronnie White, a judge who had been appointed      to the federal bench?       In many areas, Democrats are likely to cooperate with      Republicans for the sake of bipartisan achievement. It      appears that Sens. Joseph Lieberman and Edward Kennedy are      willing to work with Bush to put together an education      package. And Bush appears willing to court Democratic support      by gearing his education package toward low-income students.       In the same vein, Republicans such as Jeffords should be      willing to break the party line for the sake of campaign      finance reform, health care, and other initiatives that the      Republican leadership has long opposed.       The Senate Judiciary Committee was able to win concessions      from Ashcroft on civil rights and women's rights, but his      work as attorney general will involve far more than the high-     profile issues on which the interest groups always focus.       He will help shape anti-trust policy and the government's      position on the Microsoft case. He will help shape policy on      juvenile justice, which has been slipping back toward the      dark ages, and on sentencing policy, which has become      dangerously rigid because of mandatory sentences. He will      apportion resources within the Department of Justice,      deciding how much emphasis to put on civil rights      enforcement.       In electing a Republican, Vermonters might have expected      that Jeffords would maintain party loyalty in instances such      as the Ashcroft nomination. Jeffords will have many other      opportunities to show his independence, and Vermonters will      be watching.       In electing a Democrat, Vermonters expect Leahy to uphold      civil and women's rights. In voting no on Ashcroft, he will      be affirming that even with a Republican president, these      values should not be allowed to erode.                                  ____               [From the National Journal, Jan. 13, 2001]          A Character Assassin Should Not Be Attorney General                         (By Stuart Taylor Jr.)       Former Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., is an able and      accomplished man who won the respect of many Senate      colleagues in both parties. But he is unfit to be Attorney      General. The reason is that during an important debate on a      sensitive matter, then-Sen. Ashcroft abused the power of his      office by descending to demagoguery, dishonesty, and      character assassination.       The debate was over President Clinton's nomination of      Missouri Supreme Court Judge Ronnie White to become a federal      district judge. Although too liberal to be picked by a      Republican President, White had shown himself to be an      honest, skilled, and sometimes eloquent jurist, well within      the moderate mainstream. But Ashcroft, leaning hard on      Republican Senators who would otherwise have voted to      confirm, engineered a 54-45 party-line vote on Oct. 5, 1999,      to reject White's nomination. Worse, Ashcroft claimed on the      Senate floor that Judge White had ``a serious bias against .      . . the death penalty''; that he was ``pro-criminal and      activist, [and would] push law in a pro-criminal direction'';      and that he had ``a tremendous bent toward criminal      activity.'' The first statement was a wild exaggeration. The      second was a demagogic distortion. The third was a malicious      smear.       Ashcroft is not the man to head the Justice Department. The      job is vested with such vast authority over the lives of      people great and small, and such symbolic importance, that      the minimum qualifications should include honesty, fair-     mindedness, and judicious self-restraint in the exercise of      power. Every new President is entitled to Senate deference in      choosing his Cabinet, even when the nominee's policy views      draw bitter liberal or conservative opposition. (Linda Chavez      might have become a distinguished Labor Secretary but for her      sad mistake of failing to tell Bush vetters up front what      they needed to know about her illegal-immigrant issue.) But      no President is entitled to put a character assassin in      charge of law enforcement.       All this would be true even if Judge White were white, if      Ashcroft had not expressed such fondness for the Confederacy,      if race were not an issue, and if Ashcroft were in tune with      the Bush pledge to be a uniter, not a divider. But White is      black. The racial context makes Ashcroft's orchestration of a      floor vote against a judicial nominee, the first since 1987      (when Robert H. Bork's Supreme Court nomination went down),      all the more deplorable. And Ashcroft's confrontational      advocacy of absolutist views makes him a divider, not a      uniter.       This is not to endorse the unfounded and tiresomely      irresponsible suggestions by some liberal critics that      Ashcroft's attacks on Judge White were motivated by racial      bias or hostility to antidiscrimination laws. Nor is it to      join the claque who would fight any conservative nominee for      Justice as racially insensitive and divisive. But it does      appear that Ashcroft was deliberately engaging in      inflammatory racial politics--in part to boost his own 2000      re-election prospects by hanging the ``pro-criminal'' label      both on Judge White and on then-Gov. Mel Carnahan, who had      appointed White and was gunning for Ashcroft's Senate seat.      Ashcroft must have known that accusing a black judge      (falsely) of being ``pro-criminal'' and of ``a tremendous      bent toward criminal activity'' would stir the worst      instincts of those voters who stereotype criminality as      black.       One result of Ashcroft's reckless roiling of racial      tensions is that he would have especially low credibility      with the vast majority of African-Americans, including      moderates and conservatives who eschew the race-baiting      rhetoric of victimologists such as the Rev. Jesse Jackson.      Indeed, people who hope to see the Justice Department move      away from its long-standing advocacy of race-based      affirmative action preferences (as I do) should wonder: Can      John Ashcroft be a credible advocate of making the law more      color-blind? I doubt it.       Deceptive rhetoric aside, is Ronnie White soft on crime?      Not unless one equates measured concern for civil liberties      with softness. According to Justice Department numbers,      White, as of October 1999, had voted to uphold 41 (almost 70      percent) of the 59 death sentences he had reviewed. He voted      to reverse the other 18, including 10 that were unanimously      reversed and just three in which he was the only dissenter.      (Some say that White reviewed 61 death sentences and voted to      reverse 20.) His rate of affirmance was only marginally lower      than the 75 percent to 81 percent averages of the five      current Missouri Supreme Court judges whom Ashcroft himself      appointed when he was governor.       Ashcroft stressed that Judge White had dissented from      decisions affirming death sentences four times as often as      any Ashcroft-appointed colleague. True. But does this suggest      that White would ``push law in a pro-criminal direction,'' as      Ashcroft said--or that Ashcroft appointees were rubber-     stamping unfair trials?       The two dissents most directly assailed by Ashcroft in fact      exude moderation and care in dealing with the tension between      crime-fighting and civil liberties. In a 1998 decision, the      majority upheld the murder convictions and death sentence of      a previously law-abiding Vietnam veteran named James Johnson,      who had suddenly turned violent. He stalked and killed a      sheriff, two deputies, and another sheriff's wife in a      horrifying succession of shootings that erupted out of a      domestic dispute. The only defense was insanity. The      immediate issue was whether Johnson should get a new trial,      after which he would either go back to death row or be locked      up in a mental hospital.       If Johnson ``was in control of his faculties when he went      on this murderous rampage,'' Judge White wrote, ``then he      assuredly deserves the death sentence he was given.'' But the      jury's consideration of the insanity defense had been skewed      by an egregious blunder. Johnson's court-appointed attorney      had begun by stressing that a rope-and-tin-can ``perimeter''      around Johnson's garage was evidence that he had been under a      delusion that he was back in Vietnam, at war. This was a gift      to the prosecution, which blew the back-in-Vietnam strategy      to bits by showing that the police had set up the perimeter.       Both Judge White and his colleagues faulted the defense      attorney (for inadequate investigation) as well as the      prosecution (for leaving the defense attorney with a false      impression of the facts). They differed only on whether there      was a ``reasonable probability'' that the jury might      otherwise have found Johnson insane. The majority said no.      Judge White said yes. His conclusion was plausible,      debatable, highly unpopular (especially among police), and      (for that reason) courageous. For Ashcroft to call it ``pro-     criminal'' was obscene.       In the second case, one Brian Kinder was sentenced to die      for a heinous rape-murder. Judge White's ``only basis'' for      voting to give Kinder a new trial, Ashcroft claimed, was that      the trial judge had said he was ``opposed to affirmative      action.'' False. In fact, Judge White's dissent termed that      comment (made in a campaign press release) ``irrelevant to      the issue of bias.'' Instead he stressed another,      ``indefensibly racist'' assertion in which the trial judge      had contrasted ``minorities'' with ``hard-working      taxpayers.'' This cast grave doubt on the impartiality of a      judge who was to try a black man for murder in just six days,      Judge White concluded. His dissent was far more candid and      convincing than the majority opinion.       Pro-criminal? Some police groups, including 77 of      Missouri's 114 sheriffs, criticized Judge White's record. But      other law enforcement officials praised him as a good judge      and ``an upright, fine individual,'' in the words of Carl      Wolf, president of the Missouri Police Chiefs Association.       The smearing of Judge White makes the many testimonials to      Ashcroft's integrity ring a bit hollow. But quite apart from      that episode, it was most unwise for President-elect Bush to      choose Ashcroft for Attorney General. The reason is that      Ashcroft is an uncompromising absolutist with a bellicose      approach to issues ranging from gay rights and gun control to      abortion (which would be a crime, if Ashcroft had his way,      even in cases of rape and incest). He is also dead wrong (in      my view) on major issues, including his aggressive push to      cram even more nonviolent, small-time offenders who pose no      threat to society into our prison-industrial complex, which      has already mushroomed to 2 million inmates.       What would I be saying if it were President-elect Al Gore      trying to put the Justice Department under (say) Sen. Edward      Kennedy, D-Mass.--who smeared another judicial nominee (in      1987) by saying: ``Robert Bork's America is a land in which      women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would      sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break      down citizens' doors in midnight raids .  .  .''       I would be saying that a character assassin should not be      Attorney General. How about you?                                  ____               [From the National Journal, Oct. 16, 1999]                   The Shame of The Ronnie White Vote                         (By Stuart Taylor Jr.)       The Democratic spin is that the Republican Senate's Oct. 5      party-line vote, 54-45, to reject Ronnie L. White's      nomination for a U.S. District Court seat in Missouri was      tinged with racism. At the very least, as President Clinton      put it, the vote adds ``credence to the perceptions that they      treat minority and women judicial nominees unfairly and      unequally.''       The Republican spin is, not surprisingly, quite different.      In the words of White's main critic, Sen. John Ashcroft, R-     Mo., White's record as a Missouri Supreme Court judge is      ``pro-criminal and activist,'' and exudes a serious bias      against * * * the death penalty,'' even ``a tremendous bent      toward criminal activity,'' Indeed, said Sen. Don Nickles, R-     Okla. ``many'' Republican Senators ``didn't know what race      Judge White is.''       Which is the closer to the truth?       Numbers supply part of the answer. Judge White has voted to      uphold 70 percent (41) of the 59 death sentences he has      reviewed, while voting to reverse the other 18, including 10      that were unanimously reversed and three in which he was the      only dissenter. That's a bit below the 75 percent to 81      percent averages of the five current Missouri Supreme Court      judges whom Ashcroft himself appointed when he was Governor,      according to numbers compiled by the Missouri Democratic      Party. It's well above the 53 percent average of Elwood      Thomas, the now-deceased Ashcroft appointee whom White      replaced in 1995.       As for race, the raw fact is that the Senate's rejection of      the 46-year-old White--the first black person ever to sit on      the Missouri Supreme Court--was its first floor vote against      any judicial nominee since 1987, when the Senate spurned      Robert H. Bork for the U.S. Supreme Court. But Democrats are      quick to cite statistics showing that the Senate has      confirmed a substantially smaller percentage of Clinton's      minority judicial nominees than of his white nominees--while      taking longer to bring their nominations to a vote. Some      Republicans claim that a higher percentage of Clinton's      minority nominees are liberal activists. Perhaps that's true.      But does Ronnie White fit that bill?       Consider White's two lone death-penalty dissents      specifically criticized by Ashcroft. One involved a rape-     murder for which one     Brian Kinder was sentenced to die. Judge White's ``only      basis'' for voting to give Kinder a new trial, Ashcroft told      his colleagues, was that Earl R. Blackwell, the trial judge,      had said he was ``opposed to affirmative action.''       This was a cynical distortion. In fact, White's dissent      stated that Judge Black-well's criticism of affirmative      action--which came in a campaign press release explaining his      decision to leave the Democratic Party--was ``irrelevant to      the issue of bias.'' What was ``indefensibly racist,'' he      continued, was the following assertion in Blackwell's press      release:       ``While minorities need to be represented or [sic] course,      I believe the time has come for us to place much more      emphasis and concern on the hard-working taxpayers in this      country.''       As White wrote, this ``pernicious racial stereotype * * *      is not ambiguous or complex (nor, unfortunately, original).''      It means ``that minorities are not hard-working taxpayers.''       And for Judge Blackwell to issue such a statement--six days      before he was to begin the trial of a black man facing the      death penalty--``created a reasonable suspicion that he could      not preside over the case impartially.''       Judge White was right. And his eloquent dissent was both      more candid and more consistent with his court's own      precedents than was the majority opinion.       Ashcroft also assailed White's dissent from a 1998 decision      upholding the murder convictions and death sentence of      one James Johnson. In an appalling succession of shootings      growing out of a domestic dispute at Johnson's home, the      previously law abiding Vietnam veteran had stalked and      killed a sheriff, two deputies, and the wife of another      sheriff. His only defense was insanity.       ``If Mr. Johnson was in control of his faculties when he      went on this murderous rampage, then he assuredly deserves      the death sentence he was given,'' Judge White wrote. But a      blunder by Johnson's defense lawyer, White added, had so      ``utterly destroyed the credibility'' of his insanity defense      as to deny him a fair trial.       In his opening statement, the defense lawyer had focused on      a story that Johnson--who claimed to have no memory of what      he had done--had strung a ``perimeter'' of rope and cans      around his garage under the delusion that he was ``back in      Vietnam,'' in combat. This scenario was soon exposed as      fiction: The prosecution revealed with a flourish that the      ``perimeter'' had been the work of police staking out      Johnson's home after the killings.       The majority and Judge White alike faulted both the defense      lawyer (for inadequate investigation) and the state (for      leaving him with a false impression of the facts). They      differed on whether there was a ``reasonable probability''      that, but for these unprofessional lapses, the jury might      have upheld the insanity defense. The majority said no; Judge      White--noting that Johnson's homicidal conduct suggested at      least ``something akin to madness''--said yes.       I'm not sure whether he was right. But it surely was a case      on which reasonable judges could disagree.       And in another such case, in 1996, it was Judge White who      wrote the court's decision upholding a brutal killer's death      sentence--and it was an Ashcroft appointee, then Chief Judge      John C. Holstein, who dissented. The cornerstone of any      civilized system of justice,'' Holstein wrote then, ``is that      the rules are applied evenly to everyone, no matter how      despicable the crime.''       That does not seem to be the view of many Senate      Republicans now. Their treatment of Ronnie White suggests      that they prefer judges to rubber-stamp the decisions of      trial judges, prosecutors, and police.       Sen. Ashcroft also stressed criticism of White's record by      police groups, including 77 of Missouri's 114 sheriffs. This      may help explain why the state's other Republican Senator,      Christopher S. Bond, joined Ashcroft in opposing Judge White      on the floor--after having introduced him to the Judiciary      Committee last year as ``a man of the highest integrity and      honor,'' with the ``qualifications and character traits'' to      be a federal judge.       But it turns out that Ashcroft himself orchestrated some of      the police opposition. He faces a tough re-election battle      next year and seems to be running as Mr. Death Penalty      against the man who appointed Judge White--Democratic Gov.      Mel Carnahan. (Carnahan also supports the death penalty.)       Ashcroft urged at least two police groups to oppose White,      according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Carl Wolf,      president of the Missouri Police Chiefs Association, told the      newspaper that Ashcroft's office had called to solicit his      opposition. Wolf declined because his group does not comment      on judicial nominations. Besides, he said: ``I really have a      hard time seeing that [White's] against law enforcement. I've      always known him to be an upright, fine individual.''       In short, the record shows that Judge White takes seriously      his duty both to enforce the death penalty and to ensure that      defendants get fair trials. It suggests neither that he's      ``pro-criminal'' nor that he's a liberal activist. What it      does suggest is courage.       And while White may be more sensitive to civil liberties      than his Ashcroft appointed colleagues are, his opinions also      exude a spirit of moderation, care, and candor.       Would the Republicans who voted against Ronnie White--most      of them in deference to Ashcroft and Bond--have treated an      otherwise identical white nominee any better?       I doubt it. But by giving such transparently bogus reasons      for trashing a nominee who happens to be black--at a time      when statistics have already raised troubling questions about      the Senate's handling of minority nominees--Republicans      provoked suspicious not only among those who are profligate      in flinging charges of racism, but also among many fair-     minded people.       And those who claimed to have been ignorant of White's race      compounded insensitivity with obtuseness. Even if true, this      shows that they went into the first floor vote in 12 years to      reject a judicial nominee without listening to what their      Democratic colleagues were saying or learning anything about      the nominee's admirable life story.       In an era of politicized law, as I wrote recently, the best      antidote for partisan gridlock over judicial nominees is for      Presidents to shun ideological crusaders and choose moderate      centrists. That's what President Clinton did here. And that's      why--race aside--the Senate's vote and the smearing of Judge      White were shameful acts of pettiness and partisanship.                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 13, 1999]                          Judge White's Judges                          (By Benjamin Wittes)       Anyone who believes that race played no role in the      Senate's rejection last week of the judicial nomination of      Ronnie White should read the case of Missouri v. Kinder. Sen.      John Ashcroft, the Missouri Republican who led the fight to      kill White's nomination to a federal district court vacancy      in his state, cited Kinder on the Senate floor as one of      three cases that showed not merely White's hostility to the      death penalty but his ``tremendous bent toward criminal      activity.''       Ashcroft described White--the first African American to      serve on Missouri's Supreme Court--as willing to grant a new      trial to a clearly guilty rapist and murderer who had been      sentenced to death, because ``the trial judge had indicated      that he opposed affirmative action and had switched parties      based on that.'' This charge, if true, would indeed be      evidence that White had placed politics before the law. But      it is a gross distortion. The reality is that by using      White's well-reasoned dissent in Kinder as a cudgel against      him, Ashcroft provided as clear an example of racial politics      infecting the nomination process as one could ever hope to      see.       Brian Kinder was tried in the court of an elected judge      named Earl R. Blackwell, At the time of the trial, Blackwell      was facing a reelection campaign. Six days before Kinder's      trial was to begin, Blackwell announced in a press release      that he was switching parties because he found ``repugnant''      the Democratic Party's ``reverse-discriminatory quotas and      affirmative action.''       The politics of the statement were not the problem. The      problem was its all-but-overt racism: ``The truth is that I      have noticed in recent years that the Democrat party places      far too much emphasis on representing minorities such as      homosexuals, people who don't want to work, and people with a      skin that's any color but white. . . . While minorities need      to be represented, of course, I believe the time has come for      us to place much more emphasis and concern on the hard-     working taxpayers in this country.''       Faced with a judge who had just gone on the record      contrasting minorities with hard-working taxpayers, Kinder--     an unemployed black man--asked Blackwell to recuse himself.      The judge refused, saying he did not discriminate whether      individuals ``are yellow, red, white, black or polka dot.''      Kinder, after his conviction, appealed, arguing that the      trial was invalid because recusal should have been mandatory.       The surprising thing about this case is not that Ronnie      White voted to reverse the conviction but that he was the      only member of the Missouri Supreme Court--several of whose      judges were appointed by Ashcroft when he was the state's      governor--to stand up for the principle that a minority      defendant is entitled to a trial before a judge who does not      make public slurs against minority groups. Like Ashcroft, the      court majority pretended Blackwell was merely making a      political statement against affirmative action and concluded      merely making a political statement against affirmative      action and concluded that ``we do not agree that the      statements in the press release . . . would cause a      reasonable person to question the impartiality of the      court.''       White, in an opinion characterized by admirable restraint,      cut through this nonsense. ``No honest reading of      [Blackwell's statement] can show that it says anything other      than what it says: that minorities are not hard-working      taxpayers,'' he wrote. ``I doubt that any reasonable person      would think that a judge who makes provocative comments in a      campaign press release . . . would be able to scrupulously      set aside those views just because the judge dons a robe.''      Because of this appearance problem, he argued, recusal was      required. And ``since the judge here failed to sustain the      motion that he recuse himself, Mr. Kinder must receive a new      trial before a judge whose impartiality is beyond reproach.''       As a general matter, the White House and its allies      overstate the claim that minority and women nominees are      discriminated against in the confirmation process. Having      looked at many nominations, I am convinced that white men      with histories and records similar to those of the women and      minority     nominees who get bogged down in the Senate would also have      problems. And race, to be sure, was not the predominant      factor in White's rejection, either. The politics of the      death penalty and the 2000 Missouri Senate race have that      dishonor.       But if White was not rejected because he's black, it is      also impossible to read racial politics out of his rejection.      Consider what would have happened had White and Kinder both      been Jewish and had Kinder been tried before a judge who had      issued a press release denouncing the political parties'      support for Israel that included analogous language: ``While      Jews need to be represented, of course, I believe the time      has come for us to place much more emphasis and concern on      moral people who are not obsessed with money.''       No senator would dare argue that an appeals court judge who      insisted that such overt hostility to Jews compelled a new      trial--even for a guilty defendant--should be kept off the      federal bench for having done so. To argue that the Kinder      case is reason to keep Ronnie White off the bench is no less      outrageous--just a little more socially acceptable.
