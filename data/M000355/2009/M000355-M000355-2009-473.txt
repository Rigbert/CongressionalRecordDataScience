 President, Americans want answers about how bonuses were handed out at AIG, how it happened, and how to make sure it never happens again.  The President said last night that he wants to make sure we don't find ourselves in this situation again, and I couldn't agree more. He pledged to do everything possible to fix the situation, and certainly we all appreciate that. He has said his administration will ensure that if they provide further assistance, they will renegotiate these types of preexisting contracts. That is good.  I was encouraged to read this morning that some senior executive officers at AIG have agreed to return their bonuses to the taxpayers, including the largest bonus. That is the right thing to do, and it is a clear sign that the taxpayers' voices have been heard. But for now, taxpayers are still looking for an answer to the question of how all of this happened so we can make sure their hard-earned pay isn't wasted in the future.                          ____________________
