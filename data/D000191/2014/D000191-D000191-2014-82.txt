  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, for years, I have struggled with the VA bureaucracy in my region. There are attempts to downgrade the Roseburg Hospital. We are still fighting over adequate status and staffing. It took 6 years after I got funding for a critical new VA clinic in Eugene for them to break ground so we can get expanded services in staffing. Day in and day out my staff and I have to push the VA to get our veterans the benefits they have earned and the services they deserve.  Now we find that these problems were systemic and nationwide. It is right that General Shinseki has resigned, but that is just the beginning of the housecleaning and the reform we need in the Veterans Administration to see that they become an organization that is totally oriented toward serving our veterans and getting them the services they have earned and they deserve. Veterans shouldn't have to fight, they shouldn't have to wait in line. We can do better, and we must.                          ____________________
