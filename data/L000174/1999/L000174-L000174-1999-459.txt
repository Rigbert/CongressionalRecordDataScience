President, look where we are today--another high school shooting incident in Atlanta, four young people, at least in the initial news, injured, not killed. I talked about it with the Attorney General a few minutes ago. She had expressed her concern. I also commended her for her strong words of last week because I believe that helped move this bill forward. We are considering it during the eighth legislative day. We have not spent full days on this important bill. We will not be able to spend a full day. Notwithstanding that, we have made significant progress.  Today, we will also consider the long-delayed emergency supplemental appropriations bill to provide relief for victims of Hurricane Mitch, humanitarian aid in the Balkans, aid for farmers, and aid for the victims of natural disasters, as well as military and other appropriations.  In the time available to us today, I do hope we will be able to move to final passage on this bill.
