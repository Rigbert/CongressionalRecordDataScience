President, on behalf of the majority leader, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until the hour of 1 p.m. Following morning business, if consent is reached, the Senate will begin consideration of the intelligence authorization bill. It is hoped that the Senate will be able to complete action on the intelligence bill in a reasonable time period and, therefore, Senators can anticipate rollcall votes throughout the day. The majority leader has also indicated that it is his hope that the Senate will be able to proceed to the Department of Defense authorization bill following disposition of the intelligence authorization bill.  I thank my colleagues for their attention.                          ____________________
