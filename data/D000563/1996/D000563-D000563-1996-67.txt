Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut [Ms. DeLauro].  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his leadership, and I rise in support of the Durbin-Hansen amendment because it is time to stop spending the taxpayers' hard-earned money to subsidize a product that kills over 1,000 Americans every single day.  Each year more than 400,000 people die prematurely of tobacco use. As my colleague from Delaware pointed out, cigarettes kill more Americans each year than AIDS, alcohol, car accidents, murders, suicide, illegal drugs, and fires combined. Fifty billion dollars is spent on health care related to tobacco use.  Despite all that we know about the health hazards of tobacco, too many of our young people, especially the young ones, continue to light up. In my own State of Connecticut, one out of three 9th through 12th graders have smoked a cigarette in the past month. About one out of five 9th through 12th graders smoke regularly.                              {time}  1715  More preschoolers in this country recognize Joe Camel than they do Mickey Mouse. We have a problem in this country. And industry, like big tobacco, that can find the money to run ads so convincing to appeal especially to young people about the glamour of tobacco surely does not need taxpayers' money.  About 3,000 young people across the Nation under age 18 become regular smokers every day. On average, they start smoking at age 14. Tragically, one out of three of these teenagers will die of a tobacco-related illness. We must stop this killing of our family members and our friends.  I am doing all I can to prevent these tragic deaths. At home I started a campaign called Kick Butts Connecticut, targeted at middle and elementary school kids to prevent them from ever starting to smoke.  More than 80 percent of all adult tobacco smokers had tried smoking before their 18th birthday and more than half of them had already become regular smokers by that age. Studies show that if people do not begin smoking as teenagers or as children, it is very unlikely that they ever will do so.  I think public education campaigns are vital to the war that we are waging against cancer in this country. We truly do need to do more if we are to cut the number of tobacco-related deaths in this country.  And despite the deadly impact of tobacco, some have argued that we cannot simply abandon our Nation's tobacco farmers. This amendment does not abandon them. It takes the $25 million in savings from the elimination of the tobacco subsidy and puts it into productive uses in agricultural regions all over this country. The money saved would be used to improve water and wastewater for development purposes, expand the use of technology and advance education and medicine in rural areas.  These funds would create great alternatives for struggling areas of our country, without relying on taxpayer-funded subsidies to promote an industry that kills. This appropriations bill, like all appropriations bills, is really about out Nation's priorities, and I do not understand how we can support the tobacco subsidies in this bill and at the same time are proposing in other areas to gut and decimate Medicare.  Mr. Chairman, we have the opportunity today to send a very clear message to the cigarette industry and to the grim reaper, big tobacco. Let us stop wasting taxpayers' money to promote an industry that has been truly so costly to this Nation. It is time that big tobacco learned to get along in this business without the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars. It is time that we get the tobacco industry off of the Federal Treasury, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.
