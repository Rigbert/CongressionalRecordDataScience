 President, today I pay tribute and honor a dear friend of mine who passed away recently. Bill David Smith, whom I have called a friend and relied on for half a century, passed away at the age of 72. He is survived by his beloved wife, Jane Bandy Smith, and two sons, David and Stuart. Bill David was passionate about all things in which he was involved, loved his community of Tuscaloosa, and was very proud to be an Alabamian.  We became friends during our time at the University of Alabama, and I have always appreciated his counsel and support over the years. My wife, Annette, and I have shared many memories with Bill David and his wife, Jane, which we will cherish for years to come.  Bill David was born in Meridian, MS, and spent most of his youth in Gadsden, AL. A University of Alabama graduate, he was an honor student and received both a bachelor's and master's degree in accounting. After graduation, he was a founding partner in the accounting firm, Morrison and Smith LLP. Bill David was actively involved in activities surrounding the accounting profession and served as President of the Alabama Society of Certified Public Accountants and Chairman of its State Legislation Committee. He was also a member of the Council of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.  Bill David was a member of the board of directors for the Alabama Trust Fund and the Business Council of Alabama. Dedicated to a number of civic organizations, he served on the Tuscaloosa County Juvenile Advisory Board and the Alabama Juvenile Justice Coordinating Council.  Beyond Bill David's devotion to his work and his community, he was a dedicated friend to many. A good natured person with a huge heart, Bill David often showed compassion for those less fortunate. His quick wit and intellect fostered his passion for policy issues and politics. He cared very deeply for his community and its people.  But most of all, my thoughts and prayers go out to Jane and their two sons. Bill David was a dedicated family man and his presence will be missed by those who knew him best. Indeed, we will all miss him.                          ____________________
