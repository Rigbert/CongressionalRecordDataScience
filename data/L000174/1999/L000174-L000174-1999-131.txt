Mr. Martin should be commended for reaching a settlement with his insurers and the trial bar concerning his firm's asbestos problems. Unlike some big businesses that are trying to avoid any accountability for their asbestos responsibilities through national legislation, Mr. Martin and the Rutland Fire Clay Company are trying to do the right thing within the legal system.  Mr. Martin plans to lead the Rutland Fire Clay Company from bankruptcy next year as a stronger firm with a solid financial foundation for the 21st Century. I applaud Tom Martin and the employees of the Rutland Fire Clay Company for their efforts.  Mr. President, I am willing to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and with interested parties to craft fair legislation to help victims and businesses, large and small, affected by asbestos. But exploiting the bankruptcy filing of a small firm in Vermont and using misleading advertisements to promote a flawed bill are not the right ways to advance our consideration of this issue, and they are certainly not an admirable way to attempt to sway opinion in or outside of this body.  I believe the 240 special interest organizations that sponsored this advertisement owe an apology to Tom Martin and the other Vermonters who work for the Rutland Fire Clay Company, and I will remind them of that obligation until they offer that apology.                             Exhibit No. 1                [From the Rutland Herald, Oct. 19, 1999]                  Rutland Fire Clay Files for Chap. 11  how asbestos litigation ruined a family business: 22 employees and                             50,000 lawsuits       Asbestos lawyers would have you believe that only billion      dollar companies are affected by the asbestos nightmare. But      in reality, more than 300 small businesses, as well as large      ones, find themselves today enmeshed in the asbestos      litigation mess. This spiraling litigation--filed largely by      non-sick claimants who may have been exposed to asbestos, as      have a majority of all Americans, but have no physical      symptoms or impairment--continues to drive firms to      bankruptcy or its brink.       Just last week, Rutland Fire Clay, a small family-owned      Vermont manufacturer of furnace and wood stove repair      cements, was     forced into bankruptcy as a result of what it termed ``the      crushing burden of asbestos related lawsuits.''       You should know these facts about the Rutland Fire Clay      case:       Rutland Fire Clay, with its 22 employees, is a small, 116      year-old family business, in Rutland, Vermont.       The business was started in 1883 by Rufus Perkins and his      two sons and has manufactured, for more than 100 years, a      cement material for use in the repair of furnaces and      residential wood stoves sold through hardware stores. The      product originally contained a very small amount of      encapsulated asbestos, although Rutland discontinued the use      of asbestos in its products almost 30 years ago.       Since 1984, there have been 50,000 asbestos cases filed      against the company, and 37,000 remain pending today--most of      these cases involving non-sick claimants.       The company has estimated its liability for current and      future asbestos claims at $67 million, with assets of only $3      million.       Thomas Martin, the firm's president, said in a Rutland      press interview last week, that if it weren't for asbestos      claims, the 116 year-old company would never have wound up in      bankruptcy. He described business as ``excellent,'' with the      company expecting a record sales year.       The Rutland Fire Clay case is a stark example of what      happens in the asbestos litigation world today. Asbestos      lawyers continue to draw from an almost limitless pool of      potential defendants by targeting, with the touch of a word      processing button, small and large companies--many with only      a tangential association to asbestos. These ``asbestos''      defendants include local building products distributors, home      remodeling centers, ``mom and pop'' hardware stores, and      other unsuspecting companies who manufactured, or only      distributed, products that may have contained nominal amounts      of asbestos in a component part of end products, such as      forklifts, cranes, gaskets, grinding wheels, lawnmower      engines, etc.       While the principal focus of the bipartisan Fairness in      Asbestos Compensation Act is, as it should be, on the rights      of deserving asbestos victims, we believe that the interests      of the hundreds of large and small businesses affected by      this national travesty, their employees, pensioners,      communities who depend upon them, and their millions of      shareholders warrant your support of the Act as well.                                  ____                             Exhibit No. 2                                    Rutland Fire Clay Company,                                    Rutland, VT, October 29, 1999.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: Thank you for sending me the recent      advertisement produced by the Coalition for Asbestos      Resolution (CAR) that is using our recent bankruptcy filing      in its campaign in support of S. 758 and its companion, H.R.      1283.       We presently have over 37,000 lawsuits pending against us      and we have approximately $4 million of insurance and $2      million in assets. For small firms such as ours with limited      remaining insurance and minimal assets, the burden of claims      is indeed crushing as quoted in the CAR advertisement.      However, I reviewed this bill and my opinion is it would not      help Rutland Fire Clay Company reduce this burden, nor would      it help any other small business with thousands of claims. As      an example under section 601 apportionment of costs for the      ARC are addressed. Potential disputes could easily arise      between defendants as to their respective share of costs. Our      company cannot afford the expense of litigation if      disagreement with the large defendants is the result. In      addition, our historical costs per claim processed for      defense and indemnity have been very low relative to that of      other defendant companies. Under S. 758 costs would be      apportioned to Rutland Fire Clay Company equally, and thus      higher, than under the current system.       The advertisement's headline gave the impression that our      family business would be ``ruined'' and that our 22 employees      would be out of work. The truth is that we have worked out a      consensual bankruptcy plan which recognizes the value of      Rutland Fire Clay Company and its employees. No jobs will be      lost and we will continue to serve the fireplace and home      repair markets as we have for 116 years.       Lastly, our firm in no way assisted in preparation of the      CAR advertisement nor did we have any knowledge of it until      our office sent me a copy.       Thank you,           Sincerely,                                                 Thomas P. Martin,     President.                          ____________________
