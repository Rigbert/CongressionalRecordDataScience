The President of the United States, having waited for a year and a half, having heard all of the promises of the House Republicans, that they would move forward and finally call this bill, having been promised privately and even publicly by many of those Republicans that they were going to do something, now the President has said: I am going to use my authority, my authority under the law, to try to fix at least some part of this broken immigration system.  We are expecting, any day now, for the President to announce his Executive order. He will not be the first President to do this. Past administrations, Democratic and Republican, have stopped the deportation of low-priority cases in our country. Every President of the United States--every President of the United States since Dwight David Eisenhower has used his Executive authority to improve our immigration system by Executive order, every single one of them.  President George H.W. Bush issued a family fairness policy allowing 1.5 million people in America to apply for deferred action and work permits. It is clear that Presidents have the authority to do this. Yet the Republicans in the Senate and House have threatened this President that if he uses his Executive authority, as every President since President Eisenhower has done: We are going to hold it against you and you are going to pay a price, President Obama.  I hope the President pays little or no attention to that kind of threat. What is at stake is the future of millions of family members who are now subject to deportation. What is at stake is whether the Republican Party will come into the 21st century in this land of immigrants and join us in a bipartisan effort to fix this broken immigration system.  What is at stake are literally the futures of millions of families who just want a chance. That is all they are asking for, to earn their way into legal status in America. It is almost 13 yearsnow since I introduced the DREAM Act. The DREAM Act--I described it earlier--gives young people brought to the United States at an early age, who had no voice in what their families were going to do, to come to this country and eventually find their way to legal status.  At one point even the House Republicans said they supported this so-called DREAM Act. Time and again we have faced filibusters stopping the DREAM Act from passing in the Senate, but it was part of comprehensive immigration reform. This DREAM Act all started with this young lady, Tereza Lee, Korean, brought to the United States at the age of 2, grew up in a poor family in Chicago, had an amazing musical talent and was accepted to the Manhattan Conservatory of Music and the Julliard School of Music. Because she was undocumented she had no place to go.  Her mother called our office. Her mother, who incidentally worked night and day in a dry cleaning establishment in Chicago said: What can we do? The law had no real answer, other than to say to this then-18-year-old girl: Go back to where you came from for 10 years and try to come here legally.  That was the law. I introduced the DREAM Act. Since then we have seen a growth in support for this because it is only fair. We cannot, should not, hold children responsible for the decisions and wrongdoing of their parents. These kids deserve a chance. That is what the President's Executive action is about. That is why the action by the House Republicans was so reprehensible.  Tereza Lee, incidentally made it. She went to the Manhattan Conservatory of Music. She ended up not only getting a bachelor's degree, she did not receive any government assistance. She had friends and sponsors who stepped in to pay for it. She played at Carnegie Hall. She is now working on her Ph.D. in music.  She is now an American citizen, by virtue of the fact that she married this young American jazz musician. They are living in New York and recently had a baby.  I could not be prouder of Tereza Lee and what she has done with her life. There is a picture with her mom and dad. Her dad passed away. He had a serious medical illness that could not be treated adequately because he does not qualify for any kind of government health insurance. They did not have the money to provide him the care he needed.  But Tereza Lee's story is one that inspires me every day to come to this floor and remind my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, these are real human beings we are talking about. These are not political pawns. These are young people who deserve a chance to become part of the future of America. Sometime soon, I hope very soon, maybe even this Friday, the President of the United States is going to announce his Executive order.  He is going to say that, as he did with DACA, the Deferred Action Program, he is going to give more undocumented people in this country a chance. It will be a narrow category, not as broad as we would like it--at least some of us would like it--but it will be consistent with what every President of the United States has done since President Eisenhower.  It is fair. It is just. It recognizes our birthright as Americans, as a nation of immigrants. It says we are willing to stand and fight for fairness. I would hope--I would just hope that a few Republicans will stand and acknowledge this. I hope a few of them will join us in a bipartisan recognition that our broken immigration system cannot be fixed if the Congress of the United States--particularly the Republican House--refuses to even call the bill for a year and a half.  Instead, the President is using his authority and doing the best he can to make this Nation of immigrants proud again that we are welcoming a new generation of people who will make us even stronger in the future.                          ____________________
