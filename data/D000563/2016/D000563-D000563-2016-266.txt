President, 2 weeks ago I lost a dear friend and my hometown of Springfield, IL, lost one of its best. His name was Earl Wallace Henderson, but everyone knew him as Wally. He was an acclaimed architect who helped design Springfield's future while, at the same time, preserving its priceless past as the hometown of President Abraham Lincoln.  In the 1960s, Ferry & Henderson, the architectural firm he co-founded, took on one of its most important projects: expanding Illinois' historic old State capitol building to include underground parking, room for the State historical library, and other modern amenities.  The concept of architectural preservation was relatively at that time, and Wally became one of its pioneering leaders. Expanding the old State capitol involved taking the building apart piece by piece, cataloguing and moving more than 3,300 stones to the Illinois fairground, and then painstakingly rebuilding the structure over the new parking garage and library.  Wally's decades of innovative work in architectural preservation earned him admission in 2011 to the American Institute of Architects College of Fellows, one of the highest honors in his field.  Interestingly, Wally became an architect almost by accident. What he wanted to be all through high school was an astronaut. More to the point, he wanted to be the first man to walk on the moon. This was back in the late 1940s, which gives you an idea of Wally's ability to imagine a future that few others could see.  Wally left Springfield in 1949 to study aeronautical engineering at the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign. He was his parent's only child, and the first person in his extended family ever to go to college. When he came home for spring break during his freshman year, his parents were so proud of their son, the college student, that they invited a bunch of friends over.  One of the neighbors asked Wally, ``What are you studying?''  Wally told them, ``Aeronautical engineering.''  Another neighbor asked, ``So you want to build airplanes, do you?''  Wally replied, ``No, I want to be the first man on the moon.''  Years later in an interview, he recalled what followed.  ``As those folks departed my mother said, `Here, sit down, your dad and I want to talk to you for a moment.' ''  Wally sat down between his dad and his mom, whom he respected greatly. His mother said, ``You know, it's alright to say that to your dad and me about `wanting to go to the moon.' But everybody else thinks you're crazy.''  That was the end of Wally's dreams of being an astronaut. He went back to the university and asked a counselor what other school on campus would accept the credits he had earned.  Fortunately for Springfield, Wally's counselor suggested architectural engineering. That was the start of his long and distinguished career.  Wally graduated from the University of Illinois in 1954, moved to Indianapolis, and went to work for an engineering firm. Six months later, he was drafted into the Army and sent to Korea. This was several months after the ceasefire that ended the conflict. Wally was assigned to an engineering battalion.  One day, a young Korean boy about 11 years old was polishing Wally's boots to earn money for his family. The boy was telling Wally about his hometown, a little village. He said it was the best village in the world.  Wally said he started bragging about his own hometown, reached into his pocket and pulled out the only coin he had, a penny with Lincoln's image on it, and said, ``I'm from his hometown.''  The little boy had probably never traveled farther than 10 miles from his own village, but when he saw that penny, his face lit up. To this young boy, Wally said, ``Abraham Lincoln was everything.'' Right there, 3,000 miles from home, Wally listened as this Korean child told him the story of the Great Emancipator.  Wally was stunned. He thought, ``Here I am, from Abraham Lincoln's hometown. I lived nine or ten blocks from Lincoln's home, and this child knows as much about Abraham Lincoln as I do.''  Over the next several decades, that would change. As an architect and architectural preservationist, Wally would play a crucial role in helping to preserve what is now called the Lincoln Home National Historic Site and the Capital Complex. As I mentioned, he also helped preserve and rebuild the old State capitol in Springfield, where Abraham Lincoln delivered his famous ``House Divided'' speech, warning that the Nation could not endure half slave and half free. Coincidentally, it was also at the old State capitol that another lanky lawyer from Illinois, Barack Obama, announced his candidacy for President of the United States in 2007.  I was honored to serve with Wally Henderson on the commission that helped create the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield. We also served together on the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Committee, which helped lead the Nation in remembering Abraham Lincoln during 2009, the bicentennial of his birth.  Wally was a past president and longtime board member of the Abraham Lincoln Association, a distinguished group of Lincoln scholars. In 2009, the Lincoln Association awarded him its Logan Hay Medal, for his work in preserving and making more accessible buildings and landmarks associated with President Lincoln's life.  In 2013, the Springfield Journal Register named Wally Henderson Springfield's ``First Citizen.'' The ceremony took place, fittingly, at the old State capitol State historic site, which Wally's firm had helped to restore.  That Wally became such an important and cherished part of Springfield is a bit of an irony. You see, when Wally Henderson left Springfield to go to college, he vowed to himself that he would never move back.  After serving in Korea, Wally used the G.I. Bill to earn his master's degree in architecture at the University of Illinois. He met his first wife, Sally; they got married, and Wally landed a great job working as an architect in Denver.  Then came the fateful phone call: Wally was contacted by a young architect in Springfield, the brother-in-law of Wally's best friend in high school. The brother-in-law's name was Don Ferry. He was working for a Springfield firm that was designing hospitals, and they needed another architect. Was Wally interested?  Wally came home, talked with Don Ferry, and left unimpressed. He went back to Denver and finished work on a church that his firm was building in the Rocky Mountains. The completed church was spectacular. At its grand opening, Sally nudged Wally and said, ``You're leaving.'' She knew that Wally needed another professional challenge. So, at the age of 28, after 4 years as an architect in Denver, Wally packed up his wife and baby and moved home.  He told Don Ferry that he would work with him, but he had conditions. He told Don, ``You quit your job, I'll quit my job and we'll open an office in Springfield because, by God, Springfield needs higher education and a whole bunch of other things.''  His other condition: Wally said, ``We're not competing with anybody. We're going to bring contemporary architecture to Springfield, Illinois'' There were about a dozen architectural firms in town at that time, but no one was doing much of anything new.  Wally Henderson and Don Ferry formed their own firm, Ferry & Henderson Architects, in 1961. They started out in a one-room office that contained two stools, a drafting table, and a telephone. They worked together for decades and literally transformed Springfield.  They spearheaded projects including the Springfield Municipal Plaza, the Willard Ice Building, and the building that houses the Springfield Journal-Register.  One reason Wally had vowed never to return to Springfield was because the town lacked a university. Ferry & Henderson helped rectify that omission when their firm designed the Public Affairs Building, the first permanent building at Sangamon State University, now the University of Illinois at Springfield. Wally remained a strong supporter of the university until the end of his life.  When Wally moved back to Springfield, the area surrounding the Lincoln Home was run-down and nondescript. Wally helped stir Springfield's civic pride and its resolve to take care of its priceless legacy as Abraham Lincoln's hometown. I have been proud to have my congressional and Senate offices in this restored area.  Just as that little Korean boy had enabled Wally to see Springfield through new eyes, Wally helped others in Springfield to envision a future in which the Lincoln Home, the old State capitol, and other places that Lincoln loved would become the crown jewels of America's Lincoln historic sites.  Last year, more than 233,000 people visited the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, up nearly 20 percent from the year before. Those visitors spent more than $13.8 million at local businesses.  My wife, Loretta, and I were fortunate to count Wally Henderson as a dear friend and neighbor. We both extend our condolences to Wally's wife, Brynn, and to their children and grandchildren, all of whom Wally loved deeply.  When Abraham Lincoln left Springfield to start his inaugural journey to Washington, friends from all over town came to see him off at the Great Western Railway station. In what is now known as his Farewell Address, the new President said: ``My friends, no one, not in my situation, can appreciate my feeling of sadness at this parting. To this place, and the kindness of these people, I owe everything.'' He closed by saying, ``I bid you an affectionate farewell.''  Likewise, to my old friend Wally Henderson, who did so much to preserve the legacy of President Lincoln and to enrich our hometown in so many other ways, I bid you an affectionate farewell.                          ____________________
