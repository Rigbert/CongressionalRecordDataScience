 President, like so many of my colleagues, I want to rise today and pay tribute to the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who lost his life in the name of peace this past Saturday in Tel Aviv.  Many of us have spent the last several days mourning the loss of a great man--not only for Israel but also for the world. On Monday, Kings, Presidents and Princes gathered in Jerusalem to pay tribute to this finest of leaders--the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. But as I listened to the statements of praise and honor, I was struck most by the words of his granddaughter, who spoke of his place in Heaven more than his place in history. ``Grandfather,'' she said, ``may the God of Israel that keeps over all of us keep you in Heaven, as you merit.''  Heaven now cradles the man who spent his life fighting wars and waging peace on behalf of the great nation of Israel. And so it is left to those of us still living to carry his torch--that ``pillar of fire'' described by his granddaughter, that lit a path toward peace few thought possible. Yitzhak Rabin, we will miss your vision and courage. But we will not let the message of your life be lost. Today it falls to each of us, citizens and leaders of all nations, to guarantee that your legacy of peace is fully realized.  Yitzhak Rabin was trusted by Israelis first for his military knowledge, and later for his political leadership. He has been a central actor in his nation's history since its founding in 1948, leading his country through times of war and peace. His was truly a remarkable life, held together by a singular, unwavering commitment to the security of Israel.  Yitzhak Rabin once said that he worked to end the hostilities in the region so that his children and his children's children would no longer ``experience the painful cost of war.'' Today, on behalf of Yitzhak Rabin's granddaughter and all the children of Israel, we must not ask if the Middle East peace process can survive, but rather, how. We must devote ourselves to that goal with unity and courage.  For my part, my commitment to ensuring a strong and secure Israel remains steadfast. As always, Israel has a true and lasting friend in the United States. Since its founding, the American people have stood by Israel in the search for peace and stability. Today, as Israeli citizens mourn, we stand by our friend. In the months ahead, we will stand by Israel's side as that nation heals, and as it finds the courage to take the next step toward peace.  Shalom, Yitzhak Rabin. We praise your life and the gifts you gave to Israel and the world community.                          ____________________
