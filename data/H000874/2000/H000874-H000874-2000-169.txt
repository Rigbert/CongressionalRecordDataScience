Speaker, earlier today I attended a ceremony in Pennsylvania for the National Governor's Association. Maryland Governor Parris Glendening today became the Chairman of the National Governor's Association and because of my attendance, I was unable to vote on H. Con. Res. 253, H.R. 4442, and H. Res. 415. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yes'' on rollcall 379, 380, and 381.                          ____________________
