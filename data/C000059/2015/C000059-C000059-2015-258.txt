Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose commitment and contributions to the City of Murrieta, California are exceptional. Murrieta has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Murrieta Fire Chief, Matt Shobert, is one of these individuals. On Tuesday, January 20, 2015, Matt Shobert will be honored for his devoted and valiant service to the people of Murrieta.  Matt began his firefighting career in Tucson, Arizona, actively working his way to leading the fire department in Sedona, Arizona. He then brought his talent and leadership to the Hemet Fire Department, in which he served as Fire Chief for three years. Matt was then appointed as Murrieta's Fire Chief in March of 2011 in which he enthusiastically served the community for nearly four years.  Chief Shobert holds a Master Degree in Organizational Management, a Bachelor's Degree in Business Management and an Associate's Degree in Fire Science. In addition, Matt also graduated from the National Fire Academy's Executive Fire Officers' Program, has been accredited three times as a Chief Fire Officer Designee by the Center for Public Safety Excellence and has also been awarded membership into the Institution of Fire Engineers.  Chief Matt Shobert is retiring after incurring a devastating injury while doing what he enjoyed most, keeping the people of Murrieta safe. Throughout his tenure, Fire Chief Matt Shobert continued the distinguished history of the Murrieta Fire Department, working daily to improve the partnership held with the community and by enhancing the strong sense of camaraderie amongst the firefighters in his department.  Fire Chief Matt Shobert has been an excellent public servant who has consistently provided for the safety and well-being of the community of Murrieta. His legacy will serve as a shining example and constant reminder of what it means to be a public servant and I am proud to call Matt a fellow community member, American and friend.
