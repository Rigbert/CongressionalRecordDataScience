 Speaker, today I recognize the outstanding work done by participants in my Student Congressional Town Meeting held this summer. These participants were part of a group of high school students from around Vermont who testified about the concerns they have as teenagers, and about what they would like to see government do regarding these concerns.    On Behalf of Stacey Caron and Dalaina Buffum--Regarding Freeing     Families From the High Cost of a College Education, May 7, 2001       Congressman Sanders. Stacey, just bring the mike real close      so everybody can hear you. This is a very important issue.       Stacey Caron. Every day at school, students hear their      peers here talking about where they're going to college and      who is going to what college. When the students go home at      night for dinner, they usually sit down to have dinner with      their parents. This is a time to talk about what's going on      in everybody's life. I know, when I go home, I always get      asked how my day was at school, and my parents are always on      my back about college. Did I fill out the applications yet or      the scholarship forms? So many students go through twelve      years of school and work very hard to get good grades so they      can get into a good college, yet many of these honor-roll      students' families don't have enough money to send their      children through college. It's a complete waste of talent.      There are scholarships that are offered to students who      excel, but how many students are going to get these      scholarships and how much money are they going to get? These      questions are not questions students should be asking      themselves. After all the hard work students go through in      school, they should be able to go to college free of charge      as long as they get accepted. Its like hard work isn't      enough, you now have to pay to go to college, to get a good      job, and be a success in life. To me, that doesn't seem      right.       Dalaina Buffum. The financial burden of college can      sometimes scare students away, only because they are afraid.      They aren't ready to make the commitment of leaving home,      especially the financial commitment. Most students don't get      out of debt until they are in their thirties. How is someone      supposed to start a family and their life while they're still      paying off debts? We have done research on this topic and      discovered a very different system which is used over in      Europe. There is a very hard test that each student that      wants to go to university has to take. If you pass the exam      with a certain grade, you can go to university free of      charge. However, if you don't pass the exam, you can't go to      college. This is very different, but at the same time proves      how much a student is ready and how much they want to go to      college and further their education. We believe that there      should be a similar system here. This would enable more     students who are qualified to go to college, and may boost a      student's motivation to succeed in high school so they are      ready for the test. We feel that this is an important issue      that is worth looking into.                                  ____                                   On Behalf of Angela DeBlasio and Lynne Clough--Regarding ``Rich Man's                 Return'' on Bush's Tax Cut, May 7, 2001        Angela DeBlasio. President Bush has proposed a very large      federal tax cut as the centerpiece of his campaign. The $1.9      trillion ten-year cost of the plan would use up more than all      the projected surpluses over the next ten years. Most of the      proposed tax cuts will go to the upper-income taxpayers, with      43 percent of the tax cut targeted to the top 1 percent.       Lynne Clough. The cost of President George W. Bush's plan      is enormous. Based on the official projections from the      Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on      Taxation, the Bush tax cut would use up slightly more than      all of the projected surpluses over the first ten years. Over      the fiscal period 2002 to 2011, the Bush tax cut would cost      $1.9 trillion, while the projected surpluses are $1.8      trillion. In fact, the Bush tax cuts' effects on the      surpluses are even greater than that. Besides, the official      surplus projections are substantially overstated because of      other factors, such as the adjustment for federal      appropriations and inflation, and without adjustment for      population growth or real wage growth. Thus, in far      likelihood, the Bush tax cuts would use up far more than the      likely surpluses over the next decade. That would require      dipping more heavily into social security and the Medicare      trust funds to cover the cost of the tax cuts.       Angela DeBlasio. The proposed tax cut by President Bush is      not only grossly unfair, fiscally irresponsible, and      economically ineffective, it would also do substantial harm      to long-term financial needs of Vermont. Under the Bush      proposal, a millionaire family would receive $40,000 in tax      break, while the average Vermont citizen making $40,000 will      received only $600. Despite a $5 trillion national debt and      the possibility of a recession around the corner, Republicans      are proposing radical and permanent changes in our tax code,      which will go into effect regardless of the future condition      of the economy and whether projected federal surpluses ever      materialize. While the Bush plan is bad for the nation, it is      also bad for Vermont. That is because our income tax code is      piggybacked on the federal tax code. It is projected that      Vermont would lose about $300 million over a ten-year period      if Bush's plans were enacted. That would translate into      higher property taxes, substantial cuts in education and      police protection, not to mention other needs.       Lynne Clough. The President argues that his plan would act      as a stimulus in the event of an economic downturn.      Congressman Sanders, this is not so. The Bush plan provides      most of the tax breaks in later years, which means they have      only a minor impact, if any, on the health of today's      economy. Furthermore, most economists believe a tax break for      the middle class are more likely to spend the money      immediately. This would have a greater impact on economy than      a tax break for the rich.       Angela DeBlasio. Congressman Sanders, we must not enact a      tax cut, especially one that is so incredibly large,      jeopardizes the funding of other important policies, and that      would return us to the days of deficit spending.       Lynne Clough. We also must not provide tax cuts that are      little more than welfare for the rich, as President Bush      would have us do. Therefore, we should not allow any form of      such a tax cut. Congressman Sanders, how can we even think      about a tax cut when President Bush is foolishly planing to      build a missile defense system, when we already have a      failing social security system, as well as a deteriorating      education system, which needs American tax dollars? Please      agree with us that there shouldn't be any form of a tax cut.       Angela DeBlasio. Democratic National Committee Chairman      Terry McGoffrey said a tax cut should be one that's fair to      all Americans, and must be part of a responsible, honest      budget that balances all of our priorities important to      American families. While Bush is predicting a recession to      sell his giant tax cut, he is simultaneously proposing to      slash the very initiatives that American families will need      if the economy does slow down. Bush's backward talk on the      economy and retrograde budget is a recipe for disaster.       Lynn Clough. Thank you, Congressman Sanders.                                 ____________________
