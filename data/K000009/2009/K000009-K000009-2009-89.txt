Speaker, our economy is far from healing. Economists believe that the proximate cause of our economic crisis is the housing foreclosure crisis. I agree. Thus, I want to help explain how the very banks the Executive Branch is bailing out have and continue to make money off our constituents through deceptive practices in the housing industry, specifically through the sale of those mortgages.  I have a constituent in Sandusky, Ohio, who refinanced his home due to a divorce to an adjustable rate mortgage through an Ohio bank. But then, J.P. Morgan Chase Bank in New York bought the bank and closed the deal on the refinancing of the mortgage. Chase did not properly disclose to this gentleman that the rates were higher than what was in the original loan documents, which violates the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Truth in Lending Act.  My constituent has paid and, to the best of my knowledge, is making regular payments on his mortgage to an escrow account; however, around last October, with the help of a lawyer, he served J.P. Morgan Chase a notice of rescission on his loan due to the aforementioned violations. His lawyer requested that Chase inform him of any interested parties and holders of his mortgage to properly notify them of his rescission. Chase has not properly answered his query, so the case is going to court.  It is the belief of my constituent's lawyer that Chase cannot name the holder of the mortgage. His loan was sold to a bank which placed his mortgage in a loan serving pool. Then his loan was chopped up into parts, bundled, and sold as mortgage-backed securities to hundreds of large institutional investors. Involved are trust oversight managers, depositors, underwriters, trust administrators, investors, trust fund issuing entities, trustees. But who really knows who all are involved? But we know this: They all got a piece of the pie on the transaction.  This loan pooling process, some would say a Ponzi scheme, for securitization of loans make one's head spin. But at its core is one thing: Lots of profit on the upside, and now lots of loss on the downside.  I do not know if my constituent can rescind his loan, avoid foreclosure, savehis credit rating and, therefore, his financial future, because he cannot properly notify the holder of the mortgage. No one knows who it is.  My constituent's situation is not unique, and in fact the story reverberates from sea to shining sea. We bailed out the banks because of these very practices which created certain toxic assets; yet, the practices continue: People lose their homes, the economy is tanking, and the bailed out banks are filling their coffers, paying dividends, making acquisitions, giving bonuses, holding auctions of these properties.  Furthermore, I would like to call your attention and include in the Record today's Wall Street Journal article titled, ``Lending Drops At Big US Banks.'' According to the article, 10 of the 13 biggest beneficiaries of bailout monies who received $148 billion of our taxpayer money saw their outstanding loan balances decline by a total of $46 billion between the third and fourth quarters of 2008. That means they weren't making loans with the money they got. The intent of bailing out Wall Street by those who voted for it was to free up credit. They didn't do it. And, Federal regulators are aiding and abetting them.  Rather than using the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Securities and Exchange Commission as the proper agency for mortgage resolution, what we continue to see is Treasury in charge, which is a revolving door between Wall Street and the highest levels of our government.  Paul Volcker put out a report last week on behalf of the Group of 13, calling for nations to reform their pro-cyclical regulatory and accounting rules. Unless this is done, why would our government allocate one more penny of taxpayer funds to cleaning up the mess that Wall Street and Washington leaders have gotten us into?             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 26, 2009]Lending Drops at Big U.S. Banks--Top Beneficiaries of Federal Cash Saw               Outstanding Loans Decline 1.4% Last Quarter                           (By David Enrich)       Lending at many of the nation's largest banks fell in      recent months, even after they received $148 billion in      taxpayer capital that was intended to help the economy by      making loans more readily available.       Ten of the 13 big beneficiaries of the Treasury      Department's Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, saw      their outstanding loan balances decline by a total of about      $46 billion, or 1.4%, between the third and fourth quarters      of 2008, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of banks      that recently announced their quarterly results.       Those 13 banks have collected the lion's share of the      roughly $200 billion the government has doled out since TARP      was launched last October to stabilize financial      institutions. Banks reporting declines in outstanding loans      range from giants Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc.,      each of which got $45 billion from the government; to      smaller, regional institutions. Just three of the banks      reported growth in their loan portfolios: U.S. Bancorp,      SunTrust Banks Inc. and BB&T Corp.       The loan figures analyzed by the Journal exclude some big      TARP recipients that haven't reported fourth-quarter results      yet, such as Wells Fargo & Co.       The overall decline in loans on the 13 banks' books--from      about $3.36 trillion as of Sept. 30 to $3.31 trillion at      year's end--raises fresh questions about TARP's effectiveness      at coaxing banks to reopen their lending spigots.       ``It has failed,'' said Campbell Harvey, a finance      professor at Duke University's business school. ``Basically      we have dropped a huge amount of money . . . and we have      nothing to show for what we actually wanted to happen.''                           Credit Constraints       In a survey last month of 569 U.S. companies, Mr. Harvey      and researchers at Duke and the University of Illinois found      that 59% felt constrained by a lack of credit. Many of those      firms are shelving expansion plans and cutting jobs as a      result of funding shortages, according to the survey, which      is expected to be released this week.       Bankers say it is unfair to expect them to funnel a large      portion of their government capital into loans so soon after      receiving it. They say it takes time to make prudent loans      and to attract new deposits that will allow them to lend out      their new capital efficiently.       Demand for low-risk loans is also ebbing as consumers and      businesses rein in their spending and try to conserve cash,      according to bank executives. Even though mortgage rates are      down, for example, applications in the week ended Jan. 16      declined about 10% from the previous week, according to the      latest data from the Mortgage Bankers Association.       Meanwhile, federal regulators have been pushing many banks      to set aside extra capital to cushion against losses. Bankers      say that is at odds with the government's encouragement to      make more loans.       The fact that loan portfolios are shrinking at many of the      largest TARP recipients underscores how few strings Treasury      Department officials attached to the infusions. That has made      it hard to prevent banks from using the money to pay      dividends, make acquisitions and fund bonuses for top      executives.       Federal officials argue that the downturn in lending would      have been much more acute without the TARP funding, and that      attaching additional strings to the money could have led      banks to make risky loans or to refuse to accept the      government capital.       Obama administration officials acknowledge that TARP hasn't      managed to jump start lending as intended, and say they plan      to overhaul the program to address the shortcomings. TARP      recipients must submit lending data to the Treasury      Department by the end of January, though industry officials      don't expect the disclosures to divulge much more than what      banks already include in routine regulatory filings.       Around the world, bankers are under pressure from      regulators and lawmakers struggling to prop up the financial      system. Politicians in the U.S. and overseas are ratcheting      up their rhetoric about banks needing to do their part. On      Sunday, Franz Muntefering, chairman of Germany's Social      Democrats, said in an interview with a German newspaper that      ``most of the bankers are competent and responsible, but      there are also some beatniks, pyromaniacs and gangsters.''                           New Student Loans       In a sign that banks are feeling political heat, Citigroup      is expected to announce Tuesday a plan to use some of its      TARP money to finance tens of billions of dollars in new      loans this year, according to people familiar with the      situation. The push will include credit cards, student loans      and mortgages aimed at specific segments of the population,      one person said.       Of the $45 billion it got from the government, Citigroup      last fall invested $10 billion in Fannie Mae's short-term      commercial paper, which the company views as relatively low      risk, according to the person familiar with the matter. The      remaining $35 billion hasn't been put to use yet.       Even critics of TARP's capital injections say that they      steadied financial institutions and soothed investors,      averting possible catastrophe. The first capital infusions      were announced about a month after Lehman Brothers Holdings      Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection, igniting fears that      other shaky financial companies could collapse.       The fourth-quarter decline in overall loan volume at the 13      banks coincides with an industry-wide retreat from broad      swaths of consumer lending. Banks have scaled back on      mortgage lending, canceled or substantially reduced many      home-equity and credit-card lines and, in some cases, simply      stopped making certain types of loans unless they're      guaranteed by the U.S. government.                             Recession Woes       Despite dismal economic conditions, many bankers insist      they are making every good loan that they can. Bank of      America and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., which got a combined $70      billion in government capital, said they originated a total      of $215 billion in loans in the fourth quarter. Their      combined loan portfolios shrank by about $28 billion in the      same period.       Scott Silvestri, a Bank of America spokesman, said the      Charlotte, N.C., bank's loan balances declined in part      because more borrowers have been paying off their debts. In      addition, ``there were fewer opportunities to make high-     quality loans because of the recession,'' he said. A      spokesman for J.P. Morgan declined to comment.       The loan volumes that banks disclose publicly only reflect      outstanding loans on their books, many originated years ago,      not the actual amount of new loans made in a given quarter.      While several banks reported the amount of new loans they      made in the fourth quarter, they didn't disclose comparable      figures from prior periods.       ``What you can't tell is how low they would have sunk in      the recession we're in were it not for the TARP money,'' said      Walter Moeling, a partner in the banking practice at law firm      Bryan Cave LLP.       The overall decline in loan balances during the fourth      quarter reflects the huge hurdles and conflicting agendas      that need to be overcome before credit can start flowing      smoothly again.       For instance, many banks have said they are using TARP      funds to cover current or anticipated defaults on a wide      variety of loans.       At the same time, shareholders at many institutions have      demanded that they slim down their balance sheets to reflect      the new risk-averse environment.       At BB&T, a Winston-Salem, N.C., bank that got $3.13 billion      from TARP, fourth-quarter lending volume rose about 2%, or $2      billion. While BB&T is making new loans, Chief Executive      Kelly King said the bank invested much of its taxpayer      capital as a way to earn a decent return while shunning risk.       ``We parked it there, and will redeploy it as quickly as we      can, not in a panic,'' Mr. King said last week on a      conference call with analysts. ``We're not going to make a      bunch of bad loans.''       The overall loan decline likely understates the magnitude      of the industry's retrenchment.       In normal times, banks would make loans and then sell many      off to investors or financial institutions. But that practice      has     ground to a halt, so more loans today are staying on banks'      books. As a result, some banks' loan portfolios could appear      larger than they would have in the past, even though they      aren't actually making more loans.       Bank balance sheets also have been inflated as more      companies draw on credit lines that banks committed to before      the financial crisis erupted. Last fall, an increasing number      of borrowers started tapping those lines, banks say, either      because other types of credit were evaporating or out of an      abundance of caution.       For example, KeyCorp, where total loan balances declined by      about $200 million in the fourth quarter, saw a $1.3 billion      leap in its commercial, financial and agricultural loans.      Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Weeden said that was      primarily the result of clients dipping into their revolving      lines.       KeyCorp, which is based in Cleveland and received $2.5      billion in federal capital, made or renewed $5.7 billion of      loans in the fourth quarter. But KeyCorp has stopped making      student loans unless they're backed by the U.S. government.                          ____________________
