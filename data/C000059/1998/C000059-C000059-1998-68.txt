Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a fallen police officer from Riverside, California. Officer Claire Connelly, who was an 18-month veteran of the force, is the first female Riverside police officer ever to be killed in the line of duty. She contributed generously of her time and talents to help others and to make her community a better place in which to live and work.  She was a bright, caring, and compassionate individual who made an everlasting impression in her short life. Claire Connelly went out every day to make a difference and she did--some days in small ways, some days in big ways, and on July 12, 1998, at the cost of her life. One cannot ask more of peace officers. Officer Connelly deserves our deepest respect and gratitude.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and our colleagues join me today in remembering this fine officer. On behalf of the residents of the 43rd Congressional District, I extend my prayers and most heartfelt sympathy to her family and loved ones.                          ____________________
