 President, I thank all Senators who worked very hard to get the Homeland Security appropriations bill completed. I thank Senator Cochran and Senator Byrd, managers of the bill. It has been a long process. We got a lot accomplished. We have one appropriations bill that we will now send to conference. I especially thank the staffs who spent long hours.  I ask unanimous consent to have their names printed in the Record and to thank them publicly.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                             Majority Staff     Charles Kieffer     Chip Walgren     Scott Nance     Drenan E. Dudley     Tad Gallion     Christa Thompson     Adam Morrison                             Minority Staff     Rebecca Davies     Carol Cribbs     Mark Van de Water                          ____________________
