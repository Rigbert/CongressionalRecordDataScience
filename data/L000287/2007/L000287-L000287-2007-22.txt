I appreciate very much my colleague yielding me this time. Very much I appreciate their making this effort to recognize and remember those people who lost their lives on 9/11 6 years ago.  I couldn't help, as I listened to the discussion today, to remember ironically that the Defense Subcommittee of Appropriations was meeting, with full membership from both sides of the aisle, just downstairs from the Chamber.  At the time the plane crashed in Pennsylvania in that open lot, with us was John Murtha of Pennsylvania. It was in his district where that plane crashed. The irony, as many know but I cannot help to mention it, that John Murtha is the chairman of the subcommittee at this very moment. At the time, we together recognized that the most important work of the Appropriations Committee perhaps takes place in that committee room, the Defense Subcommittee room.  And in this circumstance, when that plane crashed, which indeed likely was headed for the Capitol, that's the best speculation, if the Pennsylvania crash had hit the Capitol, we might very well have lost that entire committee. There are ironies in all of this.  As we remember those who lost their lives, let us remember the threat of terror to our very way of life is taking place around the world.
