Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a man and a moment in history. The U.S. Congress has been blessed by the vision and the faith of the Reverend Douglas Tanner, and we have been deeply moved by his invocation today.  Mr. Speaker, it takes wisdom to lead the leaders of men. It takes faith to hear the voice of the spirit through the rush and tumble of the U.S. Congress. But the Bible says that ``many are called, but few are chosen.''  God knew that the humility and the faith of Rev. Doug Tanner would serve as a powerful witness among us. As the founder and leader of the Faith and Politics Institute, he has led us on a moral mission. He has led us on a journey of the soul through meditation and prayer. He has led us through the pilgrimages through Alabama, Tennessee, and Virginia. He has helped to remind us that our faith is the key to all that we can accomplish here.  Mr. Speaker, when historians pick up their pens and write the story of this Congress in the latter part of the 20th century and the first part of the 21st century, they will have to say that one man, who was not chosen by men, but was chosen by God, led Democrats and Republicans, Members of the House and the Senate to understand that the way of peace, the way of love, the way of non-violence is the more excellent way.  Doug, we are deeply indebted to you for all that you have done to help build Beloved Community. We are deeply grateful for your vision, for your courage and your faith.                          ____________________
