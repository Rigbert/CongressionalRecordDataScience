It will enhance their ability to recruit and retain officers as they struggle to increase their strength while losing officers to other law enforcement agencies. All these changes in the amendment have been requested by the new Chief of Capitol Police, Terry Gainer, and the Capitol Police Board.  Let me say briefly how proud we are that Terry Gainer is the new Chief of Police. Those of us from Illinois and Chicago know Terry Gainer well. He is a former member of the Chicago Police, legal counsel for the Chicago Police Department, and superintendent of the Illinois State Police. He came to Washington, DC, was second in command in this the Capital City, and was then recruited to undertake this important responsibility. I am certain he is going to do an excellent, professional job considering the new challenges facing this department.  The new authorities in the amendment authorize them to hire new officers without regard to age. There are technical corrections to existing authorities regarding recruitment and relocation bonuses and premium pay for unscheduled overtime. It also includes technical corrections to the committee bill regarding the consolidated disbursing function for the Capitol Police, salaries, appropriations. All of those are technical in nature, and I urge the adoption of the amendment.
