President, I recently learned about a public statement by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture [CPT], concerning the problem of torture in Turkey. The CPT is a respected international organization established in1989, which visits prisons in countries that have ratified the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. All countries that have ratified the Convention agree to permit these visits, and presumably to pay attention to the Committee's recommendations.  The CPT publishes public statements only when states party to the Convention refuse to follow its recommendations. The group has only issued public statements on two occasions in its 8 years of existence. Both of these statements, the most recent of which was issued in December, discuss the ongoing problem of torture in Turkey.  The CPT acknowledges the serious threat of terrorism that Turkey faces and the security and humanitarian crises that have resulted, especially in the southeastern part of the country. The CPT also recognizes that the Government of Turkey has expressed concern about the use of torture and has responded by circulating memoranda and designing human rights programs for its law enforcement officials. However, the CPT concludes that in practice these measures, along with the legal framework to protect detainees from torture and ill-treatment and to discipline those who have used torture, are inadequate and ignored by Turkish authorities. A recent example is the decision by the Turkish Government to reduce to 4 days the length of time a suspect can be held incommunicado, without access to a lawyer. There is ample evidence that torture routinely occurs immediately following arrest. Any period of incommunicado detention is an invitation for these kinds of abuses to continue.  The facts contained in the CPT's December public statement are very troubling. In a September 1996 visit to prisons in Turkey, the CPT reported:       A considerable number of persons examined by the      delegation's three forensic doctors displayed marks or      conditions consistent with their allegations of recent ill-     treatment by the police, and in particular of beating of the      soles of the feet, blows to the palms of the hands and      suspension by the arms. The cases of seven persons . . . must      rank among the most flagrant examples of torture encountered      by CPT delegations in Turkey.  As in October 1994, the CPT again found ``material evidence of resort to ill-treatment, in particular, an instrument adapted in a way which would facilitate the infliction of electric shocks and equipment which could be used to suspend a person by the arms.''  Mr. President, this report shows that despite the Turkish Government's efforts in recent years, the practice of torture continues unabated. The latest State Department Country Reports on Human Rights, which was released on January 30, confirms this. It illustrates, once again, that good intentions and training programs, while important, are no substitute for holding people accountable. Only when people who engage in this abhorrent conduct believe they will be punished, will it stop.  This should concern us all, because Turkey is a valued NATO ally with which we have many shared interests. Turkey is going through a difficult period in its history, and I for one want to see our relationship strengthen. I raise these concerns because I believe that Turkey, and relations between our two countries, would benefit greatly if it were clear that vigorous, effective action were being taken to eradicate this curse.  I urge the administration and Members of Congress to raise the issue of torture at the highest levels of the Turkish Government, and to work with Turkish officials to pursue aggressively the necessary measures to end the practice of torture and the impunity that persist in Turkey today.                          ____________________
