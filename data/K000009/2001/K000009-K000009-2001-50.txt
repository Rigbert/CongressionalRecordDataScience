Speaker, tonight I would like to speak a bit about trading our freedom for oil.  Imported oil and the politics it attends have reared their ugly heads too often in modern history. Osama bin Laden's vengeance reveals its newest facet. President Jimmy Carter was right when he said that the Arab oil embargoes of the 1970s, and the economic havoc created here at home, constituted the moral equivalent of war. With public consciousness high at that time, our Nation created the Department of Energy to put America on a course to become more energy self-sufficient. Conservation saved millions of barrels per day, more fuel-efficient cars stemmed the growth of rising petroleum usage, and small efforts were made to develop alternative fuels.  But in reality, America was not really committed to a nonpetroleum future. By the 1990s, America had fallen asleep again. Foreign petroleum constituted half of U.S. consumption, with its share of total volume rising each year. Serious work on other fuel alternatives was largely ignored. Billions of dollars of U.S. tax subsidies continued to flow to the petroleum industry. Even the U.S. defense budget grew, including standing forces in Saudi Arabia, our largest supplier, to protect our foreign oil sources. By 2000, the U.S. imported over half of its petroleum, expending billions of dollars annually while foregoing that investment domestically.  The current recession, too, has been triggered by rising prices of imported petroleum. The U.S. engaged in the Persian Gulf War after Iraq invaded Kuwait to take over its oil fields. No longer working through surrogate heads of state like the Shah of Iran, the United States became directly embroiled in Middle East oil politics in that war. Then the subsequent, decade-long U.S. containment bombing of Iraq's no-fly zones ensued. What an irony of modern history, that as our Nation bombs Iraq, we continue to purchase billions of dollars of Iraqi petroleum. Meanwhile, in Saudi Arabia, 5,000 U.S. troops have been stationed to regularly defend the trade path for U.S.-bound oil out of the Straits of Hormuz and into the Arabian Sea headed to our shores.  Now America is at war again. This time our enemies are oil kingdom zealots whose wrath grows out of the very undemocratic regimes that weaned them. In these places, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Yemen, even Sudan, oil trade over the decades has not brought freedom nor democracy. Trillions of U.S. consumer dollars have flowed to the oil kingdoms and yielded unrepresentative governments, some tyrants, great poverty, poor education, gender bias and political instability. Indeed, trade without freedom has yielded a virulent hate towards America, equal to that directed against the oil kingdoms themselves.                              {time}  1730  America must remove oil as a distorting proxy for our foreign policy. America can do this. It will take Presidential leadership and the leadership of this Congress, the kind of leadership less allied to the Carlyle Group and more allied to America's independence.  As a consumer, I want to purchase an ethanol-powered car. Even though Detroit makes such a car, I cannot buy fuel for it at the pump. The oil industry has a lock on fuel sold to American consumers. But every time I buy a gallon of gas, I am angry because I know half of my money flows offshore into the pockets of cartels in undemocratic regimes.  The American people must be freed to purchase a broader range of fuels. The lock of the cartels on our gas pumps must be broken. The Government of the United States should employ its antitrust powers to free our consumers at the pump, free us to purchase the fuel of our choice. For me it is ethanol produced by farmers in the Midwest. Let me buy it.  Putting America on a solid energy footing will require national leadership, and our Federal Government must spur America forward, akin to the dawn of the space age and the establishment of NASA.  We must demonstrate will here at home first. Becoming energy self-sufficient makes global economic sense too, because over the next 15 years world oil reserves will begin diminishing, with prices rising even higher with each barrel pumped.  There is no more opportune time for our Nation to get serious. Let us free America from its dependence on foreign petroleum.                          ____________________
