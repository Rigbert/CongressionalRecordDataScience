Everybody is going to have the right to see what evidence is adduced.  That is the fear, of course, and I again suggest the gentleman think of this: If he saw these headlines and it was a Democratic President and Turkey and Russia were deciding what is happening in the Middle East and deciding whether they are going to go after ISIS, our ally, and then this other headline replete with the aid to Ukraine was conditioned on a quid pro quo or they weren't going to be in the White House, they may not get the $391 million, he would be outraged. He would be on this ceiling.
