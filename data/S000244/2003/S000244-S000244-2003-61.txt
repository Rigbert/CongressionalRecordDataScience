Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, news stories extolling the successful use of DNA to solve crimes abound. Consider the following: in 1999, New York authorities linked a man through DNA evidence to at least 22 sexual assaults and robberies that had terrorized the city. In 2002, authorities in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Fort Collins, Colorado, used DNA evidence to link and solve a series of crimes perpetrated by the same individual. In the State of Washington during 2001, DNA evidence provided a major breakthrough of the ``Green River'' killings, a series of crimes that had remained unsolved for years despite a large law enforcement task force and a $15 million investigation.  DNA is generally used to solve crimes in one of two ways. In cases where a suspect is identified, a lawfully obtained sample of that person's DNA can be compared to evidence from the crime scene. The results of this comparison may help establish whether the suspect committed the crime. In cases where a suspect has not yet been identified, biological evidence from the crime scene can be analyzed and compared to offender profiles in DNA databases to help identify the perpetrator.  DNA evidence has also been used successfully to free individuals who have been wrongfully convicted. In my home State of Wisconsin, one such individual, Steven Avery, was exonerated by DNA evidence after serving more than 17 years in the Stanley Correctional Institution in Chippewa County for a sexual assault and attempted murder he did not commit. He was released last month, by the same judge who sentenced him in 1986, after DNA tests exonerated him. Evidence collected from the victim was determined to belong to another inmate, who is serving time for a different sexual assault.  In the late 1980s, the Federal Government laid the groundwork for a system of national, State, and local DNA databases for the storage and exchange of DNA profiles. This system, called the Combined DNA Index System, CODIS for short, maintains DNA profiles obtained under Federal, State, and local systems in a series of databases that are available to law enforcement agencies across the country for law enforcement purposes only. Currently, all 50 States and the Federal Government have laws requiring that DNA samples be collected from some categories of offenders for inclusion in CODIS. Evidence from a crime scene can be linked to other crime scenes through the use of the CODIS database to identify repeat offenders or serial criminals. CODIS can be used to compare crime scene evidence to a database of DNA profiles obtained from convicted offenders.  We are fortunate to have this tool available to ensure accuracy and fairness in our criminal justice system. It has the potential to make our great justice system even better. However, if DNA samples are not tested, or not entered into the databases, that potential is completely wasted. Sadly, the reality is that many samples are not being tested or recorded in the database. To have this tool available and not to fully use it is tragic. Many crimes could be solved, many guilty people could be taken off the streets, and many victims could be spared from further crimes.  Despite DNA's enormous potential, the current Federal and State DNA collection and analysis system suffers from a variety of problems. In many instances, public crime labs are overwhelmed by backlogs of unanalyzed DNA samples, samples that could be used to solve violent crimes if the States had the funds to eliminate this backlog. Some estimates indicate that DNA evidence from at least 300,000 rape crime scenes have been collected but never analyzed in a crime lab. In addition, many of the labs are ill equipped to handle the increasing flow of DNA samples and evidence.  The problems of backlogs and the lack of up-to-date technology result in significant delays in the administration of justice. The system needs more research to develop faster methods to analyze DNA evidence. Legal and medical personnel need additional timing and assistance in order to ensure the optimal use of DNA evidence to solve crimes and assist victims. The criminal justice system needs the means to provide DNA testing in appropriate circumstances for individuals who assert that they have been wrongly convicted.  This legislation, cosponsored by 250 Members of the House, will help eliminate these problems. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation authorizes $755 million over 5 years to eliminate the current backlog of rape kits and other crime scene evidence awaiting DNA analysis in crime labs.  It authorizes funding for training for law enforcement, correctional, court, and medical personnel on the use of DNA evidence. H.R. 3214 funds research to improve forensic technology and authorizes $10 million per year in grants to States, local governments, and tribal governments to eliminate forensic backlogs. It also authorizes funding for the use of forensic DNA technology to identify missing persons and unidentified human remains. Most of these provisions are part of the President's DNA initiative.  H.R. 3214 also seeks to prevent wrongful convictions. The Innocence Protection Act provisions of H.R. 3214, which are also the result of bipartisan and bicameral negotiations, will ensure that our justice system is working. They establish rules for post-DNA testing of Federal prison inmates and require the preservation of biological evidence in Federal criminal cases where the defendant remains incarcerated. These provisions also authorize funding to help States to provide competent legal services for both the prosecution and the defense in death penalty cases. They provide funds for postconviction DNA testing and bonus grants to States that adopt adequate procedures for providing postconviction DNA testing and preserving biological evidence.  This legislation came out of the Committee on the Judiciary by a vote on 28 to 1. After that vote, a few Members raised concerns about the new grant program in title III which provides grants to States which put an effective system in place for appointing and compensating attorneys in capital cases. Members from States that already have a system established by statute felt that those States should be eligible to receive these grants for improving both prosecution and defense training. Along with a few other technical tweaks, the manager's amendment allows those States to be eligible for these grants.  Additionally, the manager's amendment provides improvements to the CODIS and NDIS databases by allowing DNA samples which have been lawfully collected, other than from arrestees or voluntary samples, to be entered into CODIS. DNA samples from arresteesmay be analyzed for a match in the database but may not be retained. This distinction provides a balance between protecting individual rights and ensuring that law enforcement has the tools it needs to solve crimes. I think States like Louisiana, which recently had to track down a serial killer, can appreciate the importance of this change in the law.  Finally, I would like to respond to a couple of the complaints that I have heard about this legislation. I have heard that this bill funds advocacy for those who are opposed to capital punishment. That is not the case at all. The legislation specifically prohibits the direct or indirect use of grant funds for representation in a particular case, and the report language further specifies that grants cannot be used for advocacy.  Finally, I heard some complaints from people who support capital punishment that the innocent protection provisions in this bill will make it more difficult for the death penalty to be imposed upon those who have been convicted and have exhausted their appeals. Let me say that I am a supporter of capital punishment; and unless we use the most modern technology to make sure that those who are convicted are indeed guilty, and those who are not guilty are not put to death, sooner or later the Supreme Court will accept the invitation and declare capital punishment per se a violation of the Constitution.  I believe that this bill is something that death penalty supporters should be supporting because it will provide for a greater degree of accuracy in making sure that those who are convicted of a crime and sentenced to death by a jury in those States which do allow for capital punishment are truly guilty.  I believe that we have crafted a bill that will do much to assist law enforcement in solving crimes and ensuring that the right people are convicted. I urge my colleagues to recognize the benefit of this legislation and vote in favor of its passage today.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1045
