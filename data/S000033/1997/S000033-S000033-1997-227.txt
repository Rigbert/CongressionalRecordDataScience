 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by a high school student from Champlain Valley High School in Vermont, who was speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       Mr. Olson. Yes, hello. I am here today, Representative      Sanders and classmates, to talk about an issue that is very      pressing for most of us high school students, the increase in      college financing and the troubles around it.       If we look at the last ten years, since 1995 actually, at      the money that has been put into the cost of college      financing it has for the most part stayed the same.      Government funding toward financial assistance has for the      most part stayed the same. I know there was in a projected      budget next year a $27 million increase, but that is not--for      a national figure that is not a large increase whereas the      costs of going to college since 1985 have been 2\1/2\ times      that of inflation which is over 10 percent.       If you look at the people who applied for financial aid in      the 1985 and received the funds compared to what their      tuition costs were and then did a cost comparison today, the      comparison will be hard to make. We need to increase      educational funding at the equal rate of the rising college      expenses if we plan to send students who are talented and      motivated, ambitious and want to go to college. And I think      it is the duty of the Government to not necessarily directly      fund but at least provide a means so that a student who is      college bound in the sense, literal sense that he is able to      go to college.       I know that finance is certainly a contributing factor to a      college decision, but in 1985 there were students who were      deciding to go to one university or college over another      because of financial reasons and there is nothing wrong with      that competition, but now it has become not just a persuading      factor, but I know there are a lot of students who apply to      college and are forced to go to universities or colleges      strictly because of unmet financial need, and I am curious      about how we plan to remedy that situation.       I think that any student who has the potential to be a      college graduate and is unable to finance their way there      should not be held back, and it needs to be allowed and the      Federal Government is certainly involved in that as it is      now, but needs to allow it to happen, whether it needs to      come out of their budget or needs to come out of a      program.       There is a difference there because pleasure and--I do not      want to say extra things, postsecondary school but a higher      education right now is not a right, it is not, but I think it      needs to be considered that we should not as a nation, not      just the Government but as a nation discriminate against the      less financially advantaged.       My problem is that my kids are smarter than yours, they      work harder than yours, and they are being born into a life      that is less fortunate and it is a cycle that has been      repeating in this Nation for a long period of time and needs      to stop.       I think that they should invest in me because I am an      investment that is going to pay off and I am going to pay for      their Social Security and I am going to undoubtedly--I mean,      the students who are going to go to college have put in the      hard work and are going to graduate are not just--I mean that      money is not disappearing, it is being invested.       In the last 10 or so years a lot of these programs, like      corporate welfare, national defense, they have not stayed the      same and there have been in the last--if you look at the last      10 years every year there has been slight increases,      increases, increases, and I want to know why those same      moneys didn't go to VSAC Program and TRIO?       There has to be initiative taken because while these things      were increasing, they were increasing with inflation so in      order to have the military and the corporate welfare slowly      increase year to year it is sort of like putting it on      autopilot in some ways.       They were going up every year and that was actually      considered traditional, regular, accepted where it should      have stayed the same, so someone had to have gone out of      their way to make the initiative to make sure it didn't grow.                               ____________________
