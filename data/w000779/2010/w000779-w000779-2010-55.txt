President, today the Senate has passed legislation that will make a historic investment in our children by approving the first increase in real terms of the reimbursement rate for school lunches in 40 years.  Now 10,000 children a year will have new access to free school meals. Throughout the country, there are people working hard to make sure these kids have a least one healthy meal each day. In my State, one of the people who makes that happen is Betty Brain of the Blazers Boys and Girls Club in Portland. She is known as Chef Betty and every day she cooks meals for more than 200 underserved kids, dishing up healthy foods with fresh ingredients to keep them healthy and strong.  Chef Betty is not just a cook. She is an inspiration to the kids who come to the Boys and Girls Club every day. These kids are family to her, and she makes it her personal responsibility to make sure they get not only a good meal but also a kind word and a helping hand.  I can guarantee that there is a Chef Betty in every Boys and Girls Club in America--someone who understands how important it is to help a child in whatever way she can.  For all the Chef Bettys in America, we need to reauthorize these programs so they can keep those kids from being forced into eating not just any food but good food made by good people.
