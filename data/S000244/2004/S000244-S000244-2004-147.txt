Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, to begin, let me associate myself with the remarks of the gentleman from California. He is dead right in saying that an investment in groups like these will pay off in saving a big bundle of money, of the costs of dealing with kids who get in trouble. These types of prevention programs and effectively giving an outlet for young people to associate with one another during afterschool and weekend activities is something that should be encouraged because it is cost-effective.  But I would like to add one other point in response to the comments of my good friend from Arizona. If this bill is voted down today, the money will go to the Boys and Girls Clubs anyhow because the appropriators will continue to fund those requests through the State-Justice-Commerce appropriation bill. Voting down this bill is not going to stop the appropriators from appropriating money to the Boys and Girls Clubs. The way that it gets stopped is the defeat of the relevant appropriation bill.  But if the authorization for the Boys and Girls Clubs is permitted to expire, then the authorizing committees, the Judiciary Committee in this House and the other body, will lose a valuable tool to do oversight over the Boys and Girls Clubs to make sure that this money is being effectively spent. Unauthorized programs are basically oversight-free programs. The consequence of the gentleman from Arizona, while well-intentioned, succeeding in bringing this bill down is going to mean less congressional oversight over how this money is being spent. That is a step backwards, and that is why this bill ought to pass.  Mr. Speaker, I ask for an ``aye'' vote.
