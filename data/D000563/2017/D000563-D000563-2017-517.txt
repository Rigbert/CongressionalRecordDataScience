President, I listened carefully to the statement by the Republican leader on the floor, and I am hoping we can reach some agreement later today as to the nominations to be considered this day and very quickly next week. I will, for the record, make it clear that the seven nominees who moved through on the first day of the Obama administration were people who had their ethics statements filed on time, had filed all the legally required papers on time for review.  Unfortunately, that is not the case for all of the nominees by the new Trump administration. Some of them bring to this nomination some extraordinarily challenging financial data, and because of their companies, because of their lifestyles, because of their wealth, it takes longer to go through these documents than it does for people of modest means. When we proposed, by the Obama administration, Penny Pritzker, of Chicago, to serve as Secretary of Commerce, it took 6 months to clear the paperwork on her financial background.
