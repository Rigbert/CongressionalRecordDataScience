I would also point out that Mr. Crane's office unsealed the indictment in a responsible way. According to information I received, the Special Court's chief of security was instructed to inform all organizations with personnel in Liberia, including the U.S. Embassy, Freetown, that ``within 24 hours the Special Court was going to take an action that could possibly destabilize Monrovia.'' These actions were undertaken to ensure that all government and humanitarian personnel had notice to withdraw or stay home.  This effectively ``unsealed'' the indictment to governments and humanitarian organizations without tipping Mr. Taylor off. In addition, 3 hours before the press conference and public announcement, and minutes after the Court had confirmation that Ghanaian authorities were served with the arrestwarrant for Mr. Taylor, private letters were hand-delivered to all representatives of a number of key governments in Freetown.
