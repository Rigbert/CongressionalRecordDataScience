Speaker, I rise in enthusiastic support of H.R. 1596, the Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 1997.  Spurred by credit card debt, bankruptcy claims in the United States have escalated by more than 20 percent over the past 5 years, increasing from 971,000 in 1992 to 1.2 million in 1996. This has translated into expanding caseloads for U.S. bankruptcy courts and placed a substantial added burden upon bankruptcy judges and staff. The district of Maryland is among those jurisdictions affected most severely by the rise in bankruptcy filings, experiencing a staggering 35.8 percent jump in the last year, and an astounding 544 percent increase over the 12-year period beginning December 31, 1984, and ending December 31, 1996.  The Bankruptcy Judgeship Act will help to alleviate the mounting stress on the most severely overburdened U.S. bankruptcy courts by establishing an additional 7 permanent and 11 temporary bankruptcy judgeships in various jurisdictions around the country. Under H.R. 1596, Maryland would receive one permanent and two temporary bankruptcy judgeships.  I would like to commend the bill's lead sponsor, Mr. Gekas, chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative law, and the rest of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, including Chairman Henry Hyde, ranking member John Conyers, and the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. Nadler, for taking this action to help bankruptcy courts meet the challenge of rapidly expanding caseloads.  Enactment of this legislation will bring much-needed relief to the U.S. bankruptcy court system and more expeditious adjudication of bankruptcy claims. I strongly encourage all of my colleagues to support this important and timely legislation.
