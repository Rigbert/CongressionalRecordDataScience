President, I rise today to engage my colleague from Michigan, the sponsor of the Child Custody Protection Act, in a colloquy to clarify the legislation's intent with regard to existing State parental notification laws.  The State of Maine has a carefully constructed adult consent requirement. In my state, a minor under 18 may obtain an abortion with the informed consent of either one parent, a guardian or an adult family member. Absent that consent, she may obtain an abortion if she receives counseling from a physician, psychiatrist, ordained member of the clergy, nurse, physician's assistant or qualified counselor. She may also obtain an abortion without parental or adult family member consent by securing a court order.  Will the legislation we are considering today in any way override or supersede Maine State law?
