 President, earlier today there were some comments about the Minnesota Senate race that I would like to briefly address. The only people who have pronounced the Minnesota Senate race over are Washington Democrats and the candidate who is the current custodian of the most votes. The people of Minnesota certainly do not believe the Minnesota Senate race is over. The Minneapolis Star Tribune, which never could be confused for a conservative publication, wrote an editorial in their paper today entitled, ``Court Review is Key in Senate Recount.''  Writing about yesterday's Canvassing Board findings, the editorial says--and again, this is in today's Minneapolis Star Tribune--the editorial today says:       As Minnesotans are learning, that determination is not the      same as declaring a winner in this amazingly close race.  It went on to say:       Both Franken and Coleman should want court-ordered answers      to questions that the Canvassing Board could not answer.       The winner of this contest deserves the legitimacy that      would come with a court's politically independent finding      that he got more votes than his opponent.  The bottom line is this: The Senate race in Minnesota will be determined by Minnesotans, not here in the Senate.                          ____________________
