  I suppose there is not a single Member of this body, I would say to the majority leader, who has been very consistent on this subject. Sometimes Members have felt that sanctions were inappropriate except in their particular area of interest where they thought sanctions might make sense. I confess to being entirely inconsistent, too, myself, I say to my friend from Mississippi, having supported sanctions in South Africa and opposed them in China and other places. So none of us have a consistent pattern here.  I think it is very important to try to pull together the best thinking available from Senators on both sides of the aisle to see whether there is some kind of coherent way to go forward in this field.  So I thank the majority leader for his understanding of the importance to try to pull us together in this complicated area. And I assure him I will do my best to try to give everybody an opportunity to have their say. And we will certainly meet the deadlines. I say to the distinguished majority leader, the deadlines will be met, with or without consensus, I cannot say at this point. But I look forward to working on this assignment. I thank the majority leader for the opportunity.
