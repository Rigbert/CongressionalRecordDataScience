I also believe, in Illinois, as I travel around and speak to families and businesses, there is one consuming issue, and that is the cost of health care, the cost of health insurance. Small businesses see these dramatic increases in health insurance premiums, and with these increases they are faced with the terrible prospect of either reducing or eliminating coverage for their employees; that has, unfortunately, led to more and more uninsured Americans.  Is it not true that, given the chance on the floor, with the prescription drug bill, where the Bush administration could have stepped forward and spoken for these families and businesses and said to pharmaceutical companies that you have to, as Canada has done, restrain drug price increases, is it not true that on this issue relating directly to the competitiveness of American products, the welfare of American families, and the future of businesses and jobs, that this administration has once again caved in to the special interest groups--the drug companies and HMOs in this case--at the expense of the American economy?
