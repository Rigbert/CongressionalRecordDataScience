Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks.  Mr. Speaker, in that spirit, I will ask for a moment of silence. But before I do that, let me mirror the remarks of the leader on the other side of the aisle.  A moment of silence will not be enough to respect the life of Elijah Cummings. What will be enough is we follow his example for a lifetime--not for a moment, but for a lifetime--if we give one another the respect that he would give to us, if we give one another the consideration that the leader indicated that he gave to him.  So, Mr. Speaker, I ask that we stand for a moment of silence and a lifetime of following an example.
