The Senator from Oklahoma has a good intent, but he is adding in a payment limit on top of two others. It is going to be difficult to implement and administrate from the Department of Agriculture's standpoint. The Senator from Michigan is exactly right. He is limiting programs for which there probably will not be any programs. I suggest we do this during the reauthorization of the farm bill, and then I would encourage the Senator to come at that particular time and figure out what is in the farm bill and what is not, what payment limitation is appropriate and what is not.
