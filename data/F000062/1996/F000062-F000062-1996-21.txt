 President, I oppose the override of the veto of H.R. 1833, a bill banning emergency late-term abortions.  This bill is unnecessary. It is an unprecedented intrusion by the Federal Government into medical decision-making and it represents a direct constitutional challenge to safe and legal abortion as protected under the Roe versus Wade Supreme Court decision which has been the law of the land for 23 years.  There are several reasons why this is a flawed bill.  First, this bill attempts to ban a specific medical procedure, called by opponents, partial-birth abortion, but there is no medical definition of ``partial-birth abortion.''  Second, the language in this bill is so vague that it could affect far more than the one particular procedure it seeks to ban. As such, it undermines Roe versus Wade.  Third, there is no exception to protect the health of the woman. This bill would be a blanket ban on the use of a type of medical procedure regardless of whether it is the safest procedure under a particular set of circumstances.  Fourth, this bill presumes guilt on the part of the doctor and forces physicians to prove that they did not violate the law.  Fifth, this bill is unnecessary Federal regulation, since 41 States have already outlawed postviability abortions except to save a woman's life or health.  Sixth, this is an ineffective bill because most cases not affected by it.   no medical term for partial-birth abortion; doctors vulnerable to                               prosecution  H.R. 1833 seeks to outlaw a medical procedure called, by the bill, partial-birth abortion. This procedure does not appear in medical textbooks. It does not appear in the medical records of doctors who are said to have performed this procedure.  The doctors who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee could not identify, with any degree of certainty or consistency, what medical procedure this legislation refers to.  For example, when asked to describe in medical terms what a ``partial-birth abortion'' is, Dr. Pamela Smith, director of ob/gyn medical education at Mt. Sinai Hospital in Chicago called it ``* * * a perversion of a breech extraction.''  Dr. Nancy Romer, a practicing ob/gyn and assistant professor at Wright State University School of Medicine, who said the doctors at her hospital had never performed the procedure, had to quote another doctor in describing it as ``a Dilation and Extraction, distinguished from dismemberment-type D&Es.''  When the same question was posed to legal experts in the Judiciary Committee hearings--to define exactly what medical procedure would be outlawed by this legislation--the responses were equally vague.  The vagueness of exactly what medical procedures would be criminalized under this bill is striking and it may be vague for very deliberate reasons.  By leaving the language vague every doctor that performs even a second trimester abortion could face the possibility of prosecution under this law.  Senator Hatch said in our previous debate that every woman testifying in the committee who thought they were testifying about a ``partial birth abortion,'' were not affected by this legislation.  This is evidence of the confusing and nonspecific nature of this so-called partial birth procedure.             this bill could affect other legal procedures  The language in this bill is so vague that, far from outlawing just one, particular abortion procedure, the way this bill is written virtually any abortion procedure could fall within its scope.  I asked the legal and medical experts who testified at the Judiciary Committee hearing if this legislation could affect abortion--not just late-term abortions--but earlier abortions of nonviable fetuses as well.  Dr. Louis Seidman, professor of law from Georgetown University, gave the following answer:       As I read the language, in a second trimester pre-viability      abortion where the fetus will in any event die, if any      portion of the fetus enters the birth canal prior to the      technical death of the fetus, then the physician is guilty of      a crime and goes to prison for 2 years.  Dr. Seidman continued his testimony concluding that:       If I were a lawyer advising a physician who performed      abortions, I would tell him to stop because there is just no      way to tell whether the procedure will eventuate in some      portion of the fetus entering the birth canal before the      fetus is technically dead, much less being able to      demonstrate that after the fact.  Dr. Courtland Richardson, associate professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, in testimony before a House committee, said,       [the language] ``partially vaginally delivers'' is vague,      not medically oriented, and just not correct.       In any normal 2nd trimester abortion procedure by any      method, you may have a point at which a part, a one inch      piece of [umbilical] cord for example, of the fetus passes      out of the cervical [opening] before fetal demise has      occurred.  So, contrary to proponents' claims, this bill could affect far more than just the few abortions performed in the third trimester, and far more than just the one procedure being described.                  presumes guilt; affirmative defense  Another troubling aspect of this legislation to me is that it violates a fundamental tenet of our legal system--the presumption of innocence. This bill does exactly the opposite--it presumes guilt.  This legislation provides what is known as affirmative defense--whereby an accused physician could escape liability only by proving that he or she ``reasonably believed'' that the banned procedure--whatever that procedure proves to be--was necessary to save the woman's life and that no other procedure would have sufficed.  It also opens the door to prosecution of doctors for almost any abortion by forcing them to prove they did not violate a law that can be interpreted in many, many different ways.                          no health exception  This legislation has no exemption or protection for the health of the mother and, as such, would directly eliminate that protection provided by the Supreme Court in Roe versus Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey.  If this legislation were law, a pregnant woman seriously ill with diabetes, cardiovascular problems, cancer, stroke, or other health-threatening illnesses would be forced to carry the pregnancy to term or run the risk that the physician could be challenged and have to prove in court what procedure he used, and whether or not the abortion ``partially vaginally-delivered'' a living fetus before death of that fetus.  It is also important to point out that, on the extremely rare occasions when a third trimester abortion is performed, it is virtually always in cases where there is severe fetal abnormality or a major health threat to the mother. This procedure is less risky for the mother than other procedures--such as a cesarean delivery, induced labor, or a saline abortion--because there is less maternal blood loss, less risk of uterine perforation, less operating time--thus cutting anesthesia needs--and less trauma to the mother. Trauma, for example, can lead to an incompetent cervix which can cause repeated pregnancy loss.  The sad fact is, while our technology allows many genetic disorders to be detected early in pregnancies, all cannot be detected.  While many women undergo sonograms and other routine medical examinations in the earliest weeks of pregnancy to monitor fetal development, and, if a woman is over 35 yearsof age, she may undergo amniocentesis, these tests are not routine for women under 35 because of the potential risk to the fetus with amniocentesis, plus the additional cost involved.  Ultrasound testing would provide further early detection of fetal anomalies, but these tests also are not routinely used until late pregnancy. As a result, some women carry fetuses with severe birth defects late into the pregnancy without knowing it.  According to obstetricians, some of the severe fetal anomalies that would cause a woman to end a pregnancy at this late stage are tragic: Cases where the brain forms outside the skull; cases where the stomach and intestines form outside the body or do not form at all; fetuses with no eyes, ears, mouths, legs, or kidneys--sometimes, tragically, unrecognizable as human at all.  But even with advanced technology, many serious birth defects can only be identified later, often in the third trimester or when the fetus reaches a certain size.  Anomalies such as hydrocephaly may not even be detected with an early ultrasound examination.  Other abnormalities such as polyhydramnios--too much amniotic fluid--does not occur until the third trimester--and may require an abortion.  The delivery of these babies can often endanger the mother's life.  The families who face these unexpected tragedies do not make hasty or careless decisions about their options.  In addition to the obstetrician, they seek second and third opinions, often consulting specialists, including perinatalogists, genetic counselors, pediatric cardiologists, and pediatric neurosurgeons--who explore every available option to save this baby that they very much want.  The Federal Government has no place interfering, making this tragic situation any more difficult or complicated for these families.    ROE VERSUS WADE ALREADY ALLOWS STATES TO BAN LATE-TERM ABORTIONS  Why is this legislation even necessary?  Roe versus Wade unequivocally allows States to ban all postviability abortions unless they are necessary to protect a woman's life or health. Forty-one States have already done so.  The whole focus of this Congress has been to give power and control back to the States and getting the Federal Government out of people's lives.  Surely anyone who believes in States' rights must question the logic of imposing new Federal regulation on States in a case such as this, in areas where States have already legislated.                        most cases not affected  As drafted, this bill is meaningless under the Constitution's commerce clause, because it would only apply to patients or doctors who cross State lines in order to perform an abortion under these circumstances.  The vast majority of cases would even be affected by this law. So what is the point?  The point is that this legislation has little or nothing to do with stopping the use of some horrific and unnecessary medical procedure being performed by evil or inhumane doctors.  If that were the case we would all be opposed.                               conclusion  This is a vague, poorly constructed, badly intended bill.  It attempts to ban a medical procedure without properly identifying that procedure in medical terms.  It is so vague that it could affect far more than the procedure it seeks to ban.  It presumes guilt on the part of the doctor.  And it ignores the vital health interests of women who face tragic complications in their pregnancies.  But the strongest reason to vote against this bill, in my view, is that it is not the role of the Federal Government to make medical decisions.  I urge my colleagues to vote to sustain the President's veto.
