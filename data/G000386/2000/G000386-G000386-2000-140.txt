 President, I rise today to introduce the Civil Rights Tax Fairness Act of 2000. I am being joined by Senator Robb in this effort. Civil rights legislation has been in force throughout this country for nearly thirty years; its purpose being to provide real remedies to victims of discrimination.  The Civil Rights Tax Fairness Act restores certain remedies for victims of discrimination by eliminating taxes on emotional distress awards. This tax was incorporated into the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, making the taxation of awards received in discrimination cases involving back wages or non-physical injuries ( including emotional distress) taxable. The result of the 1996 legislation was to discriminate against people involved in civil rights cases. People who received damage awards because of a bar-room brawl or slip-and-fall incident, often caused by simple negligence, get tax free awards. While, for similar types of psychological injuries caused by intentional discrimination the damages are taxed. The result of this taxation is that the attorneys and government make out better than the victims who had their rights violated.  A second part of The Civil Rights Tax Fairness Act changes the current law, which requires people who receive back pay awards in discrimination cases to be bumped up into a higher tax bracket. When back pay awards are received by a person in a case the IRS considers it taxable income to be taxed in the year it is received, even though the award received covers many years of lost wages. Currently no averaging of back pay awards is allowed, but The Civil Rights Tax Fairness Act attempts to address this problem. The act provides for income averaging of back pay awards, making it possible for the award to be taxed over the number of years it was meant to compensate.  The third area that The Civil Rights Fairness Act attempts to combat is the double taxation of attorneys' fees that takes place under current law. Presently individuals who receive awards end up having to include in that award their attorneys' fee. This fee can end up being larger than the actual award received by the plaintiff. The current tax implications in the law require the plaintiff to pay taxes on their award and on the attorneys fees received by their lawyer.  One real life example recently brought to my attention involves an Iowa citizen named Don Lyons. Mr. Lyons, a man attempting to do the honorable thing by helping out a co-worker with filing a sex discrimination complaint against their employer, was unjustly retaliated against. After prevailing in court and receiving a $15,000 remitted judgment, Mr. Lyons then had to deal with the present tax laws, which not only devoured his judgment, but required him to actually pay thousands of more dollars to the government in taxes.  First, Mr. Lyons had to pay taxes on the $15,000 he received as punitive damages from his employer. After he pays his taxes he is left with $9,533. However, when Mr. Lyons takes into account the taxes that he has to pay on the combination of his settlement and attorneys' fees, he ends up owing $67,791 in taxes. When you subtract the $9,533 Mr. Lyons had left from the initial judgment he ends up still owing the government $58,236 in taxes. Mr. Lyons attorney, Ms. Victoria L. Herring, also has to pay taxes on the fee she received for taking Mr. Lyons case. Mr. Lyons ends up paying taxes on money that he never even received, making him a good example of why it is important to pass The Civil Rights Tax Fairness Act and end double taxation. Everyone should agree that this is a extreme example of unfair taxation.  Mr. Lyons helped out a co-worker, was attacked by his employer, and received damages in a court of law. People count on the legal system to protect them and when their civil rights are violated the system needs to function properly. It is disheartening to learn that, in actuality, Mr. Lyons is going to be taken to the cleaners by the government tax system, and as a result, he ends up owing $58,236 to the government for the ``privilege'' of having won his retaliation case.  It seems to me that there is something fundamentally wrong with the law when it hurts the people it is supposed to protect. This being said, it is time to change the mistakes made in the past by passing the Civil Rights Tax Fairness Act 2000. This bill will go a long way toward helping out victims of discrimination by eliminating taxes on emotional distress awards, ending lump-sum taxation, and ending double taxation. The changing of the law will have positive effects on citizens like Mr. Lyons, allowing similar victims to keep more of their awards. At the same time, it will be beneficial for business, since they will be able to settle discrimination claims for lower settlements.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record after my remarks the letter I received from Mr. Lyon's attorney, Victoria L. Herring. Ms. Herring does an outstanding job of quantifying and personalizing the importance of the Civil Rights Tax Fairness Act.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                November 30, 1999.     Re Tax implications of civil rights litigation.     Senator Charles Grassley,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Senator Tom Harkin,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators: I write you as an attorney of long-standing      in Des Moines and an Iowa citizen who represents other Iowans      in employment-related matters. I write to bring to your      attention a problem that you should know of (as legislation      is now pending to cure the problem, H.R. 1997), but perhaps      the effect of the present status of the law escaped you.       As you know, for some thirty years civil rights legislation      has been in force in this country; that includes Title VII,      the ADA, the ADEA, and other types of such statutes. As a      part of the legislative effort to provide remedies to victims      of discrimination, Congress also passed an attorney fees      provision that entitles a successful plaintiff to have his or      her attorney fees and expenses compensated by the losing      defendant, subject to the trial court's discretion.      Certainly, this legislation had a salutary effect in ending      some of the worst vestiges of discrimination and seeing that      the litigators were paid for their efforts as ``private      attorneys general''. The United States Supreme Court has      endorsed this concept in numerous cases.       What I now bring to your attention is the fact that all of      this legislation has been rendered meaningless and, indeed,      punitive against plaintiffs and their attorneys, by the      Congress's passage in 1996 of the Small Business Protection      Act and the various tax laws enacted by Congress over the      years. I have a real life example to bring to your attention,      in the hope that you will see how unfair and offensive is the      present state of the law. In fact, in light of the law as it      is today, it is entirely possible that no attorney in his or      her right mind would take any plaintiff's civil rights      case, and that no person in his or her right mind would      undertake to litigate civil rights discrimination no      matter how much they were harmed by such actions.       First, it is my understanding that the tax laws now require      the payment of taxes upon any and all sums obtained in      litigation or settlement that are not clearly related to      ``personal physical injury''. As most (if not all) civil      rights and discrimination cases brought under Title VII, the      ADA, etc., rarely involve ``personal physical injury'', most      (if not all) jury verdicts, judge awards and/or settlements      are entirely taxable to the victim of discrimination. Perhaps      that was truly the intent of Congress in its 1996 passage of      the amendment to Internal Revenue Code Section 104. If so,      then victims of discrimination certainly do owe taxes on      whatever they might receive by way of verdict, judgment or      settlement, and should pay those taxes. Of course, that      frequently prevents settlements from occurring or raises the      cost of the settlements, but that might also be within      Congress's intent in passing the legislation. (That less than      salutary effect of the 1996 amendment is one reason quite a      variety of groups have supported the proposed bill, H.R.      1997, among them the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, NELA, the      AARP, etc.) In any event, that is not the entire problem      facing victims and litigators.       The most pernicious problem and one which causes me to      write to you is the combined effect of the above legislation      coupled with other laws of Congress, court cases and IRS      regulations. The effect is to cause any and all lawyers who      might wish to advocate for plaintiffs who have been harmed by      discrimination to rethink whether, in fact, they wish to      continue to do that work. And it places lawyers who do      continue to advocate at loggerheads with their clients'      interests.       The law is now clear that victims of discrimination owe tax      payments on whatever settlement/judgment they might receive.      And it is clear that their attorneys owe tax payments on      whatever attorney fees and expenses they are awarded.      However, the law is also quite clear that the victims of      discrimination also owe taxes upon the amount of     money their attorney is compensated for his/her efforts in      obtaining the settlement/verdict. While in some situations it      is possible to deduct those costs, given the Alternative      Minimum Tax provisions and recent Tax Court cases, it is      close to impossible to do so. Thus, victims of discrimination      may well add up with an additional tax burden in excess of      any sums of money actually obtained in the litigation to      compensate them for their injuries. This must be contrary to      the intent of Congress in passing civil rights legislation      over the past thirty years, and the views of the Supreme      Court in holding that attorney fees awards should be fully      but reasonably compensatory to the attorneys, in order to      facilitate attorneys in handling civil rights legislation.       I can provide you with a real-life example which impacts an      Iowa citizen who successfully fought discrimination and      retaliation and his attorney, the undersigned, who joined in      that effort. Based on what we know now, both of us are      quite sorry we ever entered into the effort to prevent      discrimination and retaliation from occurring.       Don Lyons assisted a co-worker in filing a sex      discrimination complaint against their employer. As a result,      he and the co-worker were retaliated against. We brought suit      on behalf of the co-worker for sex discrimination in      employment in the Southern District of Iowa and made a claim      for retaliation in violation of Title VII on behalf of both      Don and his co-worker. The case was litigated in the court      here, with the result that the sex discrimination case was      resolved prior to trial. However, because no settlement of      Don's claim was possible, his retaliation case went onto a      jury trial before eight jurors from the southern District of      Iowa.       We put on two days of evidence before the jury and Judge      Wolle, with the result that Don was awarded $1.00 in nominal      damages (a recognition of his right to bring the claim) and      $150,000 in punitive damages. On post-trial motions, Judge      Wolle upheld the jury's verdict on liability and held that      there was sufficient evidence that ``defendant had an evil      motive and had intentionally violated federal law in      retaliating against Lyons because he had assisted other      pilots in protecting their civil rights.'' However, Judge      Wolle remitted the punitive damage amount to $15,000.00,      because he thought that would be sufficient to punish the      defendant. Pursuant to the attorney fee provision of the      civil rights law, I have petitioned the court for      approximately $170,000 in fees and expenses; that is based on      my hourly rate of $180.00 an hour (a rate much less than that      of lawyers in other cities, and probably much less than the      two defense lawyers from Chicago who tried the case). The      fees and expenses amount may seem high, but is the result of      a fair amount of contentiousness and the need to take      depositions in Kansas and Arizona.       The problem for my client and for myself arises from the      clear tax implications of this situation. My client would      normally pay out of his $15,000 in punitive damages the sum      of $5,467.00, and that would be fine for him.       However, if the court awards me a ``fully compensatory''      fee and expenses figure of $150,000 (I am using that as an      example, because we have run the figures on this sum), not      only will I pay my taxes on this figure (gladly so), but my      client will also and without the ability to deduct the sum      due to the pernicious effect of the alternative minimum tax!                                                                 AmountDon's taxes of $15,000........................................$5,467.00Don's taxes on $15,000 plus the attorney fee award of $150,00067,791.00Difference/Additional Taxes Owed by Don for the ``privilege'' of   having won his retaliation case.............................58,236.00                                                             __________                                                                    In other words, because Don assisted someone to bring a      claim of sex discrimination through appropriate channels and      prevailed in his jury trial claim of retaliation, he will be      forced by present tax laws to pay an additional amount of      $58,236.00, which is over two-thirds of his annual salary.      And he will not have any additional money as a result of the      remittment of the judgment to pay that additional tax. And      because Don hired me to be his advocate and then prevailed      before a jury of eight citizens, he is penalized with a      severe tax penalty for having advocated civil rights. And I      need not tell you that this result has severely strained what      had been a cordial and positive working relationship between      attorney and client.       This is a clear injustice and one that we cannot find any      way of resolving, given the present state of the law. If we      could, we would. We are, therefore, bringing this to your      attention because it is a concern which only legislation can      rectify. We believe that H.R. 1997 is the only means possible      to rectify this problem and urge you to support it strongly      and vocally as soon as Congress returns.       If you have need of further information, please let me      know. Both Don and I would appreciate the opportunity to      visit with you or your staff to discuss this problem and to      shed light upon how this situation causes me to rethink my      chosen profession and Don to rethink his willingness to      assist people who are being discriminated against.           Very truly yours,                                              Victoria L. Herring,                                                  Attorney at Law.
