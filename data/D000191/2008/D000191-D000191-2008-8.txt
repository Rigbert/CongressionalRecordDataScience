Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 1224) commending the Tennessee Valley Authority on its 75th anniversary.  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.  The text of the resolution is as follows:                              H. Res. 1224       Whereas May 18, 2008, marks the 75th anniversary of the      Tennessee Valley Authority;       Whereas the Tennessee Valley Authority was created by      Congress in 1933 to improve navigation along the Tennessee      River, reduce the risk of flood damage, provide electric      power, and promote agricultural and industrial development in      the region;       Whereas the Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933 (16      U.S.C. 831 et seq.) was signed into law by President Franklin      D. Roosevelt on May 18, 1933;       Whereas the Tennessee Valley Authority continues to serve      the Tennessee Valley, providing reliable and affordable      electricity, managing the Tennessee River system, and      stimulating economic growth;       Whereas the Tennessee Valley Authority provides more      electricity than any other public utility in the Nation and      has competitive rates and reliable transmission;       Whereas the Tennessee Valley Authority is expanding its      environmental policy to increase its renewable energy      sources, improve energy efficiency, and provide clean energy      in the Tennessee Valley region;       Whereas the Tennessee Valley Authority continues to reduce      power plant emissions and is working to further improve air      quality for the health of individuals in the Tennessee Valley      region;       Whereas the Tennessee Valley Authority is a leader in the      nuclear power industry, with multi-site nuclear power      operations that provide approximately 30 percent of the      Tennessee Valley Authority's power supply;       Whereas as part of NuStart Energy Consortium, the Tennessee      Valley Authority submitted one of the first combined      operating license applications for a new nuclear power plant      in 30 years;       Whereas the Tennessee Valley Authority's integrated      management of the Tennessee River system provides a wide      range of benefits that include providing electrical power,      reducing floods, facilitating freight transportation,      improving water quality and supply, enhancing recreation, and      protecting public land;       Whereas the Tennessee Valley Authority builds business and      community partnerships that foster economic prosperity,      helping companies and communities attract investments that      bring jobs to the Tennessee Valley region and keep them      there; and       Whereas the Tennessee Valley Authority no longer receives      appropriation to help fund its activities in navigation,      flood control, environmental research, and land management,      because the Tennessee Valley Authority pays for all its      activities through power sales and issuing bonds: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--       (1) commends the Tennessee Valley Authority on its 75th      anniversary;       (2) recognizes the Tennessee Valley Authority for its long      and proud history of service in the areas of energy, the      environment, and economic development in a service area that      includes 7 States;       (3) honors the Board of Directors, retirees, staff, and      supporters of the Tennessee Valley Authority who were      instrumental during the Tennessee Valley Authority's first 75      years; and       (4) directs the Clerk of the House of Representatives to      transmit a copy of this resolution to the Chairman of the      Board of the Tennessee Valley Authority, Bill Sansom, and the      Chief Executive Officer of the Tennessee Valley Authority,      Tom Kilgore, for appropriate display.
