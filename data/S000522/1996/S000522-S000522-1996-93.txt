Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. Just let me say that, as my colleague knows, he must find some things in this bill that he agrees with. I mean we worked together on the refugee provisions. There are a lot of things in this bill: the boat people, protections that are in the bill.  But let me just say, so the record is very, very clear about this, during markup of this legislation we had five hearings that preceded the markup in my subcommittee because major provisions of this bill went through my subcommittee because we are the committee of jurisdiction on the State Department. I was much aghast and chagrined by the fact that my ranking member walked out. Rather than participate in the markup, he walked out.  So we talk about bipartisanship. We sought at every turn to include rather than to exclude.
