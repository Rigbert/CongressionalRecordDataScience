President, yesterday, an amendment offered by Senator Feinstein to the anti-``slamming'' bill, S. 1618, was passed without debate. While this amendment was intended to enhance the privacy rights of patients, the consequence of this amendment would be far different. Specifically, this amendment would change current federal law and put patients at risk of criminal liability if they record their conversations with health providers and health insurers without first alerting and obtaining the consent of those providers and insurers.  This Feinstein amendment modifies the wiretap law, in title 18 of the United States Code, but was never considered by the Committee of the Judiciary, which has jurisdiction over this law. The risk of passing legislation quickly and bypassing the Committee with jurisdiction over the subject matter is amply revealed by the unintended consequence of this amendment.  If this amendment becomes law, the minority rule adopted by only a small number of States--sixteen--requiring the consent of all parties for the lawful interception of telephone calls, would be applied to all conversations that take place between patients and health insurers or providers. There are a number of legitimate reasons for patients to want to record their calls with a health provider or insurer: medical instructions can be complicated. Insurers' explanations of coverage or decisions regarding reimbursement may be complicated. Patients may have sound reasons for recording those conversations if they are unable to take notes or want to keep the oral instructions for future reference. For example, patients, especially Alzheimer sufferers, may want to record their calls as a memory aid, and be too embarrassed to say so.  A more carefully crafted amendment would have reduced the unwarranted risk of criminal liability to patients. If this provision were to become law, we would have to revisit this issue promptly.                          ____________________
