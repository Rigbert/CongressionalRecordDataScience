''  The American Association for Cancer Research, I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              American Association                                    for Cancer Research, Inc.,                               Philadelphia, PA, February 4, 1998.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: Medical research, conducted in the      United States over the last 20 years, has opened up      tremendous opportunities to make progress against many      devastating diseases. The scientific community does not      desire to make human beings, or modify or genetically mark      any portion of our population. However, to deny the      application of molecular biology, made possible through the      use of cloning technologies, to patients who could be      benefitted would be a great injustice.       A litany of beneficial applications of cloning technology      was enumerated in this weeks TIME Magazine. Several of these      applications are at the core of cutting-edge cancer research,      and there are many more potential benefits that are unknown      at this time. These applications, as well as any future      progress, would be eliminated by broad legislation setting      back progress and potential in our conquest to develop      effective approaches to the prevention, detection, and      treatment of cancer.       The American Association for Cancer Research (AACR), with      over 14,000 members, is the largest professional organization      of basic and clinical cancer researchers in the world.      Founded in 1907, its mission is to prevent, treat, and cure      cancer through research, scientific programs, and education.      To accomplish these important goals it is essential that      scientists vigorously pursue all promising lines of      investigations against cancer.       The AACR feels strongly that an ethical and just compromise      can be reached that will protect the public and the      scientific community from the irresponsible application of      cloning technology while permitting meaningful and ethical      research to move forward. The medical and cancer research      community feels that the present rush to enact legislation      without proper consideration or deliberation is a serious      mistake, and the unfortunate result would be irresponsible      legislation.       As scientists we clearly see the tremendous advantages of      cloning technology as well as its potential problems, which      we, also, have reason to fear if it is applied in an      unreasonable manner.       The AACR, therefore, appeals to all Members of Congress to      establish and honor a moratorium of at least 45 days on      enacting any legislation until definitions and implications      of legislation can be determined in a more reasonable and      thoughtful manner, and in an open and public process. This      would be a service to humanity, science, and millions of      individuals who are now suffering, or will suffer in the      future, from catastrophic and crippling diseases such as      cancer. We appeal to all members of Congress to give this      important moral and scientific issue very careful      consideration and deliberation. Clearly a rush to judgment on      this complex issue could be a major setback for cancer and      medical research.           Sincerely,                                          Donald S. Coffey, Ph.D.,                                                        President.
