 The Senator is correct, there are other regions in the country that are in great need of additional cemetery space. My goal is to ensure that this land is preserved so that when the need for additional cemetery space arises, 20-50 years from now, the Federal Government will have land without major construction or contamination issues which can be easily converted into a cemetery.  Veterans Affairs Secretary Jesse Brown has suggested both to local leaders and the House that a veterans memorial park would be a good interim step to protect the land. This action would not be an additional burden on the taxpayer because local leaders strongly feel they can raise the needed funds privately to create this park. I hope that the committee will support this effort with the inclusion of language in the conference report.
