President, this is an opportunity to recognize the service of several of our colleagues who are departing from the Senate. To Senator Jeffords, Senator Frist, Senator DeWine, Senator Talent, SenatorSantorum, Senator Burns, and Senator Allen, let me express my appreciation for their service to their States and their service to the Nation and wish them well. I particularly want to comment, though, on three colleagues with whom I have had the privilege of working very closely.                             Paul Sarbanes
