 President, I pay tribute to Pierre Pelham, a former colleague of mine in the Alabama State Senate, who recently passed away. He was a personal friend and, along with his family, I mourn his passing.  A native of Chatom, AL, and a resident of Mobile, AL, Pierre was born on July 20, 1929, to Judge and Mrs. Joe M. Pelham, Jr. An incredibly bright student, he graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Alabama and received his J.D. cum laude from Harvard Law School. During the Korean war, Pierre served as a captain in the Army and received both the Combat Infantryman Badge and Expert Infantryman Badge.  After his service in the Army, Pierre returned to Alabama and began to practice law. Described by many as brilliant, Pierre often took on cases that other lawyers did not want. One of his more interesting cases involved representing Aristotle Onassis' wife in her divorce from the wealthy shipping magnate.  In the 1960s, Pierre began to pursue his interest in politics. He served as the national campaign coordinator for Governor George Wallace and later as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention from Alabama's 1st Congressional District in 1960 and 1964. In 1966, Pierre was elected to serve in the Alabama State Senate. It was there that I had the distinct pleasure of working with him.  In 1970, Pierre was elected to serve as president pro tempore of the Senate. Pierre was renowned by our colleagues as an excellent orator and an exceptionally persuasive State senator. When word would spread around the State capitol that Pierre was speaking on the senate floor, it was not uncommon for the gallery to fill with spectators and for members of the House to cross over to the Senate to watch what would surely be an extraordinary speech. His articulation and command of the English language were simply captivating.  Although Pierre eventually retired from public life, as a fellow of Harvard's Kennedy Institute of Politics, he remained interested in national, State, and local affairs his entire life. Most people in Mobile will remember Pierre for his many contributions as a State senator to South Alabama, most notably his support for the creation of the University of South Alabama College of Medicine. I knew him to be honest, hardworking, and a committed State senator. He remained dedicated to his family and the people of Alabama throughout his life.  Pierre is loved and respected and will be missed by his wife Eva Pelham; his sons Marc Pelham and Joseph Pelham, IV; his daughters Pierrette Prestridge and Patrice Pelham; and 12 grandchildren. I ask the entire Senate to join me in recognizing and honoring the life of my friend, Pierre Pelham.                          ____________________
