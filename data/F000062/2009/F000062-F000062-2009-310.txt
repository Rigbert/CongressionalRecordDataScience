 President, I rise today with Senator Bond to introduce the Tariff Relief Assistance for Developing Economies Act of 2009 to help some of the world's poorest countries sustain vital export industries and promote economic growth and political stability.  I worked with former senator Gordon Smith on this bill in the past and I am proud to move it forward in the 111th Congress.  This legislation will provide duty free and quota free benefits for garments and other products similar to those afforded to beneficiary countries under the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, AGOA.  The countries covered by this legislation are the 14 Least Developed Countries, LDCs, as defined by the United Nations and the U.S. State Department, which are not covered by any current U.S. trade preference program: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Kiribati, Laos, Maldives, Nepal, Samoa, Solomon Islands, East Timor, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and Yemen.  The bill also includes Sri Lanka as an eligible country.  To be eligible for the benefits provided under our bill, a country must demonstrate that it is making continual progress toward establishing rule of law, political pluralism, the right to due process, and a market-based economy that protects private property rights. Our legislation would help promote democracy while sustaining vital export industries and creating employment opportunities.  The beneficiary countries of this legislation are among the poorest countries in the world.  Nepal has per capita income of $240. Unemployment in Bangladesh stands at 40 percent. Approximately 36 percent of Cambodia's population lives below the poverty line.  Each country faces critical challenges in the years ahead including poor health care, insufficient educational opportunities, high HIV/AIDS rates, and the effects of war and civil strife.  The U.S. must take a leadership role in providing much needed assistance to the people of these countries.  Yet humanitarian and development assistance should not be the sum total of our efforts to put these countries on the road to economic prosperity and political stability.  Indeed, the key for sustained growth and rising standards of living will be the ability of each of these countries to create vital export industries to compete in a free and open global marketplace.  We should help these countries help themselves by opening the U.S. market to their exports.  Success in that endeavor will ultimately allow these countries to become less dependent on foreign aid and allow the U.S. to provide assistance to countries in greater need.  The garment industry is a key part of the manufacturing sector in some of these countries.  In Nepal, the garment industry is entirely export oriented and accounts for 40 percent of foreign exchange earnings. It employs over 100,000 workers--half of them women--and sustains the livelihood of over 350,000 people.  The United States is the largest market for Nepalese garments and accounts for 80-90 percent of Nepal's total exports every year.  In Cambodia, approximately 250,000 Cambodians work in the garment industry supporting approximately one million dependents. The garment industry accounts for more than 90 percent of Cambodia's export earnings.  In Bangladesh, the garment industry accounts for 75 percent of export earnings. The industry employs 1.8 million people, 90 percent of whom are women, and sustains the livelihoods of 10 to 15 million people.  Despite the poverty seen in these countries and the importance of the garment industry and the U.S. market, they face some of the highest U.S. tariffs in the world, averaging over 15 percent. In contrast, countries like Japan and our European partners face tariffs that are nearly zero.  Surely we can do better. This legislation will help these countries compete in the U.S. market and let their citizens know that Americans are committed to helping them realize a better future for themselves and their families.  Doing so is consistent with U.S. goals to combat poverty, instability, and terrorism in a critical part of the world. We should not forget that of the approximately 265 million people that live in the TRADE Act countries, almost 200 million are Muslim.  The impact on U.S. jobs will be minimal. Currently, the beneficiary countries under this legislation account for only 4 percent of U.S. textile and apparel imports, compared to 24 percent for China, and 72 percent for the rest of the world.  These countries will continue to be small players in the U.S. market, but the benefits of this legislation will have a major impact on their export economies.  At a time when we are trying to rebuild the image of the U.S. around the world, we need legislation such as this to show the best of America and American values. It will provide a vital component to our development strategy and add another tool to the war on terror. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1141       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Tariff Relief Assistance for      Developing Economies Act of 2009'' or the ``TRADE Act of      2009''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) It is in the mutual interest of the United States and      least-developed countries to promote stable and sustainable      economic growth and development.       (2) Trade and investment are powerful economic tools and      can be used to reduce poverty and raise the standard of      living in a country.       (3) A country that is open to trade may increase its      economic growth.       (4) Trade and investment often lead to employment      opportunities and often help alleviate poverty.       (5) Least-developed countries have a particular challenge      in meeting the economic requirements and competitiveness of      globalization and international markets.       (6) The United States has recognized the benefits that      international trade provides to least-developed countries by      enacting the Generalized System of Preferences and trade      benefits for developing countries in the Caribbean, Andean,      and sub-Saharan African regions of the world.       (7) Enhanced trade with least-developed Muslim countries,      including Yemen, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh, is consistent      with other United States objectives of encouraging a strong      private sector and individual economic empowerment in those      countries.       (8) Offering least-developed countries enhanced trade      preferences will encourage both higher levels of trade and      direct investment in support of positive economic and      political developments throughout the world.       (9) Encouraging the reciprocal reduction of trade and      investment barriers will enhance the benefits of trade and      investment as well as enhance commercial and political ties      between the United States and the countries designated for      benefits under this Act.       (10) Economic opportunity and engagement in the global      trading system together with support for democratic      institutions and a respect for human rights are mutually      reinforcing objectives and key elements of a policy to      confront and defeat global terrorism.
