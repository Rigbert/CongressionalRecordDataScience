 I understand the distinguished majority leader has been assured by his constituents of the importance of Amtrak to the State of Mississippi. If Amtrak were an airline, it would be the largest air carrier in the country. Amtrak is the single largest individual passenger carrier on the east coast, and to replace Amtrak's service in the East, as well as around the country, would require more lanes of interstate highway and more air pollution, more airport construction, additional safety concerns and increased congestion for all parts of the Nation. So let us not kid ourselves that Amtrak is not important to all parts of our country. But I agree, it is of particular importance to my State and the east coast.  I thank the chairman and ranking member, and I yield back the 12 second I may have left.
