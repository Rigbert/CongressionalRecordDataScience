 May I also ask him, and I see the chairman of the Committee on Rules on the floor, you correctly observed, Mr. Leader, this is a complicated bill, a lot of different subjects, very important subjects, very consequential subjects. What, if you know, perhaps the chairman of the Committee on Rules knows, do you contemplate an open rule such as the rule we had on the floor today?  Mr. DeLAY. The discussion in the Committee on Rules has not been forthcoming, and certainly we would hope that a rule would be fashioned to give every Member of the House the greatest opportunity to express himself on a very important and complicated piece of legislation like the energy bill.
