President, I have already spoken about this, and I want to reiterate what I said earlier. Our country, justifiably so, is a beacon of hope for so many who face human rights abuses. I think of what is written on the iconic Statue of Liberty; so many people come to our shores for freedom. We also know there are many who are being held in these despicable trafficking schemes around the world. There are children who are 11, 12, 13 years old being held, and we have to speak for them.  I hope all Senators will join me in voting for this amendment. There are protections for victims of trafficking in the reauthorization act. It is a bipartisan bill written with the input of victims and service providers. It helps us to more effectively fight human trafficking, which is really modern-day slavery. Whether people are trafficked in the sex trade--especially children--or in forced labor, it is slavery. It is not isolated. There are 27 million victims worldwide today according to the Polaris Project. This amendment will help us to stop it by supporting both domestic and international efforts to fight against trafficking.  Just as important as it is to help us punish the perpetrators, the amendment will help us rebuild the lives of those caught up in it. We know funds are always limited. We put in accountability measures to ensure the Federal funds are used for their intended purposes.  Let us continue to have the United States as a beacon of hope to people around the world.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters in support of amendment 21, the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, to S. 47, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                              Americans for Immigrant Justice,                                Washington, DC, February 11, 2013.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate          Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy: Americans for Immigrant Justice (AI      Justice), is writing to express our strong support for final      passage of the Violence Against Women Act (S. 47) and      amendment #21 to S. 47. This vital legislation and amendment      improves existing VAWA programs and strengthens protections      for all victims of violence.       AI Justice was established in 1996 and provides free legal      services to immigrants of all nationalities, including      immigrant victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and      human trafficking. AI Justice's specialized Lucha Project      addresses survivors' needs in a holistic manner and engages      all immigrant communities in an effort to end violence      against women. We have assisted thousands of immigrant      survivors, and we understand firsthand why this important      legislation and amendment are needed.       The authorization in the Trafficking Victims Protection Act      (TVPA) expired on September 30, 2011. We ask all Senators to      support amendment #21, which reauthorizes the TVPA and      provides additional tools necessary to combat trafficking and      modern-day slavery at home and abroad. We urge all Senators      to oppose any attempt to weaken the bill and oppose any      attempts to attach non-germane amendments to S. 47.       The United States can and should do more to help protect      all victims and fight domestic violence and human      trafficking. We urge all Senators to vote for final passage      of the Violence Against Women Act and for amendment #21,      which reauthorizes the Trafficking Victims Protection Act.           Sincerely,                                                Cory W. Smith,                                   Washington, DC Office Director,     Americans for Immigrant Justice.                                  ____                                           Alliance To End Slavery                                              and Trafficking,                                Washington, DC, February 11, 2013.     Sen. Patrick Leahy,     Russell Senate Bldg, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy, The Alliance to End Slavery and      Trafficking (ATEST), a diverse alliance of U.S.-based human      rights organizations, acting with a shared agenda to end      modern-day slavery and human trafficking around the world, is      writing to express our strong support for amendment (#21) to      the Violence Against Women Act (S. 47). This critical      amendment includes the text of S. 1301, the Trafficking      Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA), and      additional grant reporting requirements.       As of September 30, 2011, the authorizations contained in      the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) expired. We      urge Senators to support amendment #21, which reauthorizes      the TVPA, provides additional tools necessary to combat      trafficking and modern-day slavery at home and abroad, and      continues the fight to end modern-day slavery and human      trafficking in our generation.       Although the United States has taken significant steps to      combat human trafficking through a comprehensive approach,      much more needs to be done. The scope of human trafficking      and slavery has come into sharp focus over the past years      with an estimated 27 million slaves worldwide. Combined,      human trafficking and slavery are the world's third largest      criminal enterprises, after drugs and weapons. The United      States can and should do more to help fight human trafficking      both domestically and internationally. We urge passage of the      amendment to continue U.S. leadership and further the victim-     centered approach that has been crucial to combating human      trafficking around the world.           Sincerely,         Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking (CAST),            Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW), ECPAT-USA, Free            the Slaves, International Justice Mission, Not for Sale            Campaign, Polaris Project, Safe Horizon, Solidarity            Center, Verite, Vital Voices Global Partnership, World            Vision.                                  ____                                          Freedom Network USA,                                                February 11, 2013.     Re Amendment #21 (Trafficking Victims Protection          Reauthorization Act) to S. 47 (Violence Against Women          Act)     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Russell          Senate Bldg., U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman, The Freedom Network (USA), which was      established in 2001, is a coalition of 35 nongovernmental      organizations and individual experts that provide services      to, and advocate for the rights of, trafficking survivors in      the United States. The Trafficking Victims Protection      Reauthorization Act (TVPRA), groundbreaking legislation which      increased the U.S. government's efforts to protect victims,      authorized the government to strengthen efforts to prosecute      traffickers, and allowed for increased prevention measures,      funds some of the Freedom Network's most vital programs,      including comprehensive case management, shelter, and legal      services. The Freedom Network enthusiastically commends and      supports you for introducing this vital legislation as an      amendment (Amendment #21) to the bill to reauthorize the      Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) (Senate Bill 47).       With an estimated 27 million victims of human trafficking      worldwide, the United States should continue to lead the      charge to end this human rights abuse. Throughout the course      of the 112th Congress, the Freedom Network worked fervently      in support of the TVPRA (S. 1301), which ultimately      culminated in 57 co-sponsors from both sides of the aisle by      the end of 2012. Today, the Senate will resume consideration      of S. 47, and they will debate Amendment #21 to authorize      appropriations for fiscal years 2014 through 2017 for the      TVPRA, to enhance     measures to combat trafficking in persons, and for other      purposes. Both the TVPRA and VAWA are critical to survivors      of human trafficking, domestic violence, and sexual assault.       Thank you for your continued attention to this issue.      Please contact Freedom Network Policy Co-Chairs Keeli      Sorensen ([email protected]) and Ivy Suriyopas      ([email protected]) if you have any questions.           Sincerely yours,     Bill Bernstein,       Co-Chair.     Patricia Medige,       Co-Chair.     Suzanne Tomatore,       Co-Chair.
