Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of Frank J. Piasecki, of Toledo, Ohio. Mr. Piasecki passed from this life at the age of 91 years on March 5, 2018. He was a lifelong neighbor and constructive force across our community.  Born to parents Casper and Emily, Frank graduated from Woodward High School. Following his graduation he was a proud member of the United States Marine Corps and served as a gunner during World War II. After the war, on September 14, 1946, Frank and his wife Donna were married and together raised four children. Frank and Donna shared their lives together for a remarkable 71 years.  Frank Piasecki loved to repair cars, and he opened Piasecki's Service Inc, which has become a fixture in the Reynolds Corners neighborhood. A compassionate businessman dedicated to his community, Frank also served on the Reynolds Corners Adams Township Fire Department for many years. The business remains an anchor in the neighborhood, even as the next generation continues to grow it. The family's honesty and integrity are well-known.  Even while operating a business and raising a family, Frank Piasecki was a motorcycle enthusiast and enjoyed shooting, leading to his lifelong membership in the NRA and the American Motorcycle Association. In fact, during his racing days he was the 1952 winner of the Jack Pine Enduro. Frank also was involved in the Adams Conservation Club, where he coached the Junior Program. A proud veteran, Frank was long a member of American Legion Post 553. An avid bowler, Frank finally bowled a perfect game at the age of 71.  Frank Piasecki leaves a legacy through his honorable service to our nation in the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II, his respected records in the highly competitive world of racing, his lifetime of community minded business practices in building forward the Reynolds Corners community, and his exemplary life as a husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather. Truly, his lasting legacy is that of his family. He leaves to cherish his memory his wife and children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and many friends. We offer our sincere condolences, and hope they find comfort in the gift of Frank's life.                          ____________________
