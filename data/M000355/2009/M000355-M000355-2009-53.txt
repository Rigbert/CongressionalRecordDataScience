 In addition to the public opinion polls we have all seen, we are each having experiences with individuals. I will cite three.  I ran into a police officer--a long-term police officer, an African American. He came up to me and said: Senator, you have to stop this health care bill.  Then there are the health care providers. I see Dr. Barrasso from Wyoming. Within the last week, I spoke to one of the Nation's fine cardiovascular surgeons. He said: Please stop the health care bill. This is going to destroy the quality of our profession. He told me of a friend of his, a neurosurgeon, who called him with the same concern.  I get the sense that there are an enormous number of health care providers--physicians, hospitals, everybody involved in the health care provider business--apparently, with the exception of the pharmaceutical industry, which seems to have cut a special deal--who are just apoplectic about the possibility that the finest health care in the world is going to be destroyed by this--as the Senator from Tennessee points out--``historic mistake.''  Mr. McCAIN. I will mention, also, on the issue of PhRMA, again, here we are in the direst of economic times, with a Consumer Price Index that has declined by 1.3 percent this year, and they have orchestrated a 9-percent increase in the cost of prescription drugs--that is remarkable--laying on an additional burden, which naturally falls more on seniors than anybody else since they are the greatest users of pharmaceutical drugs. I don't blame them for fighting for their industry. But the point is, what they are doing is harming millions and millions of Americans.  Again, about contributing to the cynicism of the American people, whether you are for or against the issue of drug reimportation, to cut a deal behind closed doors and then, apparently, because of support of an amendment by Senator Dorgan, go down and negotiate another deal--how do you describe a process like that?
