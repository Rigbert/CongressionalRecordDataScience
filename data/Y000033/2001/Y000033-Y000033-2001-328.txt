Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden) for his comments. On page 18 of the committee report, thegentleman is aware of the language that we put in the report that he had requested; but we are more than willing to cooperate the best we can within whatever budgetary constraint that exists at the time to deal with the gentleman's issues and would like to assure him of that and thank him very much for having discussed this with us well in advance and he gave us an opportunity to actually provide the language that he requested in the report.
