Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Maryland, Steny Hoyer, for the support. It is going to take a lot of effort. There is a lot of naysayers out there. But, again, I believe so strongly that we treat every American equally.  This is a civil rights issue, and they have voted 97 percent in favor of statehood. As you know, I led this battle with your help in 1997. We had a vote, and, with your side, I won by one vote. Puerto Rico and Alaska didn't go anywhere, but I ask every American to think about it.  Let's make this the last colony. Let's make this the 51st State.                          ____________________
