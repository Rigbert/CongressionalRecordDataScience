President, it is time for a bipartisan summit on the budget.  As I said back in June during the debate on the 1996 budget resolution, I fear that the Republican congressional leadership and the President are on a collision course over the budget.  An immediate bipartisan budget summit is needed to forge a solution to next year's appropriations bills, or we will have a disaster on our hands that will force the entire Government to an abrupt halt this fall.  The start of the 1996 fiscal year is less than a month away, yet we are far from completing the 13 annual appropriations bills needed to fund the Government. In fact, we are very close to a fiscal disaster.  The House, Senate, and the President are still miles apart on these bills without much effort being made to find common ground within the next 30 days. And the administration is now preparing contingency plans for agencies to continue essential operations in case we fail to agree before the first of October.  I see little hope for an agreement if we keep to our current course.  Of the 11 appropriations bills passed so far in the House, President Clinton has threatened to veto 6. The Senate has passed seven appropriations bills, with huge differences from their House counterparts. Indeed, the Senate and House have reached agreement on only one appropriations bill.  The political rhetoric is heating up as the fiscal disagreement continues.  Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich has declared that: ``The budget fight for me is the equivalent of Gettysburg in the Civil War.''  President Clinton has also refused to back down, saying: ``I will not be blackmailed into selling the American people's future down the drain to avoid a train wreck. Better a train wreck.''  This push for a train wreck is stupid on both sides. We don't need to shut down the Government to prove we are Democrats or Republicans. We all know that an all Republican budget will not become law or an all Democratic budget will not become law.  This political posturing is just what Vermonters tell me that they dislike about Washington.  Shutting down the Government in an attempt to score political points will only bring more scorn of our political system. It is time to put our political differences aside and come together in a bipartisan budget summit--before the crisis.  Our political system will not be the only loser if political gamesmanship causes a Government shutdown--a shutdown will also be a loser for U.S. taxpayers. Government shutdowns waste taxpayer money.  In 1981, for example, the Government spent $5.5 million to close offices and send workers home. In 1990, a President and Congress of different parties failed to reach a bipartisan agreement on the budget. And the General Accounting Office calculated that the resulting 3-day Government shutdown cost taxpayers between $244 and $607 million.  Government shutdowns also hurt the citizens in our society who depend on our Government the most. In 1979, an 11-day Government shutdown led to delays in Federal payments for housing subsidies, delays in GI bill education checks, and delays in aid to the disabled.  A longer shutdown could hurt senior citizens who rely on their Social Security income, students who rely on Federal loans, farmers who rely on Federal support programs, travelers who rely on our air traffic control system, and consumers who rely on meat inspections.  We need a bipartisan budget summit to avoid such a costly Government shutdown. For a summit to succeed, everything must be on the table: taxes, health care reform, entitlement reform, further spending reductions, and the time it will take to get to a balanced budget.  Such a summit will be a grueling, sometimes acrimonious, encounter. But anyone who has studied the various blueprints can see the outlines of an agreement.  Both Republicans and Democrats agree that we must consolidate unnecessary Government programs, reform welfare, and control Medicare and Medicaid spending. We may now disagree on some of the details for accomplishing these goals, but that is why we need a bipartisan summit--to hammer out the details of a compromise.                          ____________________
