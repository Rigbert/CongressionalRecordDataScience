Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume in order to place in the Record language from the New York Times this morning refuting what my very dear colleague, the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Emerson), has indicated.  It says Dr. Jane Henney, the Commissioner of Food and Drug, said, ``Nothing in the bill requires a manufacturer to give the approved label to an importer or to allow use of the label by an importer, which means that it is not enforceable.''  And then today we receive from the Office of the President, the Office of Management and Budget, the following. And I enter the direct language in the Record because in the future we will have to repair the damage that is going to be done when this bill is passed today. It says, ``The administration is disappointed that the prescription drug reimportation provision in this bill will fail to achieve its goal of providing needed relief from the high costs of prescription drugs. The majority leadership chose to end bipartisan negotiations and, instead, produced a provision in the conference report that leaves numerous loopholes that will render this provision meaningless. Specifically, it allows drug manufacturers to deny importers access to FDA-approved labeling required for reimportation so that any and all drug companies could, and probably would, block reimportation of their medications. Second, a sunset was added that ends the importation system 5 years after it goes into effect. This will limit private and public sector interest in investing in this system.''  And I would just depart from that to say to my colleague that sunset was not in the Jeffords bill, as the gentlewoman indicated earlier today.  And, finally, third, this letter says, ``The conference language permits the drug industry to use contracts or agreements to provide financial disincentives for foreign distributors to reimport to U.S. importers. It is wrong that U.S. citizens pay the highest prices in the world for medications, leaving many with no option than to go abroad to obtain affordable prescription drugs. But it is also wrong to provide false hope that this provision will work to address the problem. Moreover, Congress has thus far failed to pass a meaningful Medicare prescription drug benefit that will not only provide price discounts but will ensure seniors and people with disabilities against the catastrophic costs of medications.''  That is a direct quote from the Executive Office of the President. And, Mr. Speaker, the full content of the statement is as follows:                   Statement of Administration Policy    (This statement has been coordinated by OMB with the concerned                                agencies.)       h.r. 4461--agriculture, rural development, food and drug     administration, and related agencies appropriations bill fy 2001       (Sponsors: Skeen (R), New Mexico; Cochran (R) Mississippi)       This Statement of Administration Policy provides the      Administration's views on the conference version of the      Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration,      and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, FY 2001.       The conference report includes support for a number of      important priorities for the Nation. In particular, the bill      includes full funding for the President's Food Safety      Initiative, significant increases in rural development      programs to help rural communities and residents take part in      the national economic expansion, provisions that will enable      food stamp recipients to own dependable cars and have better      shelter without losing their eligibility, and relief to      farmers and ranchers who suffered losses from natural      disasters. While the Administration continues to support a      range of conservation efforts, such as the Farmland      Protection Wetlands Reserve, and Environmental Quality      Incentives Programs, and is disappointed that this bill did      not provide full funding for these efforts, we do appreciate      the increases that were provided including funds for      conservation technical assistance. However, while the      Administration supports this conference report, it has      concerns with several provisions in the bill.       The Administration is disappointed that the prescription      drug reimportation provision in this bill will fail to      achieve its goal of providing needed relief from the high      costs of prescription drugs. The majority leadership chose to      end bipartisan negotiations and instead produced a provision      in the conference report that leaves numerous loopholes that      will render this provision meaningless. Specifically, it      allows drug manufacturers to deny importers access to the      Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved labeling required      for reimportation so that any and all drug companies could--     and probably would--block reimportation of their medications.      Second, a ``sunset'' was added that ends the importation      system five years after it goes into effect. This will limit      private and public sector interest in investing in this      system. Third, the conference language permits the drug      industry to use contracts or agreements to provide financial      disincentives for foreign distributors to reimport to U.S.      importers. Finally, despite the Administration's repeated      requests, the conference requires FDA to pay for the costs      associated with this provision from within resources needed      to perform its other important public     health activities. It is wrong that U.S. citizens pay the      highest prices in the world for medications, leaving many      with no other option than to go abroad to obtain affordable      prescription drugs. But it is also wrong to provide false      hope that this provision will work to address this problem.      Moreover, Congress has thus far failed to pass a meaningful      Medicare prescription drug benefit that will not only provide      price discounts but will insure seniors and people with      disabilities against the catastrophic costs of medications.       On the ``Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act      of 2000,'' which is included in the conference report, there      are two major concerns to the Administration. First, the      restrictions on the ability of the President to initiate new      sanctions and maintain old ones are overly stringent. This      effectively disarms the President's ability to conduct      foreign policy while providing potential targets of U.S.      actions with the time to take countermeasures. Second, the      provisions of the bill affecting travel to Cuba would      significantly set back our people-to-people exchanges that      are in the interest of opening up Cuban society. They also      would preclude travel by technicians and others needed to      conduct normal business by the U.S. Interests Section in      Havana, as well as travel for humanitarian purposes.       With respect to the provision, ``Continued Dumping and      Subsidy Offset Act of 2000,'' the Administration agrees with      the findings that state that unfair trade laws have as their      purpose the restoration of conditions of fair trade. However,      that is the purpose of the anti-dumping and counter-vailing      duties themselves, which accomplish that purpose. By raising      the price of imports they shield domestic producers from      import competition and allow domestic manufacturers to raise      prices, increase production, and improve revenues.      Consequently, distribution of the tariffs themselves to      producers is not necessary to the restoration of conditions      of fair trade. In addition, there are significant concerns      regarding administrative feasibility and consistency with our      trade policy objectives, including the potential for trading      partners to adopt similar mechanisms. Such concerns were      raised and examined with regard to a similar proposal      considered during passage of the Uruguay Round Agreements      Act. That proposal was ultimately rejected.       In addition, the Administration believes the provision      removing the authority of USDA's Undersecretary for Natural      Resources and the Environment has no justification, will      interfere with the agency's ability to manage itself      effectively, and sets a highly undesirable precedent.       The Administration is also disappointed that the bill      prohibits the Secretary of Agriculture from designating any      part of a USDA research lab in Ft. Reno, Oklahoma, as surplus      land, thereby preventing any consideration of returning land      to the Cheyenne-Arapaho tribe. The Secretary should retain      his authority to effectively manage USDA property and      consider its alternative uses.
