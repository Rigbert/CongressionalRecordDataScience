President, I want to associate myself with the remarks of the chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, my chairwoman, Senator Mikulski.  I would add perhaps one particular point; that is, this Senator will be basking in the Sun in Illinois during the recess, and I invite the Senator from Maryland to come join us any time she would like to. But it will not be in ordinary vacation climes; it will be in my home State. I am sure the Senator is going to be spending a lot of time in hers as well.
