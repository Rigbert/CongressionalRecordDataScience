President, reserving the right to object, when I spoke to Senator Toomey about this issue, it personally struck a chord with me. I recognize that we have had this same debate in the Appropriations Committee. Its champion in the committee is Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma, who has at least for 2 years, or maybe longer, suggested the change the Senator from Pennsylvania brings to the floor. I think he made a compelling argument, and I voted with him for the change he wished to see in the law. We did not prevail in the Appropriations Committee--at least didn't prevail in changing the budget rules--but Senator Lankford, with his effort in the committee, has prevailed in changing the allocation of funds.
