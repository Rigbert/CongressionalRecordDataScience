Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.  Mr. Chairman, just to clarify everything, if someone entered the United States illegally, they have committed a Federal misdemeanor. If they overstayed their visa, they have committed a civil grounds of inadmissibility. So the people who snuck under the fence are already criminals, and what this bill does is criminalize the 40 percent who entered legally and did not go home when they were supposed to. And that is fair and that is equal.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster).
