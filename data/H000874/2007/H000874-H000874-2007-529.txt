It is an important question. And the answer to that question is, absolutely. And I am glad that we have this opportunity to clear up any confusion. I want to assure the gentleman, and all Members of the House, that the District of Columbia Voting Rights Act will not violate PAYGO, period. The House just voted to approve the D.C. Voting Rights Act of 2007. We have now proceeded to consideration of H.R. 1906, which amends provisions of the Internal Revenue Code regarding estimated taxes to pay for all costs attendant within the D.C. House Voting Rights Act.                              {time}  1500  While those costs are de minimis, essentially about $1.6 million out of $27 trillion if there is no escalation in government revenues, notwithstanding that, we wanted to adhere to the PAYGO rule, as the gentleman from Indiana has stated and for which he has fought so hard and been a leader on. The rule provides that the text of H.R. 1906 will be incorporated into the D.C. Voting Rights Act when H.R. 1906 is passed; in other words, every Member who voted for the rule voted to honor PAYGO.  The Congressional Budget Office and the Budget Committee have certified that when the text of H.R. 1906 is incorporated into the bill and the bill is engrossed, the bill will comply with the PAYGO rule. The rule further provides that if either bill fails to pass, both bills will be tabled. In other words, if the bill providing the offset to ensure compliance with PAYGO is not added to the bill, the D.C. bill would be rejected.  This process guarantees that two important things will happen, first, that an unmitigated injustice, the denial of voting for the citizens of the District of Columbia, is considered on its merits and remedied; and secondly, that we abide by our commitment to PAYGO.  Again I state, the gentleman from Indiana has been an extraordinarily consistent and strong leader on behalf of that premise.  The House, in conclusion, will not send a bill that does not comply with the PAYGO rule as a result of the rule. And I commend those who voted for the rule to be consistent with our PAYGO pledge.  I thank the gentleman for his question.
