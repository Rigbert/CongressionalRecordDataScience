I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, to ensure that a wilderness designation would not block public access to historic recreation sites, the 1988 law that established the Stephen Mather Wilderness area in the North Cascades National Park provided for a 100-foot-wide, non-wilderness corridor to the upper Stehekin Valley.  Unfortunately, flooding in 1995 and again in 2003 washed away parts of the road, and it remains impassable today.  Representative Doc Hastings' bill, H.R. 2806, restores the intent of Congress by allowing the relocation of the road to a less flood-prone site. This bill does not reduce the amount of wilderness in the park.  It is strongly supported by local officials and by former Senator Dan Evans, who sponsored the 1988 law. When the National Park Service solicited public comments on alternatives for the management of the area, over 90 percent of those comments favored keeping the road open.  I urge my colleagues to join ranking Republican Doc Hastings and Chairman Nick Rahall in supporting this legislation.  I yield back the balance of my time.
