Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor an extraordinary couple that survived one of history's darkest periods to live a vibrant and successful life together. Their tremendous life story is filled with incredible inspiration and hope. In a fitting celebration of their life together, Harry and Hilda Eisen will mark their 60th anniversary by renewing their wedding vows on July 10, 2005.  Harry and Hilda were both born in 1917 in the small Polish village of Ibicza. When Poland was invaded by German Nazis during World War II, their lives became a struggle for survival.  Harry served in the Polish Calvary and eventually became interned in the Auschwitz Concentration Camp. As a forced laborer, Harry worked in the coal mines and other grueling jobs during the 5 years he spent at Auschwitz, before escaping the forced death march in the winter of 1945. Meanwhile, Hilda escaped the Lodz Ghetto internment camp and joined a group of Jewish partisan fighters that fought back against the Nazis.  Following Poland's liberation, Harry and Hilda met up back in Ibicza and in July of 1945 they were married. They subsequently immigrated to America in 1948.  In America, Harry used the money he earned as a sausage-maker to start up a modest chicken business in Arcadia, California. As his business and urban encroachment grew, Harry needed to find another location for his chicken enterprise and settled in Norco, California. As time went by, the once small chicken business, now named Norco Ranch, Inc.,continued to grow as a producer and distributor of shell eggs and other egg products in the Southern California marketplace and beyond.  Eventually, Norco Ranch successfully became one of the largest suppliers to the retail food chains in Southern California, employing nearly 500 people throughout the Inland Empire. Additionally, the business that once started with 100 chickens grew to have 8 million chickens producing egg products.  In 2000, Harry sold Norco Ranch so that he could focus his energies on his philanthropic interests. Harry is a founder of the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C. and was President of the Lodzer Organization, which is a non-profit philanthropic association of Holocaust Survivors.  Having lost their original marriage certificate after the war, Harry and Hilda decided to renew their wedding vows to commemorate their 60th anniversary. Their grandson Michael Rubinstein, who will shortly be ordained as a rabbi, will perform the ceremony and provide them with a new marriage certificate. They will also be joined by their four children, Ruth, Mary, Howard and Frances.  I want to congratulate Harry and Hilda on this wonderful occasion and end by sharing with you the sentimental words that accompanied the ceremony announcement: ``Each believing the other to be a giver of love, a sharer of sorrow, a bearer of joy and a reason for life, they decided to renew their wedding vows.''                          ____________________
