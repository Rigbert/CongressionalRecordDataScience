Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the rule to table the motion of the gentleman from Louisiana. I have a great deal of respect for him, but I would point out to my colleagues that on October 22 last year, the International Trade Commission unanimously, three Republicans and three Democrats, found that illegally dumped steel caused serious injury to the United States of America and its workers. They were right.  Since 1977, we have lost 34.5 million tons of capacity. But, moreover, we lost many jobs. The gentleman from Louisiana mentioned earlier in his remarks that people in Korea and Japan and Brazil are upset over the President's implementation of the ITC decision. I would point out that some of the 72,567 Americans who have lost their job at bankrupt or closed companies in places like Dunkirk, New York, Vineyard, Utah, Gadsden, Alabama, Sterling, Illinois, and Sand Springs, Oklahoma, are even more upset, and they are our responsibility to protect.  The President acted appropriately on March 5 by imposing 30 percent tariffs. We ought not to set the President's program back.  Additionally, I am concerned, as I address the House today, that hundreds of exemptions have been asked for by our trading partners, and hundreds more have been asked for. And now we have 1,200 exemptions that have been requested, and the Secretary of the Treasury has indicated on a recent trip to Europe that a significant number of them might be approved.  I would hope that the administration does not follow through on the implication of the Secretary's remarks, that they hold firm, and that exemptions are only granted in the case where there is no other U.S. alternative for the products made.
