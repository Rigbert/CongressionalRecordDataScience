President, I am pleased to join Senators Lugar, Biden, and Chafee in introducing the ``Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998.'' This legislation embodies a motto we take to heart in Vermont: ``Act Locally, Think Globally.'' From our campaign to ban landmines, Vermonters again learned the power of this maxim.  Vermonters understand the social, economic and environmental impacts of deforestation. We started this century with 75 percent of Vermont forestland cleared for agriculture. Today, more than 80 percent of Vermont is forested. Rebuilding our forests and the Vermont tradition of living close to the land has helped Vermonters recognize that our healthy forests are a valued legacy which holds the key to achieving prosperity. This is the purpose of the Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998.  The Tropical Forest Conservation Act will authorize more than $350 million over three years to enable developing countries to restructure their debt and use the new resources to protect their tropical forests. The Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998 gives each country the power to protect its own resources without having to risk the health of its forests.  Many developing countries have resorted to rapid development, including clear-cutting and slash-and-burn stripping of tropical forests, as ways to try to escape their debts. These forests contain a majority of the Earth's biological resources which provide the ingredients for many lifesaving medicines as well as providing us with the genetic sources to maintain healthy agricultural crops.  Protection of these tropical forests also gives us with an opportunity to address one of the most critical global environmental issues facing us in the next century--global climate change. These forests serve important carbon sinks which store greenhouse gases and help regulate global temperatures.  If we are going to reap these benefits though, we have to let nature do its work. This requires creative approaches to offer incentives to these developing countries to conserve forest resources for theirs, and our, children and grandchildren. The Tropical Forest Conservation Act will help stem the rapid rate of deforestation and degradation of these sensitive ecosystems.  As a Vermonter, I respect the importance of forests and the tough decisions which often have to be made in order to preserve them. I believe that this bill will make those tough decisions easier for countries which possess some of our world's most precious resources--tropical forests.                                 ______                                       By
