Mr. Speaker, the American people want tax relief. They want lower taxes, but Mr. Speaker, the American people want a tax cut that goes to the people who need it most, American working families. The Republican tax bill is a boom for Wall Street, but a bust for Main Street.  The Republican tax bill gives little relief to the working people, people struggling to pay a mortgage, a car loan, their credit card bills, and send their kids to college. The Republican tax bill gives most of the tax breaks to the wealthiest people in America. Almost 60 percent of the Republican tax credits goes to the the wealthiest 5 percent of Americans, people who on average earn $250,000 a year.  That is not right, it is not fair, and it is not just. That is not what the American people want. Democrats want a tax cut for the middle class, for working families. These are the people who deserve tax relief. Let us not give away the store to millionaires like Rush Limbaugh and other yacht-owning junk bond traders and Rolls Royce drivers. Say no to the Republican tax break bill.                          ____________________
