Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to our region have been exceptional. After serving 24 years on the Riverside County Board of Supervisors, my good friend John Tavaglione will be stepping down.  John is a fourth generation resident of Riverside County and has dedicated much of his life to improving the Inland Empire region. John received his bachelor's degree in business administration from California Baptist University and is a proud U.S. Army veteran. His professional career spanned nearly 25 years as a commercial real estate executive. Prior to his election to the Board of Supervisors, he served on the Riverside City Council and was a member of the Riverside Public Utilities Commission. In 1994, John was elected to represent the Second District on the Riverside County Board of Supervisors.  As a member of the Board of Supervisors, John has been credited for his leadership in regional transportation issues, community and economic development, parks and open space preservation, and for his strong fiscal and organizational management. In 2010, John was selected to serve as President of the California State Association of Counties by California's 58 counties. Over the years, John and his wife Jan have graciously helped to send hundreds of students to college by hosting an annual fundraiser where all proceeds go towards scholarships for graduating high school seniors in his district.  John has contributed immensely to the betterment of our region and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and my friend. To conclude, Mr. Speaker I want to thank John for his service to the Inland Empire--his dedication, insight and passion will be greatly missed.                          ____________________
