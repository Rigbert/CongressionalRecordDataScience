 President, I rise today to give recognition to one of the Commonwealth's most unique and historic areas, Laurel County, KY, which celebrated its 185th birthday on March 5, 2011. Located in Kentucky's eastern coal country, Laurel County was named after the trees that grow along the banks of the Laurel River. A county full of rich history and tradition dating back before the Civil War years, Laurel County first established their government and began business in 1826. Organized through a general assembly, it was the 18th county created in the Commonwealth.  London, the largest town in Laurel County, also celebrated its 185th birthday this year on March 6. Although named after London, England, the town's festive characteristics gave it a name in its own light. In proximity to beautiful landscapes which were explored by the likes of Daniel Boone and Levi Jackson, the two parks that bear their names, the Daniel Boone National Park and the Levi Jackson Wilderness Road State Park, have been hailed as two of the most sought-after vacation spots in the country. Cumberland Falls State Resort Park as well as numerous hiking and bike trails also showcase some of the best scenery the Bluegrass State has to offer. Well-known names such as national best-selling author Silas House, former University of Kentucky star and NBA basketball player Jeff Sheppard, and the infamous Kentucky Fried Chicken founder Colonel Harland David Sanders have all called Laurel County home.  Whether you are sampling a taste of fried chicken at the World Chicken Festival, enjoying a country music show at the Renfro Valley Entertainment Center on a Friday night, or taking in the scenery of the challenging Redbud Ride bike trail, Laurel County has a little something for everyone. Maybe it is a combination of these one-of-a-kind attractions, the pristine beauty of its natural landscape, and its strong sense of southern Kentucky hospitality that makes Laurel County so welcoming and intriguing. Whatever it is, it keeps people coming back for more.  Mr. President, 185 years later, these vacation crossroads still tell a story. Atop the peaks overlooking the Cumberland Gap where the small, yet crucial Battle of Wildcat Mountain was fought in the Civil War to the crystal clear waters of Laurel Lake, I am sure there will be many more stories to tell in the future.  I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating Laurel County, Kentucky's 185th birthday. This is an exciting time for the people of Laurel County and the Commonwealth, and I send them my congratulations and best wishes for the future.                          ____________________
