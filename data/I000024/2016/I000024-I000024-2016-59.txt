President, I have a very personal interest in a vote that is coming up on Zika, and I wish to share my thoughts on that.  Today we have the opportunity to provide the funding to help combat the mosquito-borne Zika virus that has hit Florida and some other southern States. As of this week, there have been 49 travel-related cases of the Zika virus in Florida and 576 travel-related cases altogether. Within those cases, 80 are pregnant women who have been infected with the virus. This is extremely concerning since the Zika virus has been linked to severe birth defects in children born from mothers who contracted the Zika virus. Zika has created a public health emergency that can't be ignored.  This isn't the first time we have taken up this vote. In June, Senate Democrats blocked the passage of the conference report, claiming that funds did not need to be offset. The $1.1 billion provided in funding in the conference report will be used to fight the Zika virus and prevent it from spreading. This is the same amount as the Senate-passed bill in which every Democrat voted in favor. All the Democrats voted for it. Republicans have put together a responsible funding package that includes $750 million in offsets, with strong oversight and control to ensure that funds are being used properly.  There has been a lot of discussion and a lot of things we are saying here on the floor and to the public that the public doesn't understand. They can't be expected to understand; they are too busy out trying to make a living. But when they hear things like this, they shake their heads and they say: What is wrong with that system up there?  I say this because there is a little girl who happens to be my sister's granddaughter. Her name is Callie Hamilton. Callie Hamilton has lived for some time in Florida, and she is pregnant. She has called me several times. She said: I don't understand it. You have Democrats who are saying ``We don't want to do something to save the lives of these pregnant mothers in Florida and elsewhere unless you also fund Planned Parenthood and some of the other programs.'' Everything gets all mixed up, and because of the sense of urgency, it is now a vehicle for everybody else to hitchhike on.  Let me tell my colleagues, when I was asked the question by my own great-niece, who is pregnant and living in Florida, saying, Why is it that people aren't too concerned about the political politics of a vote when this is different from any other virus vote we have taken? We have had many, and normally there is some question as to what caused it, some question as to whether the solution is a viable solution when, in fact, in this case, it is. There is no question about it.  There are two things that are factual about this that we have not seen before. First of all, the virus is contracted through mosquitoes. We all know that. Nobody refutes that. The second thing is, you can kill mosquitoes, and everybody knows that. Now, whether the amount is $750 million or whatever the amount is--it doesn't really matter; even if you are out there with a very small amount and you just kill several million mosquitoes, that could save lives, and it could be my grand-niece, Callie Hamilton.  So this is different. I hope--and I am going to encourage my Republican and Democratic friends alike, when this vote comes up to consider, that this isn't something to put something else on. This is something that--we can immediately get in there and eradicate a bunch of mosquitoes and save lives and very likely prevent this from happening. I hope they will make an exception on this. It doesn't make any difference about offsets. It doesn't make any difference about the cost when we know we can save lives. This isn't something that is up in the air and debatable; these are facts we are aware of.  I wasn't going to talk about that, but I do think it is necessary for us to concentrate on what we are really doing since we are now back here. We have been gone for several weeks. I think the country has probably benefited from that--I don't know--but we areback now and we have an opportunity to do some things.                                  WRDA  Mr. President, I chair a committee and have chaired a committee that is called the Environment and Public Works Committee. It is a committee that--sometimes, somewhat jokingly, I say: Now we will hear from a committee that actually does things. We do. We had the bill that was the FAST Act, the highway bill, the first one we have had in 17 years. It is one on which we all got along. We had Democrats and Republicans and passed it almost unanimously out of our committee, and almost unanimously we had support on this floor.  Then we came up with Frank Lautenberg's chemical safety act. That is an interesting one because there are a lot of Democrats who are opposed to that to begin with, yet there is no regulation over the use of chemicals--none whatsoever. So our manufacturing base has disappeared, many of them going to countries where they know they can define what a chemical is. There are a lot of liberals around who say: Let's just oppose all chemicals. Well, obviously, if we don't have chemicals, we can't manufacture, and that affects everyone. So we have people going overseas now. By the way, I have personally talked to them since we have that under control. For the first time in 4 years, we are getting people to come back to this country to manufacture. So we achieved that chemical bill.  Working together with Senator Boxer--this is interesting because when they talk about the most conservative Members of the U.S. Senate, I am always in that crowd, and Barbara Boxer is in the most liberal group, and yet we worked together on the things we are supposed to be doing. We have that old, worn-out document that nobody reads anymore called the Constitution, and it says that we are supposed to be defending America and doing infrastructure. So that is what this is all about.  We have the WRDA bill, the Water Resources Development Act. It is coming up. If we get on that, it is going to benefit everyone. I worry about it because we get to something that is good for everyone--Zika is a good example--and then all of a sudden opposition comes up, and you don't know what the source of that opposition is, but it is there.  Briefly, I want to cover these things because of the significance of the WRDA bill, the water resources bill. We talk about five different areas. One is the Corps projects. We know about the Corps of Engineers and its projects. There is one Member of the Senate who has had efforts and dogs in that fight--dams and levees. Certainly the occupier of the chair and I both know some of these problems that exist in our State of Oklahoma.  The EPA water infrastructure on both drinking water and wastewater is something that--particularly in my State, a State that is primarily rural, we have a lot of small towns. They don't know how in the world they are going to come up with the massive amounts of millions of dollars to somehow do something to stop the unfunded mandates that come from government, primarily the EPA. When I was mayor of Tulsa, that was the biggest problem we had because we had unfunded mandates. We needed things to be done, and we were not able to get them done.  We also deal with the restoration programs and the coal ash programs.  So let's start with the Corps of Engineers. In their part of the bill, we authorized 29 projects recommended by the chief of engineers that will provide benefits that significantly exceed the cost of the projects. These include important harbor-deepening projects for Charleston, SC; Jacksonville, FL; and Brownsville, TX, as well as significant flood protection projects in Kansas, Missouri, California, North Carolina, Louisiana, and elsewhere.  Chart No. 1 shows--this happens to be the Port of Charleston, and it gives you an idea of what we have.  We also authorized the next phase of the Everglades restoration project. Certainly the two Senators from Florida have this as a great concern. I have been on this road going through the Everglades, and they have problems there. It is one of the real gems we have in this country, and we do address that in a very cost-effective way.  In addition to new projects, the bill modifies some existing projects that need additional congressional authority before they can continue. These include critical flood control projects in Missouri, Kansas, Kentucky, and Arizona, as well as critical navigation safety projects in Texas.  The bill also makes policy changes on the recommendations of Senators, project sponsors, and the users of our water transportation infrastructure. This photo I have in the Chamber gives you an idea, and I have been not to the one in Ohio, but I have been to the one in Oklahoma. A lot of people don't know--I am sure both the Chair and I are aware of this, but a lot of people are not aware that we in the State of Oklahoma are navigable. We have ports, including the Port of Catoosa. It looks just like this when you go through the lock and dams, and they are about in that condition, and when that stops, everything stops.  We have some ideas on how to do this using local sponsors. We have people who are users of the navigation way throughout America who want to be able to update and make sure that they are going to be safe and that they are going to continue to operate. But the law does not allow us to do that, so we correct that in this bill. So we talk about how local sponsors can make changes so levee districts are not caught in bureaucratic nightmares when they attempt to repair levees, which means everything stops. So drought-stricken communities can increase reservoir storage capacity.  When the Corps rebuilds a levy after a disaster, we now allow local levy districts to increase the level of flood protection at their own expense. We actually did that 2 years ago in the last WRDA bill, and I might add that I was proud of us when we came back in and we were able to get back on a 2-year cycle. We are supposed to do a water resources development bill every 2 years. We haven't been doing it. We didn't do it during the years the Democrats controlled the Senate. But right now we are doing that, and that is one of the benefits that came from the last bill.  In WRDA 2016, we expand the current authority of the Corps to accept funds from non-Federal interests to expedite permits for rail transportation projects. Overall, we estimate that the Corps of Engineers' section of the bill will cost about $6 billion over a 10-year period.  The second group is called dams and levees. We address this in the--just imagine. This is the Ohio River. A minute ago, we showed one of the levees. This is just like that levee, except this one erupted. There is a term that is used called the ``high-hazard potential.'' When a classification of ``high hazard'' takes place--we have about 14,726 potentially high-hazard dams in the United States. The definition of ``high hazard'' is that if it breaks, people will die, and we can see that people will die. This is serious stuff. Anyway, we now have that in this bill so that we will be able to protect those and to do something about the high-hazard dams and infrastructure that we have, and the levee system.  Under our legislation the Federal Emergency Management Agency is authorized to help rehabilitate dams in States where safety officials have determined them to have a high hazard potential. FEMA is authorized to come in and do the work. CBO estimates that implementing these dam and levee safety programs will cost $401 million over 10 years.  In our substitute we have added the Bureau of Indian Affairs dam safety program for dams in Indian Country at a cost of $129 million. This is based on S. 2717, which Senator Barrasso moved through the Indian Affairs Committee with unanimous support. Senator Barrasso, whom we heard from just a few minutes ago, was one step ahead of everybody else when he moved this legislation through the committee that I chaired, the Indian Affairs Committee. We had unanimous support for this program to be expanded in Indian Country.  The third issue is the drinking water and waste water infrastructure. I spent a lot of my time going into the small communities. As I said, years ago I had a hard job. I was mayor of a major city. At that time the biggest problem we had was unfunded mandates--the Federal Government coming along. We tried to stop that, but this bill goes a long way toward making sure that thesmaller communities, the poorer and rural communities, have access to resolving the problems of these mandates. It is primarily in the drinking water and waste water infrastructure. We are working on that now.  S. 2848 includes several million dollars to address lead emergencies and public health consequences for those emergencies. For example, we provide $70 million to capitalize the new Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, the WIFIA Act, so that we can provide secured loans for water and waste water. That is what we are in the process of doing.  In the fourth area, restoration programs, we have four regional restoration programs that we reported out of committee. These include Senator Kirk's Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and the Lake Those Initiative that was put forward by Senators Heller, Reid, Boxer and Feinstein. So we are addressing these restoration programs.  The final area is coal ash. Some people don't know about coal ash. They think of it as being something that is dangerous and that environmentalists shouldn't like, when in fact coal ash is a critical ingredient for making concrete for roads and bridges. It is more durable and less expensive than the alternatives, and many States actually require fly ash to be used in their projects. We have a whole section on coal ash which includes consensus legislation to allow the EPA to review and approve the State permitting program for coal ash disposable units. This is something that is very effective. There is no other environmental regulation solely enforcing this very issue we are talking about. So this is our chance.  I know the next vote is going to be on the Zika virus--I assume--and I do encourage people to keep in mind that when they vote on that they are voting on something I don't remember ever seeing before, but it is something where we know a government program will work. We know it comes from mosquitoes, and we know how to eradicate mosquitoes. So let's get with it and quit talking about who we are offending politically. Let's just get it done.  In the meantime, let's be lining up for a major bill that we need to be doing. Hopefully, we will be doing it during this work period. It is the WRDA bill.  With that I yield the floor.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
