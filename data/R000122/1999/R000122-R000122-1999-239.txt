President, we also commend the Senator from West Virginia for his amendment, and I concur with the chairman's remarks. This would not materially increase in any way the costs associated with the Montgomery programs, and it would also provide additional opportunities for service members to pursue higher education. It is something that is consistent with the legislation, and it is an amendment which we support with enthusiasm.
