 President, I was pleased to join with the distinguished Chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Stevens, in offering an amendment that has been accepted as part of the managers' package in the Fiscal Year 2006 Defense appropriations bill.  Specifically, this amendment would require the Office of Management and Budget, along with the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security, to conduct a study on ``improving the response of the Federal Government to disasters.''  I believe this study is essential as it is clear to me that there were breakdowns at every level in our response to Hurricane Katrina.  Moreover, it is critical that the Federal Government improve its response to future disasters.
