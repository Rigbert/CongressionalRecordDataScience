He and I have been working closely on an agenda for the coming year for the Judiciary Committee. As always, the agenda will reflect not only the needs of the Senate, but the friendship that the two of us have had for well over 20 years.  I congratulate Senator Hatch for his continuing leadership in improving our copyright, trademark, and patent law. Our intellectual property laws are important engines for our economy, fueling the creative energy responsible for America's global leadership in the software, movie, music, and high-tech industries.  The bill we considered today contains amendments recommended to us by the Copyright Office. I commend the Register of Copyrights, Marybeth Peters, for the expertise she brings to her office and the assistance she brings to us. At the end of my statement, I ask that a letter from Marybeth Peters in support of this legislation be printed in the Record.  (See exhibit 1.)
