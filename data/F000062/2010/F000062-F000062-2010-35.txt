 President, on September 9, a gas pipeline underneath a neighborhood in San Bruno, California, just south of San Francisco, exploded, turning a quiet residential area into something resembling a war zone.  The resulting inferno damaged or destroyed 55 homes, injured 66, and killed an estimated 7 people. Three likely victims have yet to be identified.  This tragedy shows the heavy toll, in death and destruction, when high pressure natural gas pipelines fail. The risk is unacceptably high.  So today I join with my colleague, Senator Barbara Boxer, to introduce the Strengthening Pipeline Safety and Enforcement Act of 2010.  This legislation is drafted to repair clear shortcomings in pipeline oversight that have, unfortunately, come to our attention as the result of a devastating tragedy in San Bruno, CA.  Specifically, this legislation would improve pipeline safety and oversight by expanding Federal inspection capacity; increasing fines for safety violations; adding information to the national pipeline mapping system, to assure greater transparency for the public and the regulator; closing jurisdictional loopholes that allow gathering lines, carbon dioxide pipelines, and biofuel pipelines to operate without oversight; requiring widespread adoption of automatic shut-off valves that could shut off a pipeline immediately in emergency situations; requiring that high-pressure pipelines be inspected on a regular basis with either internal instrumented internal inspection devices, known as smart pigs, or other inspection methods that are certified to be just as effective; prohibiting pipelines that cannot be inspected with the best, most-modern techniques from operating at high pressure; requiring regulators to consider seismicity and the age of pipes when identifying pipelines that deserve the highest level of oversight; and establishing the first standards for effective leak detection systems in natural gas pipelines.  Together, Senator Boxer and I believe these improvements to pipeline safety will bring about a safer national pipeline system in which disasters, such as the tragedy in San Bruno, can be prevented.  At 6:11 p.m. on September 9, 2010, a 30-inch steel natural gas pipeline exploded in San Bruno, California.  The blast in the Crestmoor neighborhood two miles west of San Francisco International Airport shook the ground like an earthquake. The fire raged for more than two hours and burned 15 acres.  The resulting loss of life, serious injuries and property damage are heartbreaking.  Two days after the fire, I visited San Bruno. I walked through the devastation with Christopher Hart, vice chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board.  I was struck by what I saw: Homes leveled or charred; cars burned out; the burned and bent pipeline--now a key part of the investigation--which revealed the intensity of the heat; and a gaping crater that demonstrated the size of the initial blast.  I was saddened by the disaster and I am determined to act to prevent this type of catastrophe from recurring.  I left San Bruno once again impressed by the professionalism of the NTSB.  Their team was on site and in charge, and I am confident they will work meticulously to find out what caused this deadly disaster.  I am confident that their feedback will make pipelines safer in the future.  But I also left San Bruno determined to introduce legislation to address the known weaknesses in our pipeline oversight system.  Let me explain the key provisions in the Bill. First, we propose to double the number of Federal pipeline safety inspectors.  The Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration currently has 100 pipeline inspectors, responsible for 217,306 miles of interstate pipeline. Each inspector is responsible for 2,173 miles of pipeline--the distance from San Francisco to Chicago.  The vast amount of pipeline per inspector has led to lax oversight of pipeline operators, according to NTSB investigations.  NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman testified in June that:       NTSB is concerned that the level of . . . oversight      currently being exercised is not uniformly applied by . . .      PHMSA to ensure that the risk-based safety programs are      effective. The NTSB believes that . . . PHMSA must establish      an aggressive oversight program that thoroughly examines each      operator's decision-making process for each element of its      integrity management program.  Doubling the number of inspectors will still require each inspector to oversee more than 1,000 miles of pipeline, but the thoroughness of inspection and oversight will be far greater.  Second, this legislation will require deployment of electronic valves capable of automatically shutting off the gas in a fire or other emergency.  I was shocked to learn that it took hours to turn off the gas in San Bruno.  Manually operated valves had to be located, buildings had to be opened, and workers had to physically turn off the valves. Every minute that passed, a flaming inferno burned on.  In today's era we have electronic water faucets, and furnaces all deploy electronic valves to shut off the supply of natural gas in an emergency.  If electronic valves can be deployed in our homes and offices, I believe they should be deployed on gas pipelines pumping millions of cubic feet of fuel through urban areas. Gas pipeline safety technology should be brought into the modern era.  Third, this legislation will require inspections by ``smart pigs'' in all pipes, or the use of an inspection method certified to be equally effective at finding corrosion.  Department of Transportation accident statistics over the past decade, 2000-2009, identify corrosion as the leading cause of all reported pipeline accidents.  We need to inspect our pipes to find problems before they cause deadly explosions. Every pipe needs effective inspection, regardless of age or design.  Fourth, if natural gas pipelines cannot be inspected using the most effective inspection technology, this bill would require operation at lower pressure.  This precautionary approach to pipeline operations assures that pipelines more likely to have undetected problems are operated at lower risk.  Department of Transportation experts believe that a breach or other major problem with a pipeline operating at lower pressure is more likely to produce a leak instead of a catastrophic or deadly explosion.  The cause of the San Bruno pipeline fire remains under investigation, but we know that this pipe could not be inspected using the most modern smart pigs, and we know it was operating at high pressure.  Had this law been in place, either this pipe would have been inspected by other means certified to be just as effective as a smart pig, or it would have been operating at a pressure far less likely to cause the kind of catastrophe we saw.  Fifth, this legislation will require the Secretary of Transportation to consider pipe age and the seismicity of an area when identifying pipelines deserving the highest level of safety oversight.  Today, regulators consider a pipeline's proximity to homes and buildings. Other risk factors, such as age of pipe, are not a defining consideration.  We know in San Bruno that this pipe was very old.  This old pipe had unique twists and turns, and numerous welds that I was told would not be allowed on a pipe installed today. NTSB identified failed welds as the cause of another major pipeline disaster in 2009, so these deserve special attention.  Sixth, this legislation would require standards for natural gas leak detection equipment and methods to identify pipeline leaks as expeditiously as technologically possible.  In San Bruno, some have asserted that they smelled gas for weeks. Records are still being checked to determine whether consumers reported these leaks, but no equipment on the pipeline clearly demonstrates that no leak existed.  Finally, this legislation adopts a number of commonsense provisions proposed last week by Secretary of Transportation LaHood to improve pipeline safety, including increasing civil penalties for safety violations; expending data collection to be included in the national pipeline mapping system; closing jurisdictional loopholes to assure greater oversight of unregulated pipelines; and requiring consideration of a firm's safety record when considering its request for regulatory waivers.  Senator Boxer and I introduce this legislation today in order to initiate quick action to make our pipeline system safer.  We have put forward our best ideas to improve inspection, address old pipes, and advance modern safety technology. We hope to improve these ideas as new information comes forward about the San Bruno accident.  We look forward to working with the Department of Transportation and the Senate Commerce Committee to move and improve this legislation expeditiously.
