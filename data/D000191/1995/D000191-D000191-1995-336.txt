 Well, it is strange. It is strange that we stood on this floor 14 months ago, backed by credible economists who said, ``Today, as you vote on the NAFTA agreement the Mexican peso is overvalued by 20 to 25 percent to make them look more attractive as a partner for the United States, to make them look as though their currency is stable. But it's inevitable after the passage of NAFTA they will have to devalue the peso by 20 to 25 percent.''  And now we are told by the Secretary of the Treasury, a former partner in one of the major investment firms in this country, that no one could have anticipated this. Well, the economists we talked to, who gave us a very critical analysis of NAFTA, could certainly anticipate it, did, and we are right on the money. In fact, they were a little bit overly optimistic about Mexico because we are talking the free market says the Mexican peso should actually go down 40 to 50 percent, and whatever happened to free-market forces? Where is the free market when we need it? If the market says the Mexican peso should be worth half as much, should the United States Government intervene to artificially prop it up?
