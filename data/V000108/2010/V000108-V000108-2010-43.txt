On Saturday, April 24, 2010, the Gary NAACP will hold its 45th Annual Life Membership Banquet at the Genesis Convention Center in downtown Gary, Indiana.  This annual event is a major fundraiser for the Gary NAACP. The funds generated through this event directly support the organization's many outstanding programs and advocacy efforts. Through its membership and the support of the community, the Gary NAACP is able to serve the people of Northwest Indiana and continue the mission started by the national organization in 1909, working diligently to combat injustice, discrimination, and unfair treatment for all people in today's society. In addition, the banquet serves to update and keep the community aware of the NAACP's activities and to formally honor its new life members.  The keynote speaker at this year's event will be Mr. Herman Boone, a retired high school teacher and coach, who is most well-known for coaching integrated football teams at T.C. Williams High School, in Alexandria, Virginia. Many will recall Denzel Washington's memorable portrayal of Coach Boone in the movieRemember the Titans. I join the Gary NAACP in welcoming Mr. Boone to Northwest Indiana.  This year, the Gary NAACP will honor six outstanding individuals from Northwest Indiana, who will join the hundreds of other outstanding civil, community, and religious leaders who have previously been recognized as life members. For 2010, the distinguished individuals who will be inducted as life members of the Gary NAACP are: Vanessa Allen, Anna Connor, Geneva Osawe Gonzales, Dr. Danita Johnson Hughes, Hattie McCune, and Cheron Reed.  Madam Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in paying tribute to the newest life members of the Gary NAACP, as well as Attorney Karen Pulliam, the current Gary NAACP president, and all members of the organization for their extraordinary efforts and tremendous leadership. These outstanding men and women have worked tirelessly to improve the quality of life for all residents of Indiana's First Congressional District, and for that they are to be commended.                          ____________________
