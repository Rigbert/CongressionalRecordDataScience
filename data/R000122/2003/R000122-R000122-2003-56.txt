President, I rise to offer an amendment to ensure that our troops in Iraq and other dangerous areas throughout the world, many of whom are Reservists and members of the National Guard, have the equipment they need to protect themselves. In particular, I would like to discuss the uparmored Humvees which soldiers need to protect themselves from the threat of RPGs and mines and weapons that are inflicting casualties today as we speak in Iraq.  To effectively carry out the mission, Army officials have said that they need more Humvees, uparmored Humvees. I believe them.
