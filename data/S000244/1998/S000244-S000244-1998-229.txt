Speaker, we are saddened to learn of the passing of one of America's great pioneers, Rear Admiral Alan Shepard. Admiral Shepard leaves an enduring legacy of heroism, perseverance, and dedication to the exploration of space ad service to his country.  Admiral Shepard served as a Navy fighter pilot and test pilot before being selected as one of the first group of astronauts in 1959. As the commander of Freedom 7, Admiral Shepard became the first American to venture into space.  Following his historic flight, Admiral Shepard was told he would never fly into space again. But he would not be deterred. Ten years later, he commanded Apollo 14 and was the fifth American--the fifth person--to walk on the Moon.  Those who have worked with Admiral Shepard in both the formulation of space policy and oversight of America's space program came to appreciate his wise counsel and fine wit as he educated us on the complex issues involved. I am confident that his contributions to America's space program will not be forgotten by his countrymen.  Admiral Shepard also served his country outside of the cockpit. Following his retirement from NASA and the U.S. Navy in 1974, he brought his determination and leadership to down-to-Earth goals, becoming a successful businessman and raising money for college scholarships so young Americans could grow up to become scientists and engineers. He was on the Board of Directors for both the Houston School for Deaf Children and the National Space Institute.  This afternoon, Admiral Shepard's spacecraft, ``Freedom 7'' will arrive at the National Air and Space Museum where it will be on display in remembrance of not only his historic first flight into space, but of the lasting contributions of this great American to his country.  And now, Admiral Shepard has joined his fellow crewman of Apollo 14--the late Stuart Roosa--and we wish him fair winds and following seas, and offer our condolences to his wife Louise, and his daughters Laura, Alice and Julie.                          ____________________
