President, I rise today to recognize Professor Joe Wilkins' contributions to the State of Illinois and our country.  Professor Wilkins will retire from the University of Illinois in May 2003. He will officially become a ``University of Illinois Professor Emeritus of Management'' which is an accomplishment in and of itself, but is only one facet of his career.  Professor Wilkins has been a very effective teacher. He received an ``Outstanding Teacher'' award selected by a vote of the University student body. His graduate course in International Business was chosen by students in the College of Business and Management as their most valuable class. Additionally, during 2002 Professor Wilkins received the highest evaluation of all the faculty by students in the college.  Prior to his teaching career, Professor Wilkins served with distinction as a captain in the United States Air Force. While serving he was repeatedly decorated for heroism in combat. His many decorations include the Silver Star and two Purple Hearts, which were awarded for his twice being wounded in combat. Despite being injured in combat, he continues to run at least one 26.2-mile marathon a year and enjoys scuba diving and sky-diving.  In addition to his teaching and service to many organizations, Professor Wilkins has responded for over 30 years to the needs of his home community--Springfield, IL. Some of the many services he has provided to Springfield include being a regular blood donor andproviding flights to needy persons requiring medical assistance. He has donated more than 15 gallons of blood including 59 pints at the Central Illinois Community Blood Bank in Springfield.  Professor Wilkins has held positions with both the State of Illinois and the city of Springfield. As an operations research analyst for the State of Illinois he helped analyze managerial operations. Additionally, he has served in many capacities and consulted on multiple issues for the city of Springfield. Most notably, in 1982 he took an academic leave from the university to serve for 13 months as Comptroller of Springfield. On numerous occasions since then he has provided management advice to the city of Springfield.  Professor Wilkins has been a teacher and role model to thousands of undergraduate and graduate students. I am sure the University of Illinois will miss him greatly. Professor Wilkins has had a lifetime of community service in which he established a reputation of personal integrity and demonstrated courage. He is a distinguished citizen and deserves to be recognized for all of his contributions to society.                          ____________________
