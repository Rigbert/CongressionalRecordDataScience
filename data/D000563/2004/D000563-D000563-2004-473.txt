And the people who can come up with the dollars want to get paid more for coming up with them in terms of interest. As the interest goes up that is being paid for those holding our debt overseas, it runs up the interest rates in America in terms of how we can expand our businesses.  So we have lost the jobs. We have lost the manufacturing. And with interest rate pressure going up from all of the debt, we are making it more difficult for businesses to rebound, build in America, and create American jobs.  Is the Senator from Iowa aware of the figures given by Senator Kent Conrad on the Budget Committee that by 2009, every American will have as their personal share of our American mortgage, our American debt, $35,283, so that the debt tax from the Bush administration on every individual American will be over $35,000.  I ask my friend from Iowa if he believes the people in his State, let aloneany other State, have a notion that President Bush's failed economic policy is building up the mortgage on every single American and American family for years to come.
