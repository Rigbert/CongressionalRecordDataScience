President, we expect to complete action on the Defense authorization bill during tomorrow's session. Additionally, the majority leader filed cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 1917, the Middle Class Tax Cut Act of 2011. If no agreement is reached, this vote will be Friday morning.                          ____________________
