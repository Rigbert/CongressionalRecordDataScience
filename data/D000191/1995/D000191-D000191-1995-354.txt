Speaker, we have spent a great deal of time this week debating the Federal budget. I believe all Members can agree on the need to eliminate unjustifiable spending. At least one item in the Department of Defense budget falls into this category: the Pentagon's huge fleet of VIP aircraft. I have joined with 10 of my colleagues in introducing legislation to sell off some of these ``generals' jets,'' which would result in a budget savings of at least $130 to $200 million a year.  The Department of Defense has a fleet of about 600 aircraft that are used to transport senior military personnel and civilian officials. About 500 fixed-wing planes and 100 helicopters perform administrative support missions. These aircraft do not include the Presidential aircraft, the 89th Military Airlift Wing, such as Air Force One, nor are they used for operational transport of troops. Rather, they are used for airlift transportation in support of command, installation, or management functions.  The General Accounting Office found that size of the administrative aircraft fleet--often called Operational Support Aircraft--far exceeds the wartime requirements, even according to the Pentagon's own estimates. Only 48 OSA were used ``in theater'' during the gulf war. This suggests that OSA aircraft's main role is not wartime, but peacetime. Even in the United States, the gulf war saw the services using much less than one-half of their inventory. The Commission on Roles and Missions also recommended reducing the size of the OSA fleet. In 1993, the Joint Chiefs report concluded that OSA inventories exceed wartime requirements. The Air Force concurred with the Joint Chiefs in 1994.  However, nothing has yet been done to eliminate the excess aircraft.  The public first heard about the aircraft issue last fall when a high-ranking Air Force general made a very expensive flight from Italy to Colorado. Although the flight was made for administrative purposes, and much less expensive commercial flights were available, a single general and his aide spent more than $100,000 for the trip. The Air Force is even using their OSA planes to fly Air Force cadets to Hawaii to watch football games.  Perks at the Pentagon are no more justifiable than perks in any other agency of the Federal Government. If Congress is to have any hope of balancing the budget during the coming decade, we must focus our attention on reducing budget outlays. This means ending some programs that have little justification. Our bill would offer the American people significant reduction in spending that could either reduce the Federal debt or fund other, more critical spending priorities.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in bringing high-flying generals down to Earth. Let's save taxpayer dollars by paring this Pentagon perk.                          ____________________
