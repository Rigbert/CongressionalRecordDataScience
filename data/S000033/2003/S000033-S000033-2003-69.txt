 Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding, and I think the problem, Mr. Chairman, is when the gentleman indicates that other people are also impacted negatively by this process. It suggests that the process we worked on today, or that my colleague and others engaged in, was a faulty process. It is not my intention to bring this body to a halt, and I will not ask for another motion to rise; but I must say, nobody should be happy that the American people are not going to have a debate on one of the most important constitutional issues facing this country. This process was very, very faulty; and I think it is unfortunate that that occurred.
