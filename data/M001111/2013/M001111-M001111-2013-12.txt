 In fact, the often-touted and quoted Simpson-Bowles Commission report even in this debate over the last day is much more egregious in what they are seeking.  Secondly, I agree with everything he said except for one thing. The Senator from Arizona mentioned that we have 1 year to look at the commission report. It is actually 2 years before this goes into effect. Congress will have time to act. The Senate Armed Services Committee will be looking at the commission report. We will have an opportunity to look at this in its entirety before it is implemented. I truly want to thank the Senator for speaking up for our military, because I know more than any one of us on this floor that when the Senator speaks for the military, he understands the consequences of not enacting legislation today.  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the chairperson for her hard work. I believe most Americans are a bit surprised that there is any agreement. I believe the chairperson would agree that this is a small step. But I think the chairperson should also deserve and be accorded great credit for tough negotiating, for a good agreement that I think will achieve many things, but, most of all, prevention of the shutdown of the government again which we should not and cannot inflict on the American people.  I am sure the chairperson would have had different provisions in it if she had written it herself, just as Congressman Ryan would say the same thing. But this is the essence of what we are supposed to be doing. The option of shutting down the government is something I do not really understand, why anybody, after what we just went through, would want to have as a viable option of our failure to act.  Again, I thank the chairperson.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from Washington.
