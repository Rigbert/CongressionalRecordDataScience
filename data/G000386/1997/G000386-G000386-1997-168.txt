 President, I am a cosponsor of the resolution that the distinguished Senator from West Virginia just spoke of. I applaud him. I associate myself with the kind remarks that the Senator from Idaho made because it is a very forceful tool, and is a very badly needed tool to make sure that our Constitution and our economy is protected.
