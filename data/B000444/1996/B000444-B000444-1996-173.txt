 President, the Senator from Utah keeps saying anything will kill this bill. That is not true. This is not ``kill this bill.'' If we send this back to conference for one or two or 12 amendments it does not kill this bill. Every major bill we had, including the crime bill, we sent back to conference with instructions--at least on three occasions. This will not kill this bill.  Some of this has not been well thought out. Much of what we left out of the bill, I am convinced, on reconsideration by our friends in the House, they would change their view. But I want to make it clear, I do not believe there is any evidence to suggest that sending this back to conference with specific instructions would kill the bill.  I am prepared, if the chairman and if Senator Leahy is, to yield back. I yield the floor.
