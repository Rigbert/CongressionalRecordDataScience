President, we remain well behind the pace set by the Senate during President Bush's first term. By the end of his first term, the Senate had confirmed 205 district and circuit nominees, had already confirmed 168 by this point in his third year, and had lowered judicial vacancies to 46. In contrast, the Senate has confirmed only 124 of President Obama's district and circuit nominees, leaving judicial vacancies at more than 80. The vacancy rate remains nearly double what it had been reduced to by this point in the Bush administration. Senate action on the 18 consensus judicial nominations pending before the Senate as it ends it session would have gone a long way to helping resolve the longstanding judicial vacancies that are delaying justice for so many Americans in our Federal courts across the country.  When the Senate returns in January, I hope that Senate Republicans will abandon these destructive practices and join with us to confirm the qualified, consensus judicial nominations they have stalled. This cycle of unnecessary delays must end.                               Exhibit 1                [From the New York Times, Dec. 14, 2011]                              Rock Bottom                         (By Linda Greenhouse)       Now that another highly qualified judicial nominee has been      left as road kill, the question is how much lower can the      confirmation process sink.       I'm referring to the defeat, by filibuster, last week of      Caitlin J. Halligan, President Obama's nominee to the United      States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.      I last wrote about Ms. Halligan back in April, at which point      her nomination had been pending for more than six months. Now      it's dead, on a nearly party-line vote, the Democratic      leadership having fallen six votes short of the 60 needed to      invoke cloture.       The only Republican to break ranks was Senator Lisa      Murkowski of Alaska, who won reelection as a write-in      candidate and so owes nothing to her Republican bosses. No      such independence was shown by the two Republican senators      from Maine, Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins, so-called      moderates whose efforts to explain their votes against      permitting Ms. Caitlin's nomination to come to a vote (a      simple majority would have approved it) were so contorted as      to be barely comprehensible. (Senator Collins mumbled      something about needing to shrink the appeals court, failing      to note that the Republicans invoked no such workload-related      compunctions when they filled not only the ninth seat, to      which Ms. Halligan was nominated, but the tenth as well.      There are now three vacancies on the 11-member court.)       Back in May, Senator Murkowski was also the only Republican      to vote to end the filibuster against Goodwin Liu, whom      President Obama had nominated to the United States Court of      Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco. (Now Justice      Liu, the former Berkeley law professor may have the last      laugh; Gov. Jerry Brown promptly named him to the California      Supreme Court.) At 41, Mr. Liu, a Rhodes scholar and former      Supreme Court law clerk, is a leading progressive legal      scholar of his generation. Although the Republicans came up      with other rationales for opposing him, including his Senate      Judiciary Committee testimony six years ago against the      Supreme Court confirmation of Samuel A. Alito Jr., the actual      reason was that they couldn't stand the thought of a young,      super smart, energetic liberal sitting on the appeals court,      in the launch position to become the first Asian-American on      the Supreme Court.       Mr. Liu is a friend of mine. I applauded his nomination and      was distressed at its fate. But since I don't believe that      judges are simply umpires who call balls and strikes, I get      the role of ideology in evaluating judicial nominees. What I      don't get is what happened to Ms.Halligan, whom I've met only      once or twice. She has no ideological markings other than      those that identify her with the mainstream of the New York      legal establishment, within which, following a clerkship with      Justice Stephen G. Breyer, she has made a spectacularly      successful career in both the public and private sectors. She      was solicitor general of New York State; head of the      appellate practice at a major law firm; and is now general      counsel to the Manhattan district attorney. She has argued      before the Supreme Court five times. Her 45th birthday was      Dec. 14.       This was not a fight over ideology. It was an effort to      keep the president from filling a seat on what is not just      another appeals court. The D.C. Circuit is not just a federal      court but a national one, with jurisdiction over federal      regulatory initiatives and habeas corpus appeals by      Guantanamo detainees. Next month, it will hear a potential      landmark case on the constitutionality of the Voting Rights      Act. Its caseload may not be huge, but its cases tend to be      dense, tough and vitally important.       When pressed on their treatment of Ms. Halligan,      Republicans typically invoke President George W. Bush's two      nominees whom the Democrats blocked from the D.C. Circuit,      Peter D. Keisler and Miguel A. Estrada, both highly qualified      and both prominent conservatives. (The classy Mr. Estrada      wrote to the Judiciary Committee in support of Ms. Halligan,      as did two dozen other members of leading law firms.)       But it seems to me that this tit-for-tat goes only so far.      President Bush succeeded in putting four decidedly      conservative nominees on the D.C. Circuit. Three remain there      today: Janice Rogers Brown, Thomas B. Griffith, and Brett M.      Kavanaugh. the fourth was John G. Roberts Jr. It was his      seat, which Chief Justice Roberts vacated on Sept. 29, 2005,      to which Ms. Halligan was nominated. True, the Republicans      didn't get everything they wanted. But they seem determined      to make sure that President Obama gets nothing.       Across the federal judiciary, confirmation has been      proceeding at a slow crawl. This week, the Judiciary      Committee held a scheduled confirmation hearing that could      have accommodated five nominees. But because Republican      senators claimed not to be finished reading the F.B.I. files      of four of the nominees, only one, Paul J. Watford, nominated      for the Ninth Circuit, was able to appear for his hearing.      Nominees who clear the committee without opposition have to      wait months for a floor vote because the Republicans won't      agree to a speedier schedule. Of 21 nominees now awaiting      floor votes, 18 had no committee opposition, but only a      handful, at most, will get a vote before the Senate recesses      for the year.       Just when news on the judicial front could not get more      discouraging, I came across something truly bizarre, a      position paper by the new front-runner among Republican      presidential candidates, Newt Gingrich. Under the title      ``Bringing the Courts Back Under the Constitution,'' Mr.      Gingrich launches a 28-page attack on ``lawless judges'' who      need to be reined in ``if we are going to retain American      freedoms and American identity.''       The document, he writes, ``serves as political notice to      the public and to the legislative and judicial branches that      a Gingrich administration will reject the theory of judicial      supremacy and will reject passivity as a response to Supreme      Court rulings that ignore executive and legislative concerns      and which seek to institute policy changes that more properly      rest with Congress.'' By rejecting passivity, Mr. Gingrich      means impeaching judges for ``unconstitutional'' rulings or,      failing to muster the two-thirds majority necessary for      impeachment, simply abolishing their positions.       Much of the document is a grab bag of long familiar right-     wing talking points (Judges who acknowledge foreign law? A      threat to ``American sovereignty!'') It is also just plain      sloppy, misspelling Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's name      throughout. But truly head-spinning is the tenuous hold that      this screed, from a onetime history professor, has on      American history.       Mr. Gingrich writes that the contemporary ``power grab by      the Supreme Court'' is a ``modern phenomenon and a dramatic      break from all previous American history.'' (Anyone remember      the court's response to the     New Deal?) Rebuking the court for substituting its will for      that of Congress is downright strange, given that it is the      Republicans who have run to the federal courts, imploring      judges to strike down the Congressionally enacted Affordable      Care Act.       Perhaps strangest of all is Mr. Gingrich's attack on Cooper      v. Aaron, the court's celebrated response to the Little Rock      school crisis of 1958. The unanimous opinion, signed      individually by all nine justices for emphasis, held that      Arkansas and all other states were bound by the court's      interpretation of the equal protection guarantee four years      earlier in Brown v. Board of Education. Cooper v. Aaron was,      as Justice Breyer writes in his recent book, ``Making Our      Democracy Work,'' essential in its time and part of the      ``hard-earned victory for the rule of law'' that the Little      Rock story became. Newt Gingrich is unmoved. Cooper v.      Aaron's assertion of the Supreme Court's authority, he      writes, was ``factually and historically false.''       Thinking back to Ms. Halligan's failed nomination, I      actually don't disagree with everything in Mr. Gingrich's      manifesto. Four words in boldface type on page 20 caught my      attention: ``Electing the right Senators.''                          ____________________
