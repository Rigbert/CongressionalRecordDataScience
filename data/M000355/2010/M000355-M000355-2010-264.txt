 President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his update on flood damage in Tennessee. The Commonwealth of Kentucky was impacted as well, not quite as severely but in a significant fashion. It was gratifying to get the report from the Senator from Tennessee about the status of the flood damage in his State.                          ____________________
