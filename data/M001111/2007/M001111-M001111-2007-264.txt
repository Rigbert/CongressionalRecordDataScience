 President, I thank all our colleagues for working with us to a point where I hope now we can start working through the amendments.  I call for regular order at this point, and I would remind all of us that I have about 12 or 13 amendments that have been offered. I know several other Senators have asked to be recognized to offer amendments. We want to work our way through all of these in a timely manner in regular order. We will be doing that this afternoon. So I ask Senators to stay close by the floor so we can move them through as quickly as possible. Hopefully, we can get time agreements on them in short order and dispose of them in whatever way is appropriate.  At this time, I call for regular order.                           Amendment No. 2468
