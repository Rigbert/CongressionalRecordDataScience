 President, I would like to speak to the point that the Senator from Alabama just raised. That point would be one of agreement. It would be to say that I have had the experience myself of having to get corrective legislation through. People would be surprised to know that a certain tax law that was in place legally for a long period of time was changed by a faceless bureaucrat, who increased the revenue and taxed somebody in a way where they hadn't been taxed before. And then we have a situation where those of us who want to correct what this faceless bureaucrat did find ourselves not only getting the bill written, finding all of the cosponsors that one needs, but also, then, when you actually get to the point of offering the amendment, you have to come up with an offset because there is supposedly a cost, not from the original legislation, but because some faceless bureaucrat is reinterpreting a tax law, which reinterpretation brings more revenue in; and then, if we want to go back to where Congress originally was, we have to dig up revenue and have an offset to correct something that Congress never intended in the first place.  So you can see that what the Senator from Alabama is trying to do is just to bring a little common sense to the Washington nonsense. I applaud him for doing it and also applaud him for not doing it on this bill. I commit myself to working with him. I would like to, at this point, ask him to see that I am added as a cosponsor to the original bill he put in, which has a number already.
