Operation Recognition is operated by the Riverside County Office of Education with assistance from the Riverside County Department of Veterans' Services. The program awards high school diplomas to veterans who missed completing high school due to military service in World War II, the Korean War, or the Vietnam War, or due to internment in WWII Japanese-American relocation camps.  A recognition ceremony will be held on November 11, 2009, for the following individuals who received their high school diplomas through Operation Recognition:  Robert Wayne Archer, Vincent O. Arellano, Linzy Ray Banks, Frank L. Bernich, Charles E. Billups, Floyd J. Birch, Camillo Razo Calderon, Arthur A. Carvalho, Leon Chagolla, James Franklin Colvin, Harry W.

Klauk, Rodney Scott Lloyd, Robert Magan, Salvador Soria Murillo, Ronald Edward Pearson, Harry Peterson, Hubert Pierce, Si Porter, Edward A. Sandoval, Harold E. Six, Sr., Garey Dale Smith, Jerry E. Tidwell, Roger Jay Williams, and Eldon Ray Wilson.  Our country owes a debt of gratitude to all the above recipients for their service and sacrifice. I salute all the above individuals and congratulate them on receiving their high school diploma.                          ____________________
