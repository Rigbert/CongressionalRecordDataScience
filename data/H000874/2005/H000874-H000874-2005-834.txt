Speaker, I often talk with great pride about the University of Maryland, both as an outstanding academic institution and as my alma mater. Today is no different. While this latest achievement revolves around the concept of games, it is not Gary Williams or Ralph Friedgen who are bringing home the hardware. Instead, it's Thomas Schelling, a University of Maryland professor and 50-year expert in the concept known as ``game theory,'' who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences last week.  The Fifth Congressional District congratulates Professor Schelling, whose contributions to economics will influence generations of policy-makers, diplomats, and strategic thinkers. Schelling is best known for his book, ``The Strategy of Conflict,'' a groundbreaking effort to deter the use of nuclear weapons. Schelling used his ``game theory'' to explain how the Cold War could effectively be prevented from turning into a nuclear holocaust. As Michael Kinsley recently noted in the Washington Post, Schelling's theory was born to deal with interdependence. ``The other side had to be confident that it could survive and retaliate if you went first,'' he said. ``Otherwise, in a crisis, it would be sorely tempted to go first.''  Fortunately, the world averted disaster in the case of the Cold War, but many modem day security threats remain. With nuclear terrorism the most glaring and preventablehomeland security challenge of our time, world leaders would be wise to consider Professor Schelling's theory wherever possible.  Professor Schelling has spent the majority of his adult life championing the most patriotic of causes: applying behavioral and economic sciences for the promotion of peace. The Nobel Academy rightly recognized his distinguished career, and the Nation should be proud of his accomplishments. As a native of Maryland and an alumnus of the place Schelling calls home, I take special pride in saluting his success.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Pages E2142-E2143]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]               RECOGNIZING THOMAS SCHELLING'S NOBEL PRIZE                                 ______                                                           HON.
