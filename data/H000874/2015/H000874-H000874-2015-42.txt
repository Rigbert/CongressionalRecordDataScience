I am sorry I don't have more time.  Madam Chairman, this is a bill about jobs. The amendment is about killing jobs, as he wants to kill the Bank, the gentleman who sponsored this amendment. That is all it is. Every one of these amendments will undermine the Export-Import Bank that got 313 votes on this floor.  The gentleman mentions five businesses. What he didn't mention is the thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of jobs that they create and maintain. That is what we are talking about: jobs for average Americans. Whether they work for large, medium, or small businesses, we are talking about jobs for Americans.  Here you are at the last minute trying to kill it. You had 2\1/2\ years to offer your amendments. You had 2\1/2\ years to bring this bill to the floor. You chose not to because the minority was going to kill this bill. I told your majority leader over and over and over again it had the majority of your party, and you refused to bring it to this floor.  Tonight is the time to say the majority rules, the 313 will rule. Reject every one of these amendments. Let's create jobs with the Export-Import Bank.  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair would remind Members that their remarks are to be directed to the Chair and not to other Members.
