President, I want to take a few moments today to acknowledge the work and leadership of Willie McCarter who has served for the past 15 years as chairman of the International Fund for Ireland, IFI.  The IFI was conceived by my old friend Tip O'Neill who secured the original funding in 1986. Willie McCarter became involved with the fund in 1989 and became chairman in 1992. Under his tenure, the fund flourished and became an integral economic tool that helped bring peace and understanding in Northern Ireland.  The investments that the IFI made in border counties provided an economic boost to communities that had no hope. In tumultuous times where communities were divided by religion, the IFI sponsored projects that not only created desperately needed jobs but employment where Catholics and Protestants worked side by side.  Marcelle and I have become close friends with Willie and his wife Mary. I know that our friendship will transcend his departure as chairman from the IFI. We look forward to visits with both of them here and in Ireland for many years to come.  The Irish Times interviewed Willie McCarter prior to his stepping down as chairman of the IFI at the end of February. I ask unanimous consent that the entire article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  [From the Irish Times, Feb. 4, 2005]             Fund Chairman Prepares To Bid a Fond Farewell       Willie McCarter, who is stepping down as chairman of the      International Fund for Ireland, tells Siobhan Creaton,      Finance Correspondent, of its many achievements.       After 15 years as a key figure at the International Fund      for Ireland (IFI), Derry-born businessman Willie McCarter is      preparing for departure.       At the end of February he will relinquish the chairman's      role to Denis Rooney. Mr. Rooney is a chartered quantity      surveyor and businessman from Northern Ireland whom the      British and Irish governments have hailed as a skilled and      able leader for the fund.       Mr. McCarter will be sad to say goodbye but says he is      proud of the IFI's contribution towards creating a more      stable community in Northern Ireland.       The fund, which has committed 768 million to 5,500 projects      in the North and border counties, was set up by the Irish and      British governments in 1986 as a vehicle to promote economic      regeneration and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the      six border counties.       The late U.S. politician T.P. `Tipp' O'Neill championed the      idea after a visit to Donegal and Derry.       ``John Hume brought him to see his grandmother's home      outside Buncrana in 1985 and later they went to Derry. That      was during the dark days of unemployment and Tipp said he      would try to do something to create jobs,'' Mr. McCarter      says.       In Washington, O'Neill's quest to raise financial aid for      the region was supported by President Reagan and resulted in      the U.S. Government pledging $50 million (EUR 38.4 million)      for this purpose.       The British and Irish governments, which had concluded the      Anglo-Irish Agreement, used the money to start the IFI in      1986.       It was a controversial vehicle and, having grown out of      this agreement, was viewed with deep suspicion by Northern      Ireland's Protestant community.       Mr. McCarter, a Protestant, recalls the fund's initial      difficulties.       ``It had very few friends. It got bound up in the political      to-ing and fro-ing around the Anglo Irish Agreement.''       In 1989, Mr. McCarter, who was chief executive of Fruit of      the Loom, the clothing manufacturer that was rapidly      expanding in Donegal and Derry, was asked to get involved.      The US clothing manufacturer had invested in Mr. McCarter's      women's underwear manufacturing plant in Buncrana in 1985 and      had agreed to invest GBP 18.5 million (EUR 26.8 million) and      to grow its workforce in Donegal and Derry to 3,500.       ``I was up to my tonsils running Fruit of the Loom,'' he      says. ``I spoke to John Holland his mentor in the US about      getting involved in the fund. He said it would be very good      for me and for the company.''       Mr. Holland ended the conversation saying: ``I am sure you      would be able to do that as well as run the company''.       In 1992, his involvement with the fund increased when he      took over as chairman.       ``The fund was a subtle way to bring people from both      communities together. Instead of giving them cups of tea and      saying `let's get reconciled', it used job creation to give      people an economic focus. In a low-key way, the fund brought      people from both communities into projects to provide a human      dynamic and develop relationships that would not have existed      in a divided society.''       Some of its flagship undertakings include the re-opening of      the Shannon-Erne waterway, while many town centres have been      given a face-lift with its support.       Mr. McCarter believes the fund's ability to be the first to      put its cash on the table to back new projects has been a      tremendous asset in terms of providing a kick-start for fresh      ideas. Its role in the Shannon-Erne waterway, he says, is a      good example of what the fund can do.       ``When it was first mentioned, it was regarded as a      completely mad project. The fund commissioned a GBP 1 million      feasibility study that showed it might work. We later put      another GBP 5 million into it and attracted other investment.      If the fund hadn't put GBP 1 million down initially, the      Shannon-Erne waterway wouldn't have happened,'' he says.       The fund claims to have played a central role in bringing      about the joint marketing of Ireland as a tourist destination      by the authorities in the North and the Republic. It has also      fostered closer linkages between Cork, Trinity and Queen's      universities in the field of microelectronics.       ``A lot of initiatives have worked but the fund's role has      been forgotten,'' according to Mr. McCarter. ``I am glad that      the fund is seen as a fair and reputable dealer. I have      worked with very gifted people on the board and in the      communities who have made a great contribution.''       While US presidents have played a crucial role in      supporting the peace process and the IFI's work, its      contribution to the fund has been reduced from $25 million to      $18.5 million under the Bush administration due to budgetary      pressures.       Mr. McCarter says this figure is ``not half bad'' and      suggests that the Bush administration has been misjudged in      terms of its commitment to Ireland.       ``President Bush may not have the same personal interest as      President Clinton but the administration has a very tangible      interest in Ireland, the peace process and the fund. Support      in the Senate and the House of Representatives remains      extremely strong. These people are made of stern stuff. They      will see things through until there is a stable society,'' he      says.       While the peace process is currently at an impasse, Mr      McCarter believes there is little danger that the enormous      strides made, in terms of improving relationships and raising      prosperity, will be reversed.       ``I don't think it will unravel. Too many people can see      the benefits. I have lived in a border area all of my life      and can see a tangible change.''       Mr McCarter was ousted from Fruit of the Loom in 1997      following differences with its then owner, US corporate      raider Bill Farley. The exit of the McCarter family from the      business was a blow for the workforce and signalled the end      of an era in terms of job security. The workforce has dropped      to around 500, with the entire operations to be moved to      Morocco over the next three to four years.       ``When it goes to Morocco, it will be after 20 years in the      north- west. It did a lot of good. Fruit of the Loom led to a      lot of people making lives for themselves and was influential      in improving the local infrastructure. I will be sorry to see      it go. I am very fond of Donegal and Derry, which now need a      substantial investment.''       In the future, Mr McCarter says his main interest will be      in Cooley Distillery, the independent whiskey maker founded      by his long-time friend, John Teeling. Mr McCarter is a      director and is also on the board of Norish. He is keen to      get involved in other businesses.       ``I already do quite a lot of work at Cooley and am looking      for more non-executive roles,'' he says. ``I would also like      to find some way of retaining the many US connections I have      made over the years.''                          ____________________[Pages S1860-S1861]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                            WILLIE McCARTER
