Madam Speaker, I am happy to introduce today the Native American Challenge Demonstration Project Act of 2007. This legislation acknowledges the special historical and legal relationship of the United States to Native American people and builds on the lessons we as a Nation have learned in the international arena and our often-failed efforts to bring jobs, income and hope to Native people here at home.  Anyone who has visited Alaska Native communities or Indian reservations in the continental U.S. knows that Native people continue to lag behind their countrymen despite a rich cultural legacy and in some instances abundant natural resources on and under their lands. Native economies face a number of hurdles including geographic remoteness, distance from markets and population centers, and lack of or poor physical infrastructure. After decades of failed Federal efforts to revitalize Native economies, I believe the time is right to use what we know is working to reduce poverty, increase incomes, and encourage transparent governments in the developing world. Initiated in 2003, the Millennium Challenge Act has put forth ration has developed a model for reducing poverty and promoting sustainable economic growth.  The bill I am introducing today would use these same principles to enhance the long-term job creation and revenue generation potential of Native economies by creating investment-favorable climates and increasing Native productivity. It would also administer Federal economic development assistance in a new way to promote economic growth, eliminate poverty, and strengthen good governance, entrepreneurship, and investment in Native communities.  The Native American Challenge rests on four key principles that are as relevant to Native communities as they are to the developing world: (1) reducing poverty through vigorous private sector economic growth is a proven method of success; (2) rewarding constructive policies that are initiated and followed by the host government is a legitimate tool of United States policy; (3) operating as true partners with eligible entities increases the chances of success by maximizing communication and identifying and pursuing whatever mid-course corrections might be needed in tailoring an eligible entity's development plan; and (4) focusing on clearly-articulated criteria and concrete results by funneling Corporation attention and resources on those countries that have clear objectives, are willing and able to measure progress, and can therefore ensure accountability in their development plan.  A critical component of the Native American Challenge is in its demand for accountability in the performance of the Compact terms and use of financial resources and this legislation would require that not later than March 15, 2008, and annually thereafter, the eligible entities shall prepare and submit to the Secretary written reports regarding the assistance provided under this Act during the previous fiscal year. These reports, with any additional information the Secretary deems relevant, will then be transmitted to Congress by May 15 of each year.  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.                          ____________________
