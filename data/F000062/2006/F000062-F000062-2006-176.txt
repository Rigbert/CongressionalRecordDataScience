 President, I am pleased to join with Senator Sessions to introduce the Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act. Our legislation protects the safety of consumers who wish to purchase prescription drugs over the Internet, while holding accountable those who operate unregistered pharmacies.  Just a few weeks ago, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee for a DOJ Oversight hearing. In discussing the Department's priorities, he singled out how ``the purchase of ... controlled pharmaceuticals on the Internet is ofgreat concern.'' He noted how the Internet's wide accessibility and anonymity ``give drug abusers the ability to circumvent the law, as well as sound medical practice, a[s] they dispense potentially dangerous controlled pharmaceuticals.'' With ``no identifying... information on these Web sites, it is very difficult for law enforcement to track any of the individuals behind them.''  I believe this bill will address many of these problems that the Attorney General has identified.  To understand how many of these Internet pharmacy Web sites exist, just visit any Internet search engine. Type in the name of any controlled substance or prescription drug. Several Web sites will appear, offering to sell you these drugs without a prescription and without a medical examination. Some of these Web sites simply ask patients to send copies of medical records, with no verification of their validity.  Patients use these pharmacies to obtain addictive drugs, like Vicodin and Oxycontin. They can receive prescription medications like Viagra without a doctor performing a physical exam to ensure that an underlying health condition will not cause a dangerous side effect.  At the same time, receiving medications from a legitimate, licensed Internet pharmacy is one of the new conveniences ushered in by the Internet age. This bill preserves the ability of well-run pharmacies and well-intentioned patients to access prescription drugs and controlled substances by means of the Internet.  This legislation imposes basic, commonsense requirements on an industry that presents both promise and peril.  First, this bill establishes disclosure standards for Internet pharmacies.  Second, this bill prohibits an Internet pharmacy from dispensing or selling a prescription drug or controlled substance without an in-person examination by a physician.  Third, it allows a State attorney general to bring a civil action in Federal district court to enjoin a pharmacy operating in violation of the law and to enforce compliance with the provisions of this law.  The disclosure requirements contained in this bill will allow patients to differentiate between shady offshore pharmacies, and legitimate licensed ones. Under this legislation, pharmacies must clearly disclose the name and address of the pharmacy, contact information for the pharmacist-in-charge, and a list of States in which the pharmacy is licensed to operate. They must also clearly post a statement that they comply with the requirements in this legislation.  The bill states pharmacies can dispense to patients only if they have a valid prescription from a practitioner who has performed an in-person examination. This requirement will ensure that doctors can verify the health status of a patient and ensure that the drug he or she will receive from the pharmacy is medically appropriate.  This legislation recognizes that in the case of an emergency, a patient may not always be able to see his or her typical physician. For that reason, it allows a doctor to designate a covering practitioner to write a valid prescription if he or she is not available.  Finally, this bill contains real penalties to hold accountable those who continue to operate pharmacies in violation of these requirements.  First, for Internet sales of prescription drugs and controlled substances, the bill makes clear that such activities are subject to the current Federal laws against illegal distributions and the same penalties applicable to hand-to-hand sales.  Second, the bill increases the penalties for illegal distributions of controlled substances categorized by the DEA as schedule III, IV and V substances, with new penalties if death or serious bodily injury results and longer periods of supervised release available after convictions.  The bill also allows a State's attorney general to file a Federal motion to stop these pharmacies from operating illegally, no matter where the entity is headquartered. Previously, this type of enforcement would require a filing in every State.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
