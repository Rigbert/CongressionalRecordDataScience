Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 376, which expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the Federal Trade Commission should investigate the publication of the video game ``Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas'' to determine whether the publisher deceived the Entertainment Software Ratings Board to avoid an ``Adults-Only'' rating.  I believe that the government should always tread lightly and carefully in taking action that evaluates the content of video games, music, movies, books and similar materials.  I also believe that parents have the primary responsibility for evaluating and monitoring the content available to their children.  However, the content industry--movie studios, television networks, record labels, book publishers, and video game developers--also has a responsibility to accurately, honestly and responsibly label and market their products.  Thus, I believe it is appropriate and necessary for the Federal Trade Commission to inquire and investigate the development and marketing process for ``Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.''  There is no question that pornographic material was embedded in this video game, and that it has been marketed to teenagers and sold in stores in every community in America. The developers and publishers of this video game owe an explanation. Were they aware that the game contained embedded scenes that would inevitably be revealed? And, did they purposely pursue a rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board of ``Mature'' rather than ``Adults Only'' to ensure that the game could be sold teenagers and thus a broader market?  This is the purpose of this investigation and this bill. Intentional deception must not go unpunished.                          ____________________
