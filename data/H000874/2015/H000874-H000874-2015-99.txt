He should not have done what he did. It was a tragedy. We all agree on that.  Very frankly, we don't think that he was compelled to do so by the sanctuary law that San Francisco had in effect.  I will tell the majority leader that we had a difference of opinion in a previous bill, the Violence Against Women Act, where you did not include protection for immigrants when they came forward to law enforcement authorities and complained of domestic violence.  We had a disagreement on that, and the disagreement was that we thought they ought to be protected, which is why so many law enforcement officials opposed the bill that was brought forward.  I will tell you again, Mr. Leader, that we do not believe that the statute that was in San Francisco compelled or led to the actions of the sheriff in releasing a felon who had committed the numerous felonies and should not have been released. It was a tragedy.  Let me go on, Mr. Leader, to the appropriations process.  There are no appropriation bills listed on your schedule for next week. We have after next week some, I think, 16 legislative days left between now and the end of the fiscal year.  Again, for the next period that we are going to be back and in light of the fact that we know what it is going to be at least--and I will have some questions on some things that may be on, but we know what is scheduled for next week--does the gentleman believe that our Members ought to anticipate the further consideration of appropriation bills prior to the end of the fiscal year?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  As I mentioned last week, yes, it is our intention to get back to the appropriation process as soon as possible.  As the gentleman knows, we are halfway done. We should finish our job, but I will make sure to keep the Members updated on the appropriation bills as they are scheduled and continue to be considered.
