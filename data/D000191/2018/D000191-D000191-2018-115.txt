Speaker, today I would like to honor Mr. Craig LaMountain for his dedication and accomplishments in establishing the Vietnam War Foundation and Museum for the purpose of memorializing those who fought in Vietnam as well as to educate succeeding generations concerning these veterans' experiences, sacrifices, service, and devotion to duty.  Mr. LaMountain is a Vietnam veteran, drafted into the U.S. Army in October 1966 and coming home in August 1968. Mr. LaMountain began collecting memorabilia and visiting schools in New York after his brother, LT Vetal Charles LaMountain, a Naval aviator crashed while on a mission during the Vietnam War and whose remains were never recovered. When Mr. LaMountain's close cousin, Mickey Addy, died of cancer from Agent Orange, the collection was expanded to further present to schools the opportunity for veterans to share their experiences. Like so many Vietnam veterans, Mr. LaMountain continues to sacrifice to this day in fighting his own battle against the effects of Agent Orange.  Upon retirement, Mr. LaMountain incorporated his collection as the Vietnam War Foundation (VWF), a non-profit 501(c)(3) public education foundation. The VWF provides schoolchildren and the general public the opportunity to learn about the military legacy of the 1960s in a ``hands-on'', free of charge environment, hear its Vietnam veterans share their stories, and see and touch restored, historic military aircraft and vehicles. No other known educational foundation in the U.S. is totally dedicated to preserving this unique Vietnam era equipment and memorabilia for future generations of schoolchildren and the general public to experience. Mr. LaMountain has devoted himself to this mission for over 30 years.  It is my privilege to honor Mr. Craig LaMountain today, and my sincere hope that you'll join me in recognizing him for his extraordinary effort to present the Vietnam era story and experiences to schools, veterans and their families, historians and the general public.                          ____________________
