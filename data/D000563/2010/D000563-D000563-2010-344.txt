President, today I recognize Alice and Edward ``Buzz'' Palmer for their service and dedication to Chicago's African-American community.  The Palmers have worked for many years in a variety of capacities to build a strong, involved, and educated African-American community in the city of Chicago.  Alice graduated from high school at the age of 16, and with the help of four jobs and a scholarship, she was able to attend Indiana University. When she graduated in 1965, she used her degree to help others. She became an educator. While she taught at Malcolm X College, Northwestern University, and the University of Illinois at Chicago, she also managed to continue her own education, earning a master's degree from Roosevelt University and a Ph.D. from Northwestern.  Alice realized that education extended outside of the classroom, and so did her work. She helped create voter education programs and founded the Metropolitan Chicago chapter of the YMCA's youth and government program. The YMCA program aims to inspire young people to civic engagement and create opportunities to interact with the political system through service learning and model government.  As a teacher, and later as a legislator, Alice firmly believed that all students could learn. She made it her job to see that each student had that opportunity. She began a drop-out intervention program in the ChicagoPublic Schools to give students the skills and encouragement to stay in school. As an Illinois State senator, she made it a priority to bring charter schools to Chicago. She knew the status quo in the public schools was not good enough, and she worked to create more opportunity for Chicago's students.  Alice has always strived to provide the African-American community with the education and tools necessary to build a better future. Alice shares that goal with her husband, Buzz.  Buzz grew up in Chicago and experienced the racism that plagued the city in the 1940s and 1950s. After serving in the Air Force as an elite intelligence officer, he returned to Chicago and joined the Chicago Police Department. There, Buzz observed firsthand the tense relationship between the police and the African-American community, and in response, he created the African American Patrolman's League. The league worked within the department and the African-American community to counteract racism and change the way the CPD was perceived and the way it behaved.  In the 1970s, Buzz focused his energy on addressing racial prejudice in the health care system. He started a community group that petitioned local hospitals to provide better quality health care for Black families and to hire more African-American medical professionals. He joined with other health-focused community groups and Chicago area medical schools to create the Chicago Area Health and Medical Careers Program. The program uses structured academics, counseling, motivational and financial support to help underrepresented minorities pursue degrees in medicine.  Over the years, Buzz expanded his view and took a keen interest in better connecting African Americans with the international community. Together Alice and Buzz Palmer founded the Black Press Institute to compile and edit news from Black media outlets throughout the United States for distribution worldwide.  On October 2 of this year, Alice and Buzz Palmer are being honored with lifetime achievement awards from the United Black Fund of Illinois for their decades of work with the African-American community in Chicago. I congratulate them on this award and thank them for their lifetime of dedication to Chicago and the African American community.                          ____________________
