 Mr. McCARTHY. I would ask the gentleman to join with me, then, in requesting that the Democrats on the Senate--the filibuster denies the bill to even come up for debate, let alone it be voted for. So would you not join with me in asking the Democrats to stop playing politics with a filibuster and allow the bill to come up? If the bill fails, the bill fails. But it is not even being allowed to be debated.  You were always so good with reading articles, and I don't know that I have ever read one to you, but I would like to. If you will indulge me. PolitiFact--this is the organization that looks at what we say and tries to put truth to it. This is the headline: ``Democrats Stretch Impact of Planned Parenthood Exclusions in Zika Bill.''  This is one highlighted:  ``The bill also provided funds that would potentially help clinics and hospitals in nearly every municipality on the island.''  Could we not agree that that is more important than politics? Could we not agree that people are being affected every day and that those who are watching this debate shake their head and wonder why we are even having this fight?  In June, we passed a bill. Since that time, Democrats in the Senate will not even allow it to be debated, not even allow it to be debated, to vote it up or vote it down.  There is one thing Americans believe in: fairness. And I don't believe that that is fairness, if you deny a bill from coming forward. If you deny the bill from coming forward, you are blocking it.  So, if you want the true definition of what is happening in the Zika battle, it is that those on the other side of the aisle in the Senate are blocking the discussion from even taking place.
