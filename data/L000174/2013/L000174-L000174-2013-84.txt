President, I will be speaking later this afternoon with regard to the judges, but I have heard a number of people, including the distinguished senior Senator from Connecticut and others on the floor, speaking about the effect of the shutdown. I appreciate my colleagues who come and give real-world statements of how what is happening here impacts their constituents.  I was just in Vermont and had the opportunity to talk with people, many of whom I have known for years, about how they are being effected by the shutdown.
