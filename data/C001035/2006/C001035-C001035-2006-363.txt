President, I rise today to correct the record regarding conservation funding I secured last year under the Forest Legacy Program.  During debate on the fiscal year 2006 Interior Appropriations Act, I worked with Senator Olympia Snowe to obtain $4.5 million to protect 37,000 acres of forested land in my home state of Maine. I was very pleased that these crucial resources were allocated for this section of the 100-mile wilderness, which in addition to its natural beauty provides critical habitat to a variety of species, providing vital breeding, feeding, and resting grounds.  The site of a long-deserted factory, Katahdin Ironworks, marks the gateway to this treasured expanse of wooded land. It was from this notable Piscataquis County landmark that project supporters generated the name ``Katahdin Ironworks Forest Legacy Program'' to refer to this effort to protect and preserve this stretch of forest. As the old adage goes, so much is in a name. And this name has sparked unfounded criticism from colleagues and outside interest groups who have jumped to the assumption that funding secured for this project was to be utilized for the upkeep of an abandoned building. Today, I wish to set the record straight and assure my fellow Senators and other interested parties that this highly competitive program funding will be used to ensure the survival of thousands of acres of precious forest.  There are many things that make America great, but it is our commitment to safeguarding our open spaces and wooded lands that make us unique as an industrialized Nation. Sadly, the growing trend of urban sprawl, along with the increased pressure to exploit our natural resources, has placed the survival of these invaluable lands in jeopardy. General agreement that we must undertake conservation efforts to ensure the preservation of these precious natural landscapes for future generations has lead to the development of conservation programs like Forest Legacy. This initiative has afforded us a needed mechanism to facilitate the survival of these lands. Supported by the Wilderness Society, the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, and other respected environmental protection groups, the Forest Legacy Program enjoys a wide range of support among organizations committed to natural preservation causes.  Sadly, limited resources preclude our ability to defend all endangered wilderness areas through this program, and it thus remains appropriately competitive. For this reason, I was extremelypleased that both the President's budget and the Senate Appropriations Committee recognized the importance of maintaining this pristine wilderness in my home state, and included funding to protect it through tight Forest Legacy Program dollars. In fact, this project was recognized as one of the most meritorious in the country by a distinguished panel of experts at the United States Forest Service.  I am hopeful that through increased understanding of the Forest Legacy Program and a more accurate depiction of the Katahdin Ironworks project that my colleagues will appropriately recognize and appreciate my commitment to preserving our wooded lands.                          ____________________
