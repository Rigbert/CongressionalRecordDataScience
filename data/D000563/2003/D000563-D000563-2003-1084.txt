President, I rise today to pay tribute to Christopher J. Canning, who died June 30, 2001, at the young age of 15.  Chris was from Maroa, IL, and excelled as an athlete in sports such as football, basketball, and baseball. Chris also excelled in the martial arts, where he was a multi-state and national champion, an ``AAU All American,'' and a member of the U.S. Elite team at the Olympic training center. Chris and his legacy as a martial artist will live on through the United States National AAU Taekwondo Chris Canning Award of Excellence, established in July 2002. This award is given to one athlete out of 14,000 at the U.S. National Championships.  Chris was also an honor student who appreciated reading, math and music. Chris enjoyed playing classical piano, and also played the drums for his school. Chris liked to read books outside of what was required for school. He liked to be challenged in many different subject areas.  Chris was drawn toward community and public service. Chris was also known to protect kids at school from the local bullies. He helped people less fortunate than himself by shoveling snow for the elderly without pay, collecting food and clothing for the homeless in Decatur on his own, and helping to deliver meals on wheels for those confined to home. He would always find ways to help others, and to find homes for abandoned animals through working at his grandparents' animal shelter. Looking to the future, he aspired to be in our Nation's Special Forces or to serve in the FBI.  I also want to give special recognition to Chris's family who are still mourning his tragic loss. His father and mother, Art and Melissa Canning, his brother and sister, Robert and Elizabeth, and finally his grandparents Marla and Joe Powers.  In short, Christopher J. Canning was a caring young man, a good citizen, an asset in his academic environment, and a nationally acclaimed athlete. Tragically, Chris's life was cut short.  The memory of Chris Canning lives on, and today I pay tribute to a young man who had so much promise as an athlete, student, martial artist, community servant, and son. His example will always be an inspiration to those who follow in his footsteps.                          ____________________
