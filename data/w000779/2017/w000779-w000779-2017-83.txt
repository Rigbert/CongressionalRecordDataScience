President, I would just like to set the record straight on a couple of points. I have a response to my colleagues who continually say this corporate tax cut is going to raise workers' wages by $4,000.  Now, I asked the head of the Joint Committee on Taxation whether that was the case. He essentially said, no, he did not believe it was the case and referred us to tables that document it.  Perhaps even more egregious is tonight we heard our colleague from Ohio say that a Congressional Budget Office report claims that workers are going to get 70 percent of the benefits from a corporate tax cut so it was raised even higher.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a portion of the report from the Congressional Budget Office, making it clear on the cover where it says the analysis and conclusions expressed there should not be interpreted as those of the Congressional Budget Office. It directly contradicts the comments made by the Senator from Ohio on wages and corporate tax cuts.
