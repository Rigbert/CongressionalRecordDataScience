I want to thank the gentlelady for yielding.  I rise today to honor the memory of our beloved colleague, the distinguished gentleman from the State of New Jersey, Donald Payne.  Today we have lost a wonderful and good friend, and the people of the 10th District of New Jersey have lost a fearless leader and advocate.  Any American can be elected to public office, but not everyone can serve with dignity and great respect. Donald Payne, my friend, my brother, enjoyed the admiration of his colleagues because he led by example, and through quiet, determined diplomacy he accomplished a great deal.  A deep sensitivity to the human condition was at the center of all he did. His work was an extension of the belief that each of us has a responsibility to serve one another, and that we must use the power and resources of a great Nation to relieve the burdens of the poor, the oppressed, the hungry, and the sick. That is why this former public school teacher wanted to unlock the power of education to free those who are struggling in the urban centers in America. And that is why he was a tireless advocate for the people of Africa because a heartfelt compassion guided all that he did.  In a time when the needs of the poor are hardly spoken, when the cries of the locked out and left behind are rarely heard, the Chamber will deeply miss a gentle statesman with a heart that was big enough to serve all humankind.  The thoughts and prayers of the people of the Fifth District of Georgia and many Members of this Congress are with his family, staff, and friends now as they move through a difficult time. Just know that Donald Payne was loved, and he will be deeply missed, not only by the people of the 10th District of New Jersey, but by people around this Nation and all around the world.                              {time}  1650
