President, yesterday the Senate Homeland Security Committee heard testimony from the three top U.S. intelligence officials about the errors that the Federal Government made leading up to the thwarted Christmas Day plot. We dodged a bullet that day when Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a Nigerian-born terrorist, failed to detonate a bomb on flight 253 in the skies above Detroit.  But today, Mr. President, I rise to discuss an error that was made after that foreign terrorist had already been detained by American authorities in Detroit, an error that may well have prevented the collection of valuable intelligence about future terrorist threats to our country. The error became clear during my questioning of three of our Nation's top intelligence officials at the committee's hearing yesterday. Frankly, Mr. President, I was stunned to learn that the decision to place the captured terrorist into the U.S. civilian criminal court system had been made without any input or the knowledge of the Director of National Intelligence, the Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, or the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. That is right, Mr. President, these officials were never consulted by the Department of Justice before the decision was made.  That decision was critical. The determination to charge Abdulmutallab in civilian court likely foreclosed the collection of additional intelligence information. We know that the interrogation of terrorists can provide critical intelligence, but our civil justice system, as opposed to the military detention and tribunal system established by Congress and the President, encourages terrorists to lawyer up and to stop answering questions. Indeed, that was exactly what happened in the case of Abdulmutallab. He had provided some valuable information to law enforcement officials in the hours immediately after his capture, and we surely would have obtained more information if we had treated this foreign terrorist as an enemy belligerent and had placed him in the military tribunal system. Instead, once he was read his Miranda rights, given a lawyer at our expense, he was advised to cease answering questions, and that is exactly what he did.  That poor decisionmaking may well have prevented us from finding out more of Yemen's role in training terrorists and more about future plots that are underway in Yemen targeting American citizens in this country or abroad. Good intelligence is clearly critical to our ability to stop terrorist plots before they are executed. We know that lawful interrogations of terrorist suspects can provide important intelligence. To charge Abdulmutallab in the civilian criminal system without even consulting three of our Nation's top intelligence officials simply defies common sense.  To correct this failure and to ensure that our Nation's senior intelligence officials are consulted before making the decision to try future foreign terrorists in civilian court, I am today introducing a bill that would require this crucial consultation. I am very pleased to be joined by the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Senator Lieberman, who has been such a leader in this entire area, as well as by three other Senators, Senator Bob Bennett, Senator John Ensign and Senator Kit Bond, who are also concerned about the testimony yesterday.  Specifically, our bill would require the Attorney General to consult with the Director of National Intelligence, the Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Secretary of Defense before initiating a custodial interrogation of foreign terrorists or filing civilian criminal charges against them. These officials, Mr. President, are in the best position to know what other threats the United States is facing from terrorists and to assess the need to gather more intelligence on those threats.  If there is a disagreement between the Attorney General and these intelligence officials regarding the appropriate approach to the detention and interrogation of foreign terrorists, then the bill would require the President to resolve the disagreement. Only the President would be permitted to direct the initiation of civilian law enforcement actions--balancing his constitutional responsibilities as Commander in Chief and as the Nation's chief law enforcement officer.  To be clear, this legislation would not deprive the President of any investigative or prosecutorial tool. It would not preclude a decision to charge a foreign terrorist in our military tribunal system or in our civilian criminal justice system. It would simply require that the Attorney General coordinate and consult with our top intelligence officials before making a decision that could foreclose the collection of critical additional intelligence information.  This consultation requirement is not unprecedented. Section 811 of the Counterintelligence and Security and Enhancements Act of 1994 requires the Director of the FBI and the head of a department or agency with a potential spy in its ranks to consult and periodically reassess any decision to leave the suspected spy in place so that additional intelligence can be gathered on his activities.  As the Senate Intelligence Committee noted in its report on the legislation that added the espionage consultation requirement:       While prosecutorial discretion ultimately rests with the      Department of Justice officials, it stands to reason that in      cases designed to protect our national security--such     as espionage and terrorism cases--prosecutors should ensure      that they do not make decisions that, in fact, end up harming      the national security.  The committee got it right. The committee went on to explain:       [T]he determination of whether to leave a subject in place      should be retained by the host agency.  The history of the espionage consultation requirement is eerily reminiscent of the lack of consultation that occurred in the case of Abdulmutallab. In espionage cases, Congress has already recognized that when valuable intelligence is at stake, our national security should trump decisions based solely on prosecutorial equities. This requirement must be extended to the most significant threat facing our Nation, and that is the threat of terrorism.  I encourage the Senate to act quickly on this important legislation. The changes proposed are modest. They make common sense. But the consequences could be a matter of life and death.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2943       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(c) Annual Report.--The Attorney General shall report      annually to appropriate committees of jurisdiction regarding      the number of occasions on which direction was sought from      the President under subsection (b)(2) and the number of      times, on those occasions, that the President directed      actions identified in section (a) against such foreign      person.
