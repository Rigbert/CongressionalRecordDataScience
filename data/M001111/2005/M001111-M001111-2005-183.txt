 President, we are in agreement on this amendment. It simply will clarify for the purposes of distributing funding from Section 8 housing assistance. Public housing authorities would not be penalized for shelving vouchers temporarily to develop a longer term project. This is a fairness issue, and we are all in agreement. I urge its passage.
