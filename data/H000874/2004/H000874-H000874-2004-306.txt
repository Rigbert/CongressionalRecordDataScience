Speaker, the gentleman has listed the alternative minimum tax as a schedule for the floor. I want to ask him the question I asked him about today's bill. Will that go through the Committee on Ways and Means process or is it the expectation that it will come directly to the floor without consideration by the Committee on Ways and Means?  Mr. DeLAY. I think we will probably proceed the same as we did on the bill today that just passed. The AMT bill has passed this House before. It has been marked up by the Committee on Ways and Means before. I do not know how many times. The Committee on Ways and Means feels that there is nothing new here and that the House should consider it as soon as possible, and that is why they want to bring it here, straight to the floor through the Committee on Rules. I would assume that is what the process will be.
