 President, as the 105th Congress draws to a close, I rise to express my disappointment over something we did not do. The Senate, despite strong support from both sides of the aisle, has not brought the nomination of James C. Hormel to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg to the floor, has not had a debate on the nomination, and has not had a vote on it.  This failure is really quite incomprehensible.  The President nominated James Hormel for this post on October 6, 1997. After a thorough review by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the committee approved the nomination by a vote of 16-2 and reported it to the full Senate with the recommendation that it be confirmed. And yet here it is, October 14, 1998, in the final hours of this Congress, and the nomination has not budged from the Executive Calendar.  Mr. Hormel is eminently qualified for the job of U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg. He has had a diverse and distinguished career as a lawyer, businessman, educator, and philanthropist, and he gained diplomatic experience as a member of the U.S. delegation to the 51st U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva in 1995 and as a member of the U.S. delegation to the 51st U.N. General Assembly in 1997. He was even confirmed unanimously by this very Senate for the latter post on May 23, 1997.  He has been an upstanding civic leader in San Francisco, and he has been honored for his work by organizations too numerous to mention. He is a man who is kind to all he meets, generous beyond measure, and deeply committed to making the world and his community a better place to live for all people. He is a devoted father of five grown children, and grandfather of 13. Anyone who knows him, as I have been privileged to do for over two decades, knows that he is a man of decency and honor, and the type of person who should be encouraged to be in public service.  So this is the situation we face: we have a nominee with outstanding talents and credentials; he was previously confirmed by this Senate for another post; he was approved by the Foreign Relations Committee by a 16-2 vote nearly a year ago; and over 60 Senators support bringing his nomination to a vote. And yet, we have never had the opportunity to vote on it.  Why? Because several Senators on the other side of the aisle have placed holds on the nomination, preventing a debate and a vote they knew they would lose. And the Majority Leader has refused to call up the nomination, effectively allowing the passage of time to kill it.  Why has Mr. Hormel been denied the Constitutionally delineated due process of a Senate debate and vote? The answer is simple: Mr. Hormel is gay. With no other reasonable grounds to block this nomination, one can come to no other conclusion than that some Senators are simply opposed to a gay man serving our country as a U.S. Ambassador. I believe the Senate does not want to allow this type of discrimination to prevail, and I think the vast majority of my colleagues agree. But so far, it appears that discrimination has prevailed.  I believe the majority of Americans agree with this position as well. To cite just one measure, newspaper editorials have appeared in support of Mr. Hormel's nomination across the country, including in the: Albany Times Union, Albuquerque Journal, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Atlanta Journal & Constitution, Boston Globe, Charleston (W.Va.) Gazette, Chicago Tribune, Cincinnati Post, Cleveland Plain Dealer, Detroit Free Press, Evansville Courier, Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Hartford Courant, Houston Chronicle, Los Angeles Times, Louisville (Ky.) Courier-Journal, Minneapolis-St. Paul Star-Tribune, Newark (N.J.) Star-Ledger, New Orleans Times Picayune, New York Daily News, New York Times, Peoria Journal-Star, Philadelphia Inquirer, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Portland Press Herald, Providence Journal, Riverside (Ca.) Press-Enterprise, Rocky Mountain News, San Diego Union-Tribune, San Francisco Chronicle, San Francisco Examiner, Santa Rosa (Ca.) Press Democrat, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Springfield (Ill.) Journal-Register, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, St. Petersburg Times, Syracuse Post-Standard, Tulsa World, Washington Post, and York (Pa.) Daily Record.  Many of these newspapers have also run op-ed columns which call for a vote on the nomination, as have the: Arizona Republic, Buffalo News, Columbus Dispatch, Dallas Morning News, Denver Post, Des Moines Register, Detroit News, Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel, Greensboro News & Record, Madison Capital Times, Memphis Commercial Appeal, Northern New Jersey Record, Raleigh News & Observer, Salt Lake City Tribune, and USA Today.  I deeply regret that the Senate has not been permitted to have its say on this eminently qualified nominee solely because he is gay. But the Senate's failure to act need not prevent Mr. Hormel from assuming his post. In a case such as this, where the Senate has so clearly failed to fulfill its Constitutional obligation with respect to a nomination, even though a clear majority of the Senate supports that nomination, I believe it is entirely appropriate for the President to use his Constitutional authority to make a recess appointment.  Luxembourg is a NATO ally, and we need an ambassador there. Mr. Hormel has every qualification necessary to be an outstanding ambassador, and he would have been overwhelmingly confirmed if the Senate had been allowed to vote. But we were not. I, therefore, urge President Clinton, after Congress adjourns, to make a recess appointment of James Hormel to be U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg. It is the right thing to do, and it will give the country the benefit of the service of James Hormel, which the Senate has failed to do.  Mr. President, because the Senate has not had the opportunity to debate this nomination, I ask unanimous consent to place in the Record some of the materials I would have used in the course of that debate, including some of the notable editorials, op-ed pieces, and letters of support that have come to my attention.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Los Angeles Times, July 22, 1998]                       Game's Not Over for Hormel       Even though this hasn't been a notably busy or productive      year for the U.S. Senate, Majority Leader Trent Lott has      decided that there simply is no time available to vote on the      nomination of James Hormel as ambassador to Luxembourg. Never      mind that Hormel's confirmation has been pending since last      fall, that hearings on his fitness have long since been      completed or that Lott early on declared his unshakable      belief that Hormel should not represent his country abroad      because he is a homosexual. The excuse du jour is that the      Senate calendar is     too crowded to permit a confirmation vote. So Lott and a      handful of others of like mind will have denied the Senate      its constitutional responsibility to advise and consent to      this nomination.       That's not the end of the story, however. The Constitution      also empowers the president to fill vacancies when Congress      is in recess. Congress is rushing toward recess now, its      members eager to campaign for the November elections. Once it      has adjourned, President Clinton can name Hormel to the      Luxembourg post. He is qualified, he is acceptable to the      host government and his sexual orientation is utterly      irrelevant.       That's the way most senators feel, as Lott well knows. Had      the Senate leader allowed a floor vote, Hormel would easily      have been confirmed. Instead Lott used his powers to prevent      a vote, meanwhile taking to the airwaves to give his opinion      that homosexuality is a treatable condition, as he put it,      like alcoholism or kleptomania. In other words, anyone who      makes the effort can surmount it. That notion may play well      in some circles. It hardly elevates the reputation of the      Senate.       In a few weeks the Senate will recess. There's no reason      why Hormel shouldn't be presenting his credentials in      Luxembourg not long after.                                  ____             [From the Atlanta Constitution, July 2, 1998]                   Senate Discriminates Against Gays       When gay Americans have sought protection against being      fired from jobs or being denied employment solely because of      their sexual orientation, they have been slapped with the      charge that they are seeking ``special rights.''       The implication of the term, ``special rights,'' has been      that gay Americans don't really need job protection, that      they seek some sort of exalted legal status above and beyond      that enjoyed by other Americans. That doesn't make much sense      to gay Americans, for whom job discrimination is very real,      but it has nonetheless become the standard line for      politicians in rejecting gay-rights legislation.       The example of businessman James Hormel has exposed the      hypocrisy of that argument. President Clinton has nominated      Hormel to be U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg, a largely      honorary role that requires confirmation by the U.S. Senate.      But a vote on Hormel's nomination has been blocked by a small      minority of U.S. senators for one very obvious and silly      reason: He is gay, and they don't like gay people.       It's a situation rich in irony. Most of those opposing      Hormel have no doubt cited the ``special rights'' argument in      the past, denying that gay Americans need protection. Now      here they are, in a very public setting, committing a form of      discrimination that supposedly does not exist.       For that reason, the Hormel nomination already has served a      great public benefit. It has stripped away the code phrases      and the weasel words that certain politicians have used to      communicate their message of hate to one crowd while      maintaining the pretense of tolerance for others. It has      ripped away the mask exposing the hate that has always hidden      behind that term ``special rights.''       Here is a good man, a person of great accomplishment and      civic contributions, denied the chance to represent his      country simply because he is gay. And the wellspring of that      bias and hate, the agency denying him a job because of his      sexual orientation, is the U.S. Senate.       That is shameful.       No American should be denied the opportunity to contribute      to his country, or more fundamentally, to simply earn a      living, because of his sexual nature. If the right to earn a      living and contribute to one's country is a ``special      right,'' it is a special right that must be available to all      Americans.                                  ____            [From the Philadelphia Inquirer, June 23, 1998]                          Hold That Homophobia       Maybe Don Nickles, the second-ranking Republican in the      Senate, thinks he's Don Rickles, the insult-comedian? That      might explain his screed Sunday against a gay businessman      nominated to be an ambassador.       Alas, Mr. Nickles and other die-hard opponents of sending      James Hormel to Luxembourg are slinging their insults in dead      earnest.       They say it's not simply that this would-be diplomat is      gay; it's that he's out of the closet. Mr. Hormel, a wealthy      San Franciscan, has given tons of money to various causes and      institutions, including Swarthmore College. But his foes      fulminate about his donations to ``a gay and lesbian center''      at San Francisco's main library.       ``One might have that lifestyle,'' said Mr. Nickles, ``but      if one promotes it as acceptable behavior . . . I don't think      they [sic] should be representative of this country.''       Never mind that Mr. Hormel's public service includes stints      at the U.N. Human Rights Commission and General Assembly.       Never mind that his nomination has been endorsed by      Republicans such as former Secretary of State George Shulz      and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch.       Never mind that his defenders, including the executive      director of the American Library Association, argue that      libraries ought to include a breadth of materials.       For months now, his nomination has been in limbo because a      few senators invoke their informal power to put an indefinite      ``hold'' on it. If homophobes want to oppose Mr. Hormel, even      though Luxembourg has expressed its approval, let 'em. But      his future should be decided by the full Senate, not X'd out      by a tiny minority.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, June 22, 1998]                      Let Them Vote on Mr. Hormel       James Hormel, President Clinton's nominee to be ambassador      to Luxembourg, is opposed by a small group of Republican      senators who are looking smaller all the time. It is not Mr.      Hormel's credentials that are in question. An heir to the      Hormel Meat-packing fortune, a former dean of the University      of Chicago Law School, he has given leadership and money to      causes that range from the San Francisco Symphony to      Swarthmore College and the Human Rights Campaign, the main      political lobby for homosexual rights.       Mr. Hormel is gay, but that is not an issue in Luxembourg.      As Alphonse Berns, Luxembourg's Ambassador to the United      States, said on Friday, ``We would welcome Mr. Hormel.'' But      for months, Senators James Inhofe of Oklahoma, Tim Hutchinson      of Arkansas and Robert Smith of New Hampshire have been      blocking a vote on the nomination, making dark suggestions      about Mr. Hormel's gay-rights ``agenda,'' as if he might      somehow seek to lead the moral standards of Luxembourg array.       Discrimination against people on the basis of their sexual      orientation is outlawed in Luxembourg and in all the other      countries in the European Union. It is illegal in San      Francisco, where Mr. Hormel lives, and in Washington--except      in such place as Congress, where the Republican leadership      has made a fetish of it lately.       Last week, Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, who has      refused to bring the Hormel nomination up for a vote, said in      a television interview that he thought homosexuality was a      sin. He likened it to alcoholism, kleptornania and ``sex      addiction.'' The next day, Dick Armey, the House majority      leader, said he thought it was a sin too, and cited some      Bible scripture to the effect that neither fornicators, nor      adulterers, ``nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with      mankind'' shall inherit the kingdom of God.       Finally, in a letter to Mr. Lott made public on Thursday,      Senator Alfonse D'Amato of new York broke the silence of his      fellow Republicans to say that it was wrong to block Hormel's      nomination simply because he is gay. ``I am embarrassed,'' he      said. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California has said she      believes more than 60 senators support Mr. Hormel. Mr. Lott      should let the nomination go to the floor, so Mr. Hormel. can      be judged on his merit.                                  ____                [From the Washington Post, May 12, 1998]                           Qualified To Serve       Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, refuses to let the      Senate vote on President Clinton's nominee to be ambassador      to Luxembourg. Four of Mr. Lott's fellow Republicans have      objected to would-be ambassador James Hormel because, they      say, of his support for gay rights. But many other Clinton      appointees have shared Mr. Hormel's views on that matter. The      real problem seems to be that Mr. Hormel is himself openly      gay.       Mr. Hormel, 65, is a longtime supporter of the Democratic      Party, and you could certainly make a case that more career      diplomats and fewer political contributors should get      ambassadorial posts. But as political nominations go, Mr.      Hormel is, according to wide bipartisan consensus, unusually      well qualified. A lawyer and businessman from San Francisco,      Mr. Hormel has been a longtime and effective supporter of      many charitable causes. George Shultz, former secretary of      state, says Mr. Hormel ``would be a wonderful representative      for our country.''       The senators who object--Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas, James      Inhofe of Oklahoma, Robert Smith of New Hampshire and a      fourth who remains anonymous--say they fear he would use his      ambassadorship to advance a gay rights agenda. How that might      come about in Luxembourg is hard to see; in any case, Mr.      Hormel has made clear that he would use his post to promote      U.S. policy, and U.S. policy only.       Mr. Hormel's nomination sailed through the Senate Foreign      Relations Committee last fall. Now he deserves a vote in the      full Senate. Those senators who don't believe a gay person      should represent the United States overseas would be able to      vote no. Those who believe the United States should welcome      to public service its most qualified citizens regardless of      race, religion, gender, ethnic background or sexual      orientation, would be able to vote yes. We believe a majority      of the Senate inclines toward the latter view. As Republican      Sen. Orrin Hatch said in support of Mr. Hormel's nomination,      ``I just don't believe in prejudice against any individual,      regardless.''                                  ____                  [From the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]         Strange Diplomacy--Senator Hutchinson, Meet Mr. Hormel       Any day now Tim Hutchinson is to meet with James Hormel.      Mr. Hutchinson, you may have noticed, is the junior senator      from Arkansas, and Mr. Hormel is the ambassador-designate to      Luxembourg whose appointment Senator Hutchinson has been      holding up.       We thought better of Tim Hutchinson. It's one thing to      block an ambassadorial nomination when policy is the issue.      That's what Jesse Helms did when William Weld, then governor      of Massachusetts, was nominated     as ambassador to Mexico. The irrepressible senator from North      Carolina reasoned that the drug trade was going to be a major      issue between the United States and Mexico, and that made Mr.      Weld's position on legalizing marijuana fair game.       But now Senator Hutchinson has put ahold on the nomination      of James Hormel--scion of the Spam-making family--as      ambassador to Luxembourg. The senator says he's concerned      about the ``activism'' of Mr. Hormel in pushing rights for      homosexuals.       Funny, we don't remember homosexuality being a major issue      between the United States and Luxembourg. Nor does Luxembourg      seem to offer much of a platform for espousing any political      agenda. Luxembourg is by all accounts a lovely country about      the size of Rhode Island, and one not likely to be confused      with a great power.       Tim Hutchinson says he plans to find out more for himself      about the nominee's background. When he does he'll learn that      James Hormel has many qualifications as representative of      this country.                           *   *   *   *   *       Not only all that, but James Hormel already has a      diplomatic background of sorts: He was a delegate to the      United Nations Human Rights Commission's meeting in Geneva in      1995, and he was an alternate in this country's delegation to      the UN General Assembly this year.       That last position required confirmation by the Senate. Mr.      Hormel's ``activism'' wasn't an issue for Senator Hutchinson      when that vote came up.       When it comes down to it and ambassadorship to a small      friendly country requires little more than an ability to      throw good parties. What's our junior senator worried about--     that James Hormel will serve Spam at diplomatic receptions?      That he'll re-decorate the ambassador's residence in      lavender? Come On, senator. Wake up and grow up.       Senators have more realistic problems to worry about. Or      should have Senator Hutchinson's objections to Mr. Hormel are      enough to make that clunky, over-worked word Homophobis all      too relevant.       Orrin Hatch, the senator from Utah, said it plain when he      urged his colleagues to lift Tim Hutchinson's embarrassing      hold on this nomination. ``We ought to vote on him,'' Senator      Hatch said of the nominee, ``and I personally believe he      would pass and he'd become the next ambassador to Luxembourg.      I just don't believe in prejudice against any individual and,      frankly, we have far too much of that.'' to quote Orrin      Hatch. ``I get tired of that kind of stuff.'' So do we.                                  ____                [From the Washington Post, July 7, 1998]                           A Vote for Hormel                         (By James K. Glassman)       Luxembourg is a nation of 400,000 souls in the middle of      Europe. It's smaller than Jacksonville, Fla., but it's the      focus of a big controversy in Washington. Back in October,      President Clinton picked James C. Hormel of San Francisco, an      investor and philanthropist, to be U.S. ambassador to      Luxembourg. The next month, he was approved by the Senate      Foreign Relations Committee, 16-2. But it is unlikely that      the ``Spam heir,'' as the local newspapers call him, will      ever become our envoy to the Grand Duchy.       Trent Lott, the Senate Majority Leader, refuses to put the      matter to a vote. Hormel is gay, and Lott considers      homosexuality a sin. In an interview on ``The Armstrong      Williams Show,'' Lott elaborated: ``You should still love      that person. You should not try to mistreat them or treat      them as outcasts. You should try to show them a way to deal      with that problem, just like alcohol . . . or sex addiction .      . . or kleptomaniacs.''       Kleptomaniacs! The Hormel nomination has brought anti-gay      sentiment among GOP leaders out of the closet--and it is an      ugly sight. Recent comments by Lott, Foreign Relations      Chairman Jesse Helms (``it's sickening'') and Senate Whip Don      Nickles (``immoral behavior'') may appear unenlightened and      ignorant, but politicians, like the rest of us, are entitled      to their bigotries.       Through their actions as lawmakers, however, politicians      should not be entitled to impose such bigotries--or religious      or moral convictions, if you prefer--about matters of      personal behavior on the rest of us.       In general, while Americans don't approve of homosexuality,      they are very tolerant of it--and getting more so. For      example, 52 percent of respondents to a Gallup poll last year      said homosexuality was ``not an acceptable alternative      lifestyle''--a figure essentially unchanged from 1982. But 84      percent (up from 59 percent 16 years ago) said homosexuals      ``should have equal rights in terms of job opportunities.''      Gallup says that ``solid majorities'' favor gays as      elementary school teachers (up from 27 percent in 1977) and      clergy (up from 36 percent).       What's truly disturbing about the Hormel affair is that it      shows how conservatives, who claim to favor a smaller, less      intrusive government, can't resist using it to impose their      own moral views on the public.       Frederich von Hayek, the Nobel Prize-winning economist and      a patron saint to many conservatives, identified this      propensity in a famous essay in 1960. ``In general,'' he      wrote, ``it can probably be said that the conservative does      not object to coercion or arbitrary power so long as it is      used for what he regards as right purposes. . . . Like the      socialist, he regards himself as entitled to force the values      he holds on other people.''       At a conference on homosexuality at Georgetown University,      Bill Kristol, a conservative intellectual leader and editor      of the Weekly Standard, complained about ``a denial of the      public's right to uphold moral standards.'' But he, too,      misses the key distinction: No one is denying the right of      individuals and groups to campaign against immorality as they      see it. But public officials, in the discharge of their      duties are something else. Judgments about truly personal      behavior are not their province.       Some of Hormel's foes claim they are against him not      because he's gay but because he's a vigorous proselytizer for      gay causes. ``He has promoted that lifestyle and promoted it      in a big way, in a way that is very offensive,'' said      Nickles.       But this is a meaningless distinction. Gays are denied jobs      because of their sexual orientation. Why shouldn't Hormel      campaign to change that situation? Lott and Nickles sound      like a couple of 1950s southern segregationists: ``It's not      that we're against nigras. It's that we're against them      marching for their so-called rights.''       One reason the American system works so well is that, in      Hayek's words, ``we agree to tolerate much that we dislike.''      It's that agreement ``that makes it possible to build a      peaceful society with a minimum of force.''       When we abandon tolerance, the trouble begins. It's bad      enough on college campuses, where rules against ``offensive      speech'' are used to stifle ideas unpopular to the left and,      of course, to hypersensitive gays. But when it comes to      government, which wields the power to tax and imprison,      tolerance is an absolute necessity.       As far as our international relations are concerned, it      makes no difference at all whether Hormel becomes an      ambassador. As far as the preservation of our freedoms and      proper role of our government are concerned, it makes a big      difference indeed.                                  ____                              San Francisco, CA, February 6, 1998.

He gives time and personal effort as well as      resources to improve the quality of life in our community.       We recommend him to you because we believe he would be a      wonderful representative for our country.

Text of Senator D'Amato's      letter follows:       Dear Majority Leader: I urge you to permit an up or down      vote on the nomination of Mr. James Hormel to serve as United      States Ambassador to Luxembourg. I support proceeding to a      vote for three basic reasons.       First, Mr. Hormel is a highly qualified nominee. His      academic, business, and community service credentials are      outstanding and are easily equal to or greater than those of      most ambassadorial nominees. I know of no statements or      actions by Mr. Hormel that make him unfit to represent our      country in this diplomatic post. Furthermore, he clearly      understands that his own personal philosophies, whatever they      may be, are not to influence his ambassadorial duties. He is      completely committed to representing the policies of the      United States government.       Second, simple fairness demands that the Senate be allowed      to vote on Mr. Hormel's nomination. The Foreign Relations      Committee overwhelmingly approved the nomination, and a      majority of Senators are on record supporting the nomination.      Opponents of the nominee should certainly have their voices      heard, but so too should supporters. And Mr. Hormel should      also be given the chance to defend himself. This can only      happen if the Senate is permitted to vote.       Third, and most fundamentally, I fear that Mr. Hormel's      nomination is being obstructed for one reason, and one reason      only, the fact that he is gay. In this day and age, when      people ably serve our country in so many capacities without      regard to sexual orientation, for the United States Senate to      deny an appointment on that basis is simply wrong. What's      more, on a personal level, I am embarrassed that our      Republican Party, the Party of Lincoln, is seen to be the      force behind this injustice.       I know that you join me in standing for the proposition      that all people should be judged on their ability to do the      job. By that sole standard, Mr. Hormel is well qualified to      be Ambassador to Luxembourg. I urge you to permit a Senate      vote on the nomination, and to join me in opposing those who      would deny Mr. Hormel this position because of his sexual      orientation.           Sincerely,                                               Alfonse M. D'Amato,                                                     U.S. Senator.                                       ____                                           Catholic Charities,                                 San Francisco, CA, July 22, 1998.     Hon. Trent Lott,     U.S. Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Lott: Please accept this letter in my capacity      as the Chief Executive Officer of Catholic Charities of the      Archdiocese of San Francisco and the immediate past President      of Catholic Charities of California. It has been alleged that      James Hormel, President Clinton's nominee to be Ambassador to      Luxembourg, is anti-Catholic and anti-religious. I know the      characterizations of Mr. Hormel are not true. I know      personally that Mr. Hormel vigorously opposes discrimination      in all forms including that of religion.       I urge you to allow Mr. Hormel's nomination to come before      the full Senate for he would be an excellent representative      for the United States to the predominantly Catholic country      of Luxembourg.           Sincerely,                                                  Frank C. Hudson,     Chief Executive Officer.                          ____________________
