 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a Kentuckian who has led a remarkable and inspirational life, Ms. Ethel Richardson Martin. In 1911 in Kenton County, KY, Ethel Martin was born--meaning that this March, she celebrated her 100th birthday. And she has much to be proud of, looking back at a century of a life well lived.  Ms. Martin came from a large family; her parents Eugene and Frances had 11 children. Ethel and her sisters liked to sing, and I am told they once sang at Renfro Valley, site of many great Kentucky music performances. Ms. Martin graduated from Western Kentucky State Teachers College--now Western Kentucky University--and served as a missionary in Georgia, mostly in the area of Macon. In 1943, with America at war with the Axis Powers, she enlisted in the Women's Army Corps, the branch of our country's Armed Forces that GEN Douglas MacArthur once called ``my best soldiers.''  Ms. Martin began her WAC training in Des Moines, IA. She served her country with distinction and rose to the rank of captain. When the war ended, she participated in the prosecution of the Germany's war criminals. She was one of the first Americans to see the inside of Adolf Hitler's mountain retreat called the Eagle's Nest, and she served as an adjunct to an attorney who worked on the Nuremburg Trials.  In 1947, Ms. Martin was discharged from Army service. She returned to America, and she earned her master's degree and her doctorate from the University of Cincinnati. She also met and married the love of her life, Ansel C. Martin. Ansel was a music teacher, and he has been missed by all who knew him since his passing in 1991.  Ethel found a career in education, and she and Ansel lived in North Carolina for a time. She was a leader in the efforts of her church, the First United Methodist Church located in Hendersonville, NC, to sponsor Cambodian refugees to the United States in the 1970s and 1980s. In 2001, she returned to her native Kentucky. We are lucky to have her back in the Bluegrass State and happy to help celebrate her 100th birthday. Her long life of service to her country and her community are an inspiration to us all.                          ____________________
