 President, I ask unanimous consent that if cloture is invoked on the Hendrix nomination, all postcloture time expire at 2:45 p.m. today and the Senate vote on confirmation of the nomination; further, that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.
