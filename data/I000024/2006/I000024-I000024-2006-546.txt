President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now resume consideration of S. 2320, the LIHEAP funding bill, and that the Kyl amendment be temporarily set aside so I may offer a first-degree amendment. It is amendment No. 2898. I further ask that following my statement on the amendment, the Senate then proceed to a period for morning business, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.
