Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Jerry Prevo and the 40 years of service he has given to the Anchorage Baptist Temple community in Alaska where he is the pastor of one of the State's largest and most active churches. Sporting an auditorium able to seat over 2,000 people and a regular congregation of 2,200 it is difficult to imagine the church's very humble origins.  The church was founded as the Bible Baptist Church in 1956 by Missionary Don White who oversaw a congregation of 300 people until, in 1971, a young graduate of the Baptist Bible College in Springfield, Missouri, was called. In just a few short years under his careful and dutiful stewardship, Pastor Prevo saw attendance increase rapidly, until there was just no more room.  He needed to do something about it. In 1973 he proposed to move the church to their present location on Northern Lights Boulevard--a magnificent 20-acre estate. The community needed a church, the church needed the community. Answering the call, the new building was built, largely, by hundreds of church members who freely volunteered their time and talents in an outstanding example of community-wide cooperation. It was then that the church was renamed Anchorage Baptist Temple.  Pastor Prevo, always committed to the education of future generations, saw the opportunity to found the Anchorage Christian Schools. Within just 5 years more classrooms and a gymnasium had to be built due to its massive popularity. Decades later the school and the Children's Ministry Center consists of 26 classrooms, a 300-seat gymnasium, library, music department, computer lab, and a chemistry lab over a 350,000 square feet complex--all built from the community's generous donations with no debt incurred. The Christian School now has over 750 students as well as a Sunday school, a preschool and all-day child care.  In the midst of running a school and a church the Pastor Prevo took the time to pursue a Doctor of Divinity degree at Hyles Anderson College and the Liberty Baptist Theological in 1978 and 1993, respectively. He expanded his community work to philanthropy by serving on the Board of Samaritan's Purse and on the Board of Liberty University in Virginia.  Today, through three radio stations, a contemporary Christian music station, and a television station he can be seen and heard daily by over half the population of Alaska.  On a personal note, Pastor Prevo has been there for me during some tough times. The loss of my wife, Lu, was sudden and painful and Pastor Prevo helped by offering the use of the Anchorage Baptist Temple and its ability to broadcast to a good portion of the State for her memorial service. In the two years since her passing I have come to rely on his spiritual leadership and guidance.  As a result of his far-reaching state-wide community work and success in reforming and growing one of Alaska's largest churches, and his extensive outreach in Europe and the Middle East, the Alaska Journal of Commerce has listed him as one of the 25 most influential individuals in Alaska.  Dr. Jerry Prevo has always worked hard and been nothing but loyal to his community and church and I commend him for his 40 years of service.                          ____________________
