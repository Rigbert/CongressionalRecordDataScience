This has been the case since the mid-1980s because we saw this big tsunami of the baby boom generation coming at Social Security. This year, we may be collecting as much as twice the amount we need to pay the Social Security retirees, building up this surplus.  So to suggest we have this terrible situation today where we cannot meet the obligations of Social Security, or that we are going to have it in 2008, or that we are going to have it in 2018 is wrong. By all of the Government agencies mentioned by the Senator from Utah, we are going to make every single payment in Social Security for 37 years, maybe 47 years. There is no crisis because we prepared for this. It is as if we understood in a family situation that we are not going to earn enough money in the outyears to make a go of it, so we save money and take it from our savings account for those lean years. That is what we are doing for Social Security.  To suggest this is a crisis we did not anticipate, I was here when we did anticipate it. President Reagan and Tip O'Neill, in anticipation of it, came up with a good, bipartisan approach.  I yield to the Senator from Utah for another question.
