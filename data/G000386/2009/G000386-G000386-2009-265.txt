  One other thing I would like to say is, obviously, thank you for the recognition. I enjoy my job in the Senate very much. I guess if you vote 10,000 times, you are just doing what we are paid to do.  It is a wonderful experience serving here in the Senate. And I think I can say--as Senator Baucus has inferred, I hope I am liked by everybody. I like every one of you. I do not know any of you who consider me an enemy. And if you do, I do not want to know who you are.  (Laughter.)  If you wonder why there is some emphasis upon voting, people in this country are very cynical about those of us in elected office. I think: What can youdo to reduce cynicism? And I thought a long time ago, sitting in a restaurant one time--and probably nobody at that time knew who I was. I overheard them saying something like: Well, it must be election time; the politicians are in town.  I heard that 30 years ago, and I made up my mind that at least one way I was going to try to overcome that for politicians generally was to make sure the process of representive government works. So when I was elected to the Senate, it was not something I promised the people of Iowa, it was just something I promised myself: that I am going to go to every county every year to hold at least one town meeting so that person who was griping about only seeing a politician at election time could not say that about Chuck Grassley, and I hope in the process it has raised the respect people have for those of us who are elected.
