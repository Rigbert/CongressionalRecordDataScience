 Let me just conclude by saying that veterans know this issue very clearly. They know that the language we have included in the IRS reform validates the cuts to their ability to get health care, if they were smoking when they were young and they now have disabilities due to that.  They are very clear on this vote. They are very clear in what they are saying to us. They were very clear to me over the last month. This bill, if we vote on it this way, will cut the health care benefits of many of our service people who started smoking when they were young.  I think that the veterans are going to be watching this issue closely. I hope that my colleagues will support me on this so that we can move to separately deal with the technical corrections bill in a way that does not undermine the health care benefits of the many veterans across this country who served our country well.
