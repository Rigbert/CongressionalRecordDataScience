President, this last exchange shows that the Senate is alive and that a good samaritan never goes unpunished.  Having yielded for this exchange, I believe we are at a moment where I can make my unanimous consent request relevant to the economic stimulus.  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate begin consideration of Calendar No. 21, S. 414, a bill to provide for an economic stimulus package.  Mr. DeWINE. Objection.
