 President, I rise in support of the goals of this amendment. I want to speak about process so that nobody gets the understanding that the Committee on Finance has given up jurisdiction over this area. We also want to explain that the offset is coming from the Medicare physician assistance and quality initiative fund, which we have set aside to make sure doctors don't get a 10-percent cut this year in their formula. That is something which is going to come out of the Finance Committee in the next few weeks.  The reason we are going along with this offset is we have found another offset that will fill the void in this fund I just referred to, so that we will be able to keep this whole. I advise people that just because we are allowing this fund to be tapped, we are not going to tap this fund again because we are going to save this to make sure we can help doctors not get cut in their reimbursement on Medicare.
