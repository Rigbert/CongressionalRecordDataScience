I thank Senator Harkin. He and I were colleagues in the House of Representatives, and he would probably recall that Congressman Bill Natcher of Kentucky on the Appropriations Committee always chaired the subcommittee that had this appropriations, the Labor-HHS appropriations, and he would come to the floor in his courtly and dignified way and announce that this was the people's bill, Labor-HHS appropriations was the people's bill.  When Congressman Natcher took a look at the rollcalls he had in support of the bill, all the people were voting for it. And I think it reflects what Senator Harkin said earlier about what is in this bill. I noticed Senator Inouye was here a few moments ago. As chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, he has a responsibility to defend and protect America. Senator Harkin of the Labor-HHS Subcommittee of Appropriations has the responsibility to make sure that Americans' lives are worth living, whether it is education, health care or a commitment to labor. Time and again Senator Harkin, in this appropriations bill, has answered the call of this country. I commend him, as Senator Reid did earlier.  This is an important bill for America. It is a better bill because of the hard work Senator Harkin and Senator Specter and the staffs have put into it. I am going to be an anxious supporter of the bill.  I have been fortunate to have served 12 years on the House Appropriations Committee and now 3 years on the Senate Appropriations Committee, but my dream to be on this appropriations subcommittee is still yet to be realized. I hope someday to make it because I think it is most important and certainly reflects your hard work has made it to the bill that will be considered on what may be the last day.                   Verification of Personal Identity  Madam President, I would like to address another issue very quickly, if I may.  Since September 11, 2001, all of us in Federal, State, and local governments have been looking for ways to enhance our homeland security. We have reviewed just about every government regulation or practice that affects the security of our daily lives in order to fix weaknesses, close loopholes, and beef up protection for all Americans.  Among other efforts that I have led--such as airline security, food safety, assuring a state of national readiness--I am now working on a bill to address weaknesses in our nation's personal identification system.  Specifically, I am interested in fixing the problems in the current disparate system we have where states issue driver's licenses without uniformity and without cross-checking with sister States.  In the aftermath of the most devastating attacks on America, we learned that some of the terrorists who were responsible for the September 11 tragedy carried driver's licenses issued to them by states that had extremely lax application process.  In Virginia, for example, it was reported that a terrorist paid a complete stranger $50 in the parking lot of a Department of Motor Vehicles to sign a sworn statement that vouched for the terrorist's identity and in-state residence on his driver's license application.  It was also reported that 13 of the 19 terrorists held driver's licenses from Florida, a state that--at that time--did not require any proof of permanentresidency from anyone. In fact, any foreign tourist could walk into a motor vehicles office, fill out a form on his own, and get one.  I am certainly not asserting that the September 11 attacks would have been avoided had the terrorists not had these driver's licenses. Clearly, there is little direct connection between the cards these evil men carried and the ungodly deeds that they carried out.  But what these driver's licenses--which have now become the most widely used form of personal ID in the country--gave these terrorists was the cover of legitimacy that allowed them to walk around and mingle into American society without being detected.  A driver's license is a key that opens many doors. In America, anyone who can produce a valid driver's license can access just about anything.  It can get you a motel room, membership in a gym, airline tickets, flight lessons, and even buy guns--all without anyone ever questioning you about who you are. If you can produce a driver's license, we just assume that you are legitimate, and you have a right to be here.  I realize that the investigations surrounding September 11 are still ongoing, but I think we can safely assume what some of the problems were that led to the vulnerability we left for the terrorists to exploit.  The terrorists took advantage of a combination of failures in our intelligence, law enforcement, border patrol, aviation security, and other infrastructures that, at some point, should have been able to discover and identify these individuals as threats.  As we enhance homeland security, it is critical that we improve all of these areas. But no amount of data sharing among Federal, State, local, and international law enforcement and regulatory agencies can be useful if one of the most significant pieces of the data that they transmit back and forth is unreliable.  And today, verification of personal identification is that weakest link in the process.  Whenever someone presents identification to a government official, we must be able to rely on that ID to be sure that the person is in fact who he says he is. That is the only way to ensure accurate results when a government official inputs that person's name into various databases that agencies use.  But today, with hundreds of different forms of ID cards that are in use across the Nation and with rampant identity theft problems, it is nearly impossible to know with certainty who a person is standing before you, no matter how many ID cards they can produce.  To further aggravate the problem, one form of ID often begets another, and can help someone assume a completely false identity.  For example, a person can start with a fake driver's license; and then pick up a fake Social Security number--this is really easy to get, and you don't even need a photo.  With this, he can easily obtain credit cards, library cards, video rental membership cards, etc.--all genuine forms of ID based on the fake original.  To begin the process of critically reviewing our Nation's ID system, I am drafting legislation to enhance the reliability of today's most popularly-used form of identification--the driver's license and State ID card.  But before I explain what this bill does, let me be absolutely clear what it does not do.  This is not about creating a new national ID card nor is it about developing one centralized mega-database that houses everyone's personal data. I understand the concerns that Americans have about going in that direction, and I agree that we do not need a national ID card which crosses that critical line of personal privacy.  Instead, my effort is focused on fixing a problem that we can address immediately and with significant results. My bill is about making the driver's license--which many consider as a de facto national ID card--more reliable and verifiable as a form of personal identification than it is today.  First, my bill requires all States and U.S. territories to adopt a minimum uniform standard in issuing drivers' licenses.  If someone walks into a department of motor vehicles in Virginia, he should be required to provide the same methods of verifying who he is, and should go through the same set of requirements, as someone who walks into a DMV in Illinois.  Why? Because if we don't have uniformity among States, we will remain vulnerable to those who exploit the system by forum shopping for a driver's license card in the weakest State. With that initial ID card, they can go on to obtain other ID cards and gain official recognition.  Or, under reciprocity, they can trade in that driver's license for a driver's license in another State with more strict application requirements even though they may not have qualified to get a license in the other State.  If we mandate a minimum standard that is applied uniformly across the Nation, we can ensure that anyone who presents any State-issued driver's license can be trusted that he is in fact who he claims he is, since he would not have been able to obtain the card but for having initially verified his identity in the same way across the country.  To set up the criteria and implementation of the uniform standard, I have enlisted the assistance of the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators AAMVA, which is a nonprofit organization whose members consist of motor vehicle and traffic law enforcement administrators of jurisdictions in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.  AAMVA is the national expert on issues dealing with motor vehicle administration, and it develops model programs and encourages uniformity and reciprocity among the States.  My bill appoints AAMVA as the regulatory document and biometric standards-setting body, and tasks AAMVA to develop the minimum verification and identification requirements that each State must adopt for issues such as:  Uniform definition of in-State ``residency''; validation of source or ``breeder'' documents to verify ID; establishment of legal presence in the country; initial issuance procedures; and minimum security features.  With congressional oversight, AAMVA would supervise the implementation by the States so that within reasonable time, every State of our Nation will finally have uniform standards.  In implementing the uniform standards, it is also important to make sure the State DMVs have the support they need to verify the data they receive. Many DMVs across the country have complained that they receive little cooperation from Federal agencies who maintain databases containing information that could verify and confirm the information that people present at the DMV counter.  For example, the Social Security number is one of the primary unique identifiers used across the country. Yet many State DMVs have a difficult time accessing records from the Social Security Administration to match the number with the name of the applicant of the driver's license.  My bill addresses this problem by authorizing the Social Security Administration, Immigration and Naturalization Service, law enforcement agencies and any other sources of appropriate, relevant, real-time databases to provide motor vehicle agencies with limited access to their records.  My bill would also authorize and fund an initiative to ensure that all of these databases are compatible and can communicate with each other effectively.  Let me emphasize here that the access to the records is for the limited purpose of cross-checking and verifying individuals' name, date of birth, address, social security number, passport number if applicable, or legal status.  It is not a carte blanche access to records that could contain many confidential and sensitive and private information.  But we know that there may be unscrupulous employees in any organization, and some DMV employee, unfortunately, may be tempted to cut corners.  In order to discourage and prevent anyone from accessing these records without authorization, or use it in an unauthorized manner, my bill provides stiff penalties for any employee, agent, contractor, or anyone else who engages in unlawful access to such records.  Similarly, my bill provides for internal fraud within a department of motor vehicle where state employees accessDMV records to make fake IDs or to personally profit in any way.  My bill also encourages individuals to report any suspicious activities within such offices by providing whistleblower protection to those who uncover internal fraud.  But setting up the uniformity and data sharing are not enough to ensure security. I also want to make sure that the driver licenses and other forms of government identification cards issued by departments of motor vehicles are tamper proof so that there is no other source from which someone can obtain such a card.  It is time to stamp out the multi-billion dollar cottage industry of fake IDs.  My bill will make life miserable for those who manufacture, distribute, market, or sell fake driver's licenses or other forms of government identification cards, by raising the stakes for those caught in the act.  Identity theft is a national problem, and it deserves a national response. That is why I propose to make it a Federal offense to engage in the fake ID business.  I have heard from State and local officials across the country who complain that they didn't have sufficient tools to go after these crooks who hang out in parking lots and on the web luring people to buy fake IDs  In most States, such offenses are dealt with a slap on the wrist and the criminals are back on the streets eagerly trying to earn back the fines they just paid with the sale of a few more fake cards.  So I believe we need to federalize the illegal nature of this activity and go after the manufacturers, distributors, and marketers with full force of the law.  Likewise, I propose severe penalty for anyone who purchases fake IDs, obtains legitimate ID cards in a fraudulent manner, or engages in any activity that misrepresents their personal identification in anyway by using a fake or altered government-issued ID card.  Last year, I worked with Senator Collins to pass the Internet False Identification Prevention Act of 2000 which addressed many of these problems. My bill is designed to ensure that this and other laws dealing with fake IDs which are already in the books are working, and if they are not, that we find ways to ensure they are enforced against criminals.  Since September 11, all of us have been working around the clock with a singular goal: enhancing security of our homeland. I believe this bill will help us seal some of the cracks in our internal security systems, and I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.  As chairman of the Governmental Affairs' Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, I will be holding a hearing when we return from the holidays to address this problem.
