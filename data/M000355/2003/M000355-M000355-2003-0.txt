 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday, December 9. I further ask that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then begin a period of morning business with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.
