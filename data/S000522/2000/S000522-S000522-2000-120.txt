Mr. Speaker, I just want to say two things. I think the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) stated it very well when she pointed out how the VFW and the other veterans groups are very much opposed to PNTR. I think what came across in our press conference, I would say to my good friend from Michigan, and he chaired that, was the intensity factor on the part of the veterans. They were very, very strong and bold about the security implications of conveying, without the annual review, permanent normal trading relations and the human rights issues.  I have had 18 hearings in my Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights. I have been there three times. It does not make me an expert but I think I have some insights and they are shared by so many who have done likewise. Torture is commonplace in the PRC. If one is arrested as a religious believer or a democracy promoter, they get tortured and we are doing business with their torturers.  I think when we look at every area in human rights they have gone from bad to worse over the last 10 years, and I think we need to say enough is enough, and I thank my friend, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bonior), for having this special order.
