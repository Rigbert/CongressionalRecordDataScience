Speaker, I rise today to encourage President Bush to move forward on his recent commitment to create a national mental health commission. In fact, I would recommend to the President that he move it immediately and ask the leadership of our institution to move the bill on suspension so the commission can begin its critical work.  As proposed, the commission part of a larger new freedom initiative would be charged with studying and making recommendations for mental illness treatment services and improving the coordination of Federal programs that serve individuals with mental illness.  I have long fought for the creation of such a National Commission on Mental Illness. When Russell Weston, Jr., a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic, fatally shot two U.S. Capitol Police officers, Gibson and Chestnut, in July 1998 right outside this Chamber, a bipartisan group of Members called upon our leadership to create such a commission to investigate the serious national dimensions of mental illness, including the lack of access to proper treatment and the violence that can result. But our pleas for the establishment of an interjurisdictional mental health advisory committee fell on deaf ears.  It is tragic that despite the high number of major profile cases like Russell Weston, Jr., John Hinckley, Jr., Theodore Kazinski and, most recently, Robert Pickett, the man who fired his gun outside the White House just 2 weeks ago, that our mental health delivery system has largely been neglected.  Mr. Weston, for example, received Federal Social Security insurance benefits but was not expected to check in to assure that he was receiving his proper medication. Indeed, it is strangely disturbing that a technological society that is smart enough to land people on the moon cannot see what is staring us in the face right here on earth.  Today, the mentally ill face huge barriers to proper treatment. For many, the obstacles are simply too difficult to surmount. Many more fall victim to the gaping holes and lack of follow-up in our system. Since the deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill began decades ago, our Nation has spawned growing homelessness and neglect as well as violence. Now our local jails and Federal prisons become the primary domiciliaries for our Nation's mentally ill. It is sad. It is tragic. It is wrong.  It is now estimated that over a third of our Nation's homeless population are mentally ill, and a 1999 Department of Justice study that we commissioned here showed that even at the Federal prison level, nearly a fifth of those housed have a serious mental illness. And I know that in our local jails, it can be as high as two-thirds.  Dorothea Dix, the great social and political activist who worked on behalf of the mentally ill, precipitated major prison reform beginning in the 1840s, nearly two centuries ago, she would be horrified by our Nation's regression. It is wholly unacceptable that over 50 years later our prisons remain the primary home for our Nation's mentally ill.  The situation is urgent, and that is why I would forcefully urge our new President to act swiftly on his commitment to create this commission. He would have the support of this Member, and I know other Members in this Chamber who understand the dimensions of this problem.  The commission's establishment will be an important step toward what must be a greater role for the Federal Government in addressing this wide and growing crisis.                          ____________________
