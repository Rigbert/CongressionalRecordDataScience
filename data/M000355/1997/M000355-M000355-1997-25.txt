 President, I listened with keen interest to the comments of the Senator from Arkansas and want to congratulate him for his decision. With his decision there is an excellent chance that today we will reach a historic high in opposition to measures similar to McCain-Feingold. So I commend the Senator from Arkansas for his conviction and thank him for his support in defense of the first amendment. I think he has done the courageous and correct thing.  I want to make a few brief observations this morning. There is not a whole lot left to say in this debate. But I wanted to refer to a few articles over the last few days that I think ought to be noted and printed in the Record.  A USA Today column on Monday, by Richard Benedetto, is worth noting, in terms of the attitude of the press on this issue. Americans have every right to expect that the press will not take sides on an issue off of the editorial page. Here is Mr. Benedetto's column of Monday, that I think is noteworthy, in USA Today. He says:       If you think the news media are providing the straight      story on efforts to revise campaign finance laws, look      closer.       Much of the reporting is tilted toward voices in favor of      wholesale reform. Those who take an opposing view are mostly      portrayed as either corrupt or partisan.       Little space or time is devoted to sober, broad looks at      arguments on all sides of the issue. Instead, coverage is      often emotional and selective. Reporting usually begins from      the premise that the McCain-Feingold reform bill now before      the Senate is good, and that any attempt to slow it, stop it      or change it is bad.       Proponents say the fate of our democracy hangs on reform.      And given a predisposition of many in the media to agree,      that message is hammered home and almost daily.                           *   *   *   *   *       CNN gives its position away in the title of a show on      campaign finance it will air Tuesday: The Money Trail;      Democracy for Sale.  This was ostensibly an objective piece by CNN on campaign finance, an issue which the occupant of the chair has just said is largely about the first amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  Mr. Benedetto goes on:       Thanks to coverage such as that, it's no surprise polls      show that a majority of Americans want Congress to pass      legislation to tighten the rules under which politicians and      political parties collect money.       Never one to misread a popular trend, President Clinton has      enlisted on the side of reform. Never mind that it was      alleged abuses of current law by Clinton and Vice President      Gore in 1996 that intensified calls for change in the first      place. He's now a believer.  Just a couple of other comments from his column, Mr. Benedetto's column in USA Today of Monday:       Media conduct on this one is not pure liberal bias. It's      another example of what Washington Post columnist Robert      Samuelson calls ``pack journalism run amok.''       ``We media types fancy ourselves independent and skeptical      thinkers,'' he recently wrote. ``Just the opposite is often      true. We're patsies for the latest social crusade or      intellectual fad.''  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Mr. Benedetto's column in USA Today be printed in the Record at this point.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From USA Today, Oct. 6, 1997]              Media Too Quick To Buy Into Campaign Reform                         (By Richard Benedetto)       If you think the news media are providing the straight      story on efforts to revise campaign finance laws, look      closer.       Much of the reporting is tilted toward voices in favor of      wholesale reform. Those who take an opposing view are mostly      portrayed as either corrupt or partisan.       Little space or time is devoted to sober, broad looks at      arguments on all sides of the issue. Instead, coverage is      often emotional and selective.

Proponents say the fate of our democracy hangs on reform.      And given a predisposition of many of the media to agree,      that message is hammered home almost daily.       Consider this opening sentence from an Associated Press      wire story last week: ``Virginia's candidates for governor      are taking full advantage of one of the nation's most liberal      campaign finance laws, raking in more than $10 million      through August.'' In one sentence, readers are given two      negative cues on campaign finance. The first: that Virginia      law is ``one of the nation's most liberal.'' The second: the      loaded phrase ``raking in.''       CNN gives its position away in the title of a show on      campaign finance it will air Tuesday: The Money Trail:      Democracy for Sale.       Thanks to coverage such as that, it's no surprise polls      show that a majority of Americans want Congress to pass      legislation to tighten the rules under which politicians and      political parties collect money.       Never one to misread a popular trend, President Clinton has      enlisted on the side of reform. Never mind that it was      alleged abuses of current law by Clinton and Vice President      Gore in 1996 that intensified calls for change in the first      place. He's now a believer.       While reform may be needed, there are several arguments for      moving carefully. For example, enacting limits on      contributions could run afoul of the Constitution.       In 1976, the Supreme Court ruled 9-0 that campaign      contributions are the equivalent of speech and that attempts      to limit them could violate First Amendment rights. How      thoroughly has that issue been aired? Not very. The focus of      most reporting is on procedural maneuvering of opponents.       When Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., introduced      an amendment last week to require labor unions to get      permission of members before spending dues money for      political purposes, news reports said he was ``muddying the      water.''       Opponents called it ``a poison pill.'' Newspaper editorials      denounced the move as shamefully partisan. The charge:      Republicans want to hamper unions' ability to raise money      because the millions of dollars they raise for campaigns go      mostly to Democrats.       But if that's legitimate cause for denouncing the      amendment, why is it not similarly legitimate to question the      motive of Democrats seeking to ban ``soft money?'' Those are      unlimited contributions that go to political parties and are      supposed to help pay for party-building activities such as      get-out-the-vote efforts.       Republicans collect more soft money than Democrats. So it      would seem in the Democrats' interest to get rid of that GOP      advantage. Yet, few raise that point. According to the      prevailing wisdom, soft money must go--period.       Media conduct on this one is not pure liberal bias. It's      another example of what Washington Post columnist Robert      Samuelson calls ``pack journalism run amok.''       ``We media types fancy ourselves independent and skeptical      thinkers,'' he recently wrote. ``Just the opposite is often      true. We're patsies for the latest social crusade or      intellectual fad.''       The anti-smoking campaign is a recent example of the media      buying in with few reservations. Global warming, too. Now      it's campaign finance reform.  Mr. McCONNELL.  Also there was a recent and interesting survey conducted by Rasmussen Research, out of North Carolina.       Most Americans think that friendly reporters are more      important to a successful political campaign than money,      according to a Rasmussen Research survey of 1000 adults. By a      3-to-1 margin (61 percent to 19 percent) Americans believe      that if reporters like one candidate more than another, that      candidate is likely to win--even if the other candidate      raised more money in a campaign.  I ask unanimous consent that be printed in the Record as well.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Reporters More Influential Than Campaign Cash?--Most Americans Say Yes!       Waxhaw, NC.--Most Americans think that friendly reporters      are more important to a successful political campaign that      money, according to a Rasmussen Research survey of 1,000      adults. By a 3-to-1 margin (61% to     19%) Americans believe that if reporters like one candidate      more than another, that candidate is likely to win--even if      the other candidate raised more money in the campaign.       ``This finding raises basic questions about the types of      reform that it will take to restore voter confidence in      representative democracy,'' noted Scott Rasmussen, president      of Rasmussen Research. ``Campaign contributions that buy      special favors are viewed by the American people as a problem      that needs to be addressed. However, most also think that      much more serious reform will be needed to solve our nation's      electoral problems.''       Earlier surveys by Rasmussen Research have found the most      Americans think the passage of new campaign finance laws will      not end corruption in government. The consensus view is that      new laws would simply encourage politicians to find new ways      of obtaining money in exchange for votes or other favors.      Nine-out-of-ten Americans believe that members of Congress do      exchange votes for campaign cash.       Americans are also generally suspicious of reporters. More      than seven-out-of-ten registered voters believe that the      personal biases of reporters affect their coverage of      stories, issues, and campaigns.       Additional survey information on campaign finance reform      and other issues can be found at www.PortraitoAmerica.com, a      web site maintained by Rasmussen Research.       Rasmussen Research is a public opinion polling firm that      conducts independent surveys on events in the news and other      topics. The survey of 1,000 adults was conducted September      27-28, 1997. The survey has a margin of sampling error of +/     -3 percentage points, with a 95% level of confidence.  Mr. McCONNELL. Also, there was a fascinating column by Robert Samuelson in Newsweek of October 6, Monday of this week. The headline says, ``Making Pols Into Crooks--Campaign-Finance `Reform' Criminalizes Politics and Deepens Public Cynicism.''  Let me just take a few excerpts out of this article, because I think it really is excellent, and sums up the nature of this debate. Bob Samuelson says:       The ``reformers'' claim they're trying to lower public      cynicism by cleansing politics of the evils of money.      Actually, they're doing the opposite: by putting so many      unrealistic restrictions on legitimate political activity,      the ``reformers'' ensure that more people--politicians,      campaign workers, advocacy groups--will run afoul of the      prohibitions. Public cynicism rises as politics is      criminalized.  Mr. Samuelson goes on:       There is no easy way to curb the role of money in politics      without curbing free expression. If I favor larger (smaller)      government, I should be able to support like-minded      candidates by helping them win. Campaign ``reformers''--who      would like to replace private contributions with public      subsidies and impose strict spending limits--reject this      basic principles.       Money, they say, is corrupting politics. It isn't.       Campaign spending isn't out of control or outlandish. In      the 1996 election, campaign spending at all levels--  At all levels, Federal, State and local--       totaled $4 billion, says political scientist Herbert      Alexander of the Citizens' Research Foundation. That was one      twentieth of one percent of the gross domestic product of      $7.6 trillion. Americans spend about $20 billion a year on      laundry and dry cleaning. Is the price of politics really too      steep?  Robert Samuelson asks.  Further in the article he says:       More menacing are the artificial limits that ``reformers''      have imposed on political expression----       Something the Senator from Arkansas was just referring to a      few moments ago in his speech----       What's been created is a baffling maze of election laws and      rules that, once codified, establish new types of criminal or      quasi-criminal behavior. Anyone tiptoeing around the rules is      said to be ``skirting the law.'' And there are violations. In      the futile effort to regulate politics, the ``reformers''      have manufactured most of the immorality, illegality and      cynicism that they deplore.       Today's ``abuses'' stem mostly from the 1974 ``reforms''      enacted after Watergate. Congress then limited the amount      individuals could give a candidate to $1,000 per election;      total giving to all candidates (directly, through parties or      committees) was limited to $25,000 a year. What happened? The      limits inspired evasions. Suppressing contributions to      candidates encouraged new political-action committees. People      gave to PACs, which give to candidates. In 1974, there were      608 PACs; now there are 4,000.       Another evasion is ``independent spending'': groups (the      Supreme Court says) can promote a candidate by themselves if      they don't ``coordinate'' with a candidate. The present      evasion of concern is ``soft money'': contributions to      parties for ``party-building'' activities like voter      registration. ``Soft money'' contributions have no limits; so      Tamraz could give $300,000. But ``soft money'' can also be      used for general TV ads that mention candidates as long as      they don't use such words as ``vote for.'' Does any of this      make any sense? Not really. Ordinary people can't grasp all      the obscure, illogical distinctions.  And he is talking, Mr. President, about current law, even before we talk about making it more complicated.       No matter. The failure of past ``reforms'' is no barrier to      future ``reforms.'' The latest effort is the McCain-Feingold      bill now before the Senate.  Samuelson says:       Most of the bill flouts the spirit, if not the letter, of      the First Amendment.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From Newsweek, Oct. 6, 1997]   Making Pols Into Crooks--Campaign-Finance ``Reform'' Criminalizes                   Politics and Deepens Public Cynicism                        (By Robert J. Samuelson)       The prospect that an independent counsel will be named to      investigate the alleged campaign-law violations of President      Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore exposes a central      contradiction of ``campaign-finance reform.'' The      ``reformers'' claim they're trying to lower public cynicism      by cleansing politics of the evils of money. Actually,      they're doing the opposite: by putting so many unrealistic      restrictions on legitimate political activity, the      ``reformers'' ensure that more people--politicians, campaign      workers, advocacy groups--will run afoul of the prohibitions.      Public cynicism rises as politics is criminalized.       The distasteful reality is that politics requires money. To      compete, candidates must communicate; and to communicate,      they need cash. Someone has to pay for all the ads, direct      mail and polls. There is no easy way to curb the role of      money in politics without curbing free expression. If I favor      larger (smaller) government, I should be able to support      like-minded candidates by helping them win. Campaign      ``reformers''--who would like to replace private      contributions with public subsidies and impose strict      spending limits--reject this basic principle.       Money, they say, is corrupting politics. It isn't. Campaign      spending isn't out of control or outlandish. In the 1996      election campaign spending at all levels totaled $4 billion,      says political scientist Herbert Alexander of the Citizens'      Research Foundation. That was one twentieth of one percent of      the gross domestic product (GDP) of $7.6 trillion. Americans      spend about $20 billion a year on laundry and dry cleaning.      Is the price of politics really too steep?       Nor have contributions hijacked legislation. Consider the      tax code. It's perforated with tax breaks, many undesirable.      Some tax breaks benefit wealthy constituents who sweetened      their lobbying with generous campaign contributions. But the      largest tax breaks stem mostly from politicians' desire to      pander to masses of voters. In the 1997 tax bill, Clinton and      Congress provided huge tax breaks for college tuition. Does      anyone think these passed because Harvard's president is a      big contributor?       The media coverage and congressional hearings of today's      alleged campaign-finance ``abuses'' have, of course, revealed      the frenzied and demeaning efforts of politicians of both      parties to raise money. But there hasn't been much evidence      of serious influence buying. The worst we've heard is of      President Clinton's, in effect, subletting the Lincoln      Bedroom to big contributors and of businessman Roger Tamraz's      giving $300,000 to Democrats in the hope of winning      government support for an oil pipeline. All Tamraz got was a      brief chat with Clinton and no blessing for the project. This      sort of preferential ``access'' isn't dangerous.       More menacing are all the artificial limits that      ``reformers'' have imposed on political expression. What's      been created is a baffling maze of election laws and rules      that, once codified, establish new types of criminal or      quasi-criminal behavior. Anyone tiptoeing around the rules is      said to be ``skirting the law.'' And there are violations. In      the futile effort to regulate politics, the ``reformers''      have manufactured most of the immorality, illegally and      cynicism they deplore.

Congress then limited the amount      individuals give a candidate to $1,000 per election; total      giving to all candidates (directly, through parties or      committees) was limited to $25,000 a year. What happened? The      limits inspired evasions. Suppressing contributions to      candidates encouraged new political-action committees. People      give to PACs, which give to candidates. In 1974, there were      608 PACs; now there are nearly 4,000.       Another evasion is ``independent spending'': groups (the      Supreme Court says) can promote a candidate by themselves if      they don't ``coordinate'' with a candidate. The present      evasion of concern is ``soft money'': contributions to      parties for ``party-building'' activities like voter      registration. ``Soft money'' contributions have no limits; so      Tamraz could give $300,000. But ``soft money'' can also be      used for general TV ads that mention candidates as long as      they don't use such words as ``vote for.'' Does any of this      make sense? Not really. Ordinary people can't grasp all the      obscure, illogical distinctions.       No matter. The failure of past ``reforms'' is no barrier to      future ``reforms.'' The latest effort is the McCain-Feingold      bill now before     the Senate. Named after its sponsors (Republican John McCain      of Arizona and Democrat Russell Feingold of Wisconsin), it      would outlaw ``soft money'' and try to ban ``issue advocacy''      ads in the 60 days before an election (``Issue advocacy'' ads      favor or oppose candidates; the distinction between them and      ``independent spending'' cannot briefly be explained.) Most      of the bill flouts the spirit, if not the letter, of the      First Amendment:       ``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of      speech . . .; or the right of the people peaceably to      assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of      grievances.''       The connection between campaign ``reform'' and the Clinton-     Gore predicament has emerged, ironically, in the complaints      of some ``reformers'' that the president and vice president      are being unfairly targeted. In The Washington Post,      Elizabeth Drew says that Gore behaved like a ``klutz,'' but      ``klutziness isn't a federal crime.'' The 1883 law that he      and the president may have violated (soliciting contributions      from federal property), argues Drew, aimed to protect civil      servants from being shaken down by politicians. In The New      York Times, former deputy attorney general Philip Heymann      says the campaign against Gore aims only to ``destroy the      Democratic front runner for president.''       All this is true. But it misses the larger point: the      campaign-finance laws are so arbitrary and complex that they      invite ``criminality'' or its appearance. Bad laws should be      discarded. Rep. John Doolittle of California sensibly      suggests abandoning all contribution limits and enacting      tougher disclosure laws. The best defense against the undue      influence of money is to let candidates raise it from as many      sources as possible--and to let the public see who's giving.      That would be genuine reform.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, also in the Wall Street Journal of October 1, there was a piece by Jonathan Rauch, who is a contributing editor to the National Journal. I want to read a few parts of that.  Mr. Rauch said:       The McCain-Feingold bill being debated in the Senate this      week has become the default option for campaign-finance      reformers: If you are an editorialist who needs to suggest      something better than today's tumbledown system, you press      the McCain-Feingold button on our word processor. Well, the      system today is rotten, and radical change is needed. But      McCain-Feingold, for all its good press and good intentions,      is a bad bill. It would do nothing to end the failures of the      past 20 years. Indeed, it would unflinchingly compound them.       At the core of today's troubles are two realities that will      not yield to any amount of legislative or lawyerly      cleverness. The first is that private money--a lot of it--is      a fact of life in politics, and if you push it out of one      part of the system it tends to re-enter somewhere else,      usually deeper in shadow. The second is that money spent to      communicate with voters cannot be regulated without impinging      on the very core of the First Amendment, which was written to      protect political discourse above all.  That is what they were thinking about when they wrote the first amendment, political discourse.       We got into today's mess by defying both of these      principles, with predictable results. When reformers placed      limits on money spent to support or defeat candidates,      lobbies simply shifted to ad campaigns that omitted explicit      requests to vote for or against candidates: ``issue      advocacy,'' which the courts have ruled is constitutionally      protected. And when reformers placed tight limits on      contributions to candidates, donors began giving to political      parties instead: ``soft money.''       The distinctions between ``hard'' and ``soft'' money, and      between ``express advocacy'' and ``issue advocacy,'' are      grounded in legalistic mumbo-jumbo, and so the attempts to      enforce them have made campaign law bewilderingly complex      without accomplishing any of the law's goals. Campaigns are      neither cheaper nor fairer nor less dependent on private      money than, say, 30 years ago--just the opposite, in fact.      One conclusion you might draw is that the 1970s-style, money-     regulating model is bankrupt. Another is that a horse-     doctor's dose of the old medicine will finally heal the      patient. Enter Sens. John McCain and Russell Feingold.       Among many things their bill would do, two are paramount.      First, it would ban ``soft money'' given to political      parties. Second, to make the ``soft money'' ban work, it      would also restrict independent ``issue advocacy.'' Voila--no      more money, right?       Wrong. Lots and lots of money, but in different places. Ban      soft money, and lobbies would bypass the parties and conduct      their own campaign blitzes. Candidates and parties are      already losing control of their messages as lobbies--which,      unlike candidates and parties, are not accountable to      voters--run independent advocacy campaigns.  Mr. President, I see that my friend from Wisconsin is here. I am going to reserve the remainder of my time and ask that the entire Jonathan Rauch article that I just was reading from be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:]              [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 1, 1997]               Vote Against McCain, Wait, Can I Say That?

Voila--no      more money, right?       Wrong. Lots and lots of money, but in different places. Ban      soft money, and lobbies would bypass the parties and conduct      their own campaign blitzes. Candidates and parties are      already losing control of their messages as lobbies--which,      unlike candidates and parties, are not accountable to      voters--run independent advocacy campaigns. The McCain-     Feingold bill would accelerate the alienation of politicians      from their own campaigns, and, for good measure, it could      also starve the parties of funds.       The sponsors are aware that independent advertising might      replace soft money: thus the bill's remarkable new limits on      all ads that mention candidates within 60 days of an      election. In the words of Sen. McCain: ``Ads could run which      advocate any number of causes. Pro-life ads, pro-choice ads,      antilabor ads, pro-wilderness ads, pro-Republican Party ads,      pro-Democrat Party ads--all could be aired in the last 60      days. However, ads mentioning the candidates could not.'' So,      for example, I might commit a federal crime by taking out an      ad in this newspaper criticizing Sen. McCain for supporting      his bill. The Founders would have run screaming from such a      notion, and rightly so: You cannot improve the integrity of      any political system by letting politicians restrict      political speech.       In real life the courts are likely to strike down McCain-     Feingold's speech controls, in which case, of course, the      limits would not work. But even if the limits were allowed to      stand, they still would not work: Everybody would race to      game the system by dressing up political expression in absurd      costumes, whose legitimacy would be contested ad nauseam in      the courts. Maybe my ad couldn't say ``Vote against McCain      and Feingold,'' but could it say ``Show the promoters of the      dangerous McCain-Feingold bill how you feel''? Who would      decide?       The potential for speech micromanagement is endless.      Imagine the fun lawyers could have with the bill's exception      for ``voter guides''--a permissible voter guide being (hold      on tight, now) any printed matter written in an ``educational      manner'' about two or more candidates that (1) is not      coordinated with a candidate, (2) gives all candidates an      equal opportunity to respond to any questionnaires, (3) gives      no candidate any greater prominence than any other, and (4)      does not contain a phrase ``such as'' (my italics), ``vote      for,'' ``re-elect,'' ``support,'' ``defeat,'' ``reject'' or      other ``words which in context can have no reasonable meaning      other than to urge the election or defeat of one or more      candidates.'' Is that clear?       So, after McCain-Feingold, campaign law would become even      more complex and mystifying. Politicians would remain      mendicants, forced by low contribution limits to beg every      day and in every way for donations. Our already weak parties      would lose their main source of funds, becoming weaker still.      If the speech controls were upheld, political discussion      would be both chilled and     contorted. And if the speech controls were struck down,      political campaigns would be run by lobbies (``independent      expenditures'') rather than by candidates and parties. Quite      a reform.       Even total deregulation would be better than McCain-     Feingold, provided disclosure were retained. For that matter,      doing nothing would be better. Best by a very long measure,      however, would be a combination of deregulation, disclosure      and generous public financing for candidates who forgo      private fund-raising--a plan which, instead of trying to      eliminate or micromanage private money, would give voters an      alternative to it, and make the acceptance of private      donations an issue in every campaign.       Alas, all of those admittedly imperfect ideas are bitterly      opposed by the anti-money crusaders who gave us the system we      have now, and who still predominate in the ``reform      community.'' To change their minds, campaign-finance law will      probably have to be made worse before it can be made better.      That task, at least, McCain-Feingold would perform admirably.
