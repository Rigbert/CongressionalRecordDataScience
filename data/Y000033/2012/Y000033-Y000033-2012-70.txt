Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In these tight budgetary times, hard choices must be made, and we should ensure that we do our utmost to put funds back into productive programs that increase the sustainability of fisheries and benefit the States, and the IJFA and councils and commissions accounts are areas where current programs are producing proven results for fisheries' sustainability.  I yield back the balance of my time.                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Garamendi
