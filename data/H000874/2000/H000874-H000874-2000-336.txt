Speaker, I am delighted to bring to the House's attention an article about the Government Printing Office from the December 1999 issue of In-Plant Graphics.  This prestigious printing-industry journal has, for a second consecutive year, ranked the Government Printing Office first among the ``Top 50'' printing plants surveyed, thus labeling GPO as the best in-plant operation in America. The December 1998 issue of In-Plant Graphics, while bestowing the same honor for the first time, described the GPO as ``better than ever.'' These accolades, from a respected trade publication, together speak volumes about the diligence and dedication of the versatile GPO workforce.  As the 1999 article, entitled ``The Digitizing of GPO,'' reveals, in recent years technology has changed dramatically the way many Americans acquire government information, and the GPO has been in the vanguard. GPO still prints the Congressional Record and the Federal Register each night for its many customers who must have traditional paper copies, including the Congress itself, and produces other printed products around the clock. However, GPO also distributes these and other products in electronic format, quickly, economically and widely.  As a case in point, late one Friday afternoon last November, the federal district court in Washington delivered to GPO for publication its findings of fact in the Microsoft antitrust case, a proceeding of immense economic significance and national interest. Within one hour of GPO's subsequent release of the document at 6:30 PM, interested persons had accessed it 152,000 times through a special GPO website established for that purpose. Simultaneously, walk-in customers could purchase printed copies of the document in GPO's main bookstore.  While preserving its capability to produce ink-on-paper, GPO recognizes that demand for electronic products will increase exponentially in the years ahead. The public already downloads over 21 million documents each month through GPO Access [http://www.access.gpo.gov], GPO's electronic gateway to more than 160,000 federal titles. The GPO is committed to working with its customers and others to facilitate that change. GPO is itself reaping the benefits of technology and passing the savings along to the American people. The agency accomplishes all these feats with 30% fewer production employees than it had just six years ago.  Mr. Speaker, please join me in saluting the dedicated men and women of the digitized Government Printing Office, still better than ever. The article follows:                [From the In-Plant Graphics, Dec. 1999]                         The Digitizing of GPO                           (By Bob Neubauer)       When the Federal District Court for the District of      Columbia prepared to release Judge Thomas P. Jackson's      ``Findings of Fact'' in the Microsoft case in November, the      court contacted the U.S. Government Printing Office. GPO was      asked to make advance preparations for the rapid      dissemination of the document. GPO, as always, was ready for      the challenge.       Judge Jackson's decision was announced at 4:30, and the      court sent a printed copy and a disk version of the 207-page      document to GPO, where print production began immediately.      Covers had been produced in advance. By 6:30, when GPO's main      bookstore reopened, copies were available. By 8:30, 147 had      been sold.       Meanwhile, GPO made the findings available on its Web site      in WordPerfect, PDF and HTML formats. It established a URL      for this information (usvms.gpo.gov). In the first hour of      release, the site experienced 152,000 successful connections.       For GPO, the largest in-plant in the country, such      monumental projects have become second nature.       Now in its 139th year of existence, GPO drastically changed      itself over the past few years from a strictly ink-on-paper      provider to a high-tech digital data delivery organization.      The public downloads some 20 million documents a month from      GPO Access, GPO's Web site (www.access.gpo.gov).       ``We're putting more and more electronic products up, which      seems to be what the public wants,'' notes Public Printer      Michael DiMario. He recently signed a request for more      Internet bandwidth in the form of a T3 line to accommodate      the anticipated demand.       The successful online dissemination of the Microsoft      findings was welcome news for those who remember the initial      posting of the Starr Report last year, when GPO Access was      jammed with traffic, which clogged the system.       ``We took certain steps to upgrade the number of T1 lines      that we have and install additional servers,'' notes Andrew      M. Sherman, director of congressional, legislative and public      affairs. A BigIP load balancer, served by five T1 lines, kept      heavy volume from freezing some visitors out.       Over the past few years, Sherman notes, online delivery has      helped to decrease print volume--as well as outside      procurement. (Also contributing were shrinking government      budgets and fewer requested copies.) Concurrently, the skills      of GPO's work force have migrated toward the electronic end.       But print is still strong. GPO's two new Krause America      LX170 computer-to-plate systems are now up to speed, Sherman      says, and they're being used to run plates for all major      publications, including the Congressional Record and the      Federal Register. The new passport bindery line is      operational, as well. And with 7.5 million passports passing      through GPO last year, the line has its work cut out for it.       In the next decade, DiMario says, GPO will strengthen its      efforts to share its expertise with other government      agencies. Already it has expanded its Federal Printing and      Electronic Publishing Institute, which offers courses to help      agencies deal with technological changes.       GPO also hopes to provide digital access to even more      government documents in the future, he says. As for GPO's      size, DiMario doesn't see it changing much. GPO has already      downsized dramatically in the 1990s. In 1994 it employed      1,701 production personnel; today there are 1,173.       ``We're probably scaled back as much as we can be . . .      without some potential problems,'' observes DiMario. ``We've      got a very professional work force. The results speak for      themselves.''                               ____________________
