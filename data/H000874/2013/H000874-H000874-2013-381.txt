We treat it like just a throwaway. I can't discuss the substance of this issue in the time allotted to me, nor can any other Member.  When I had a magic 1 minute, it was a little better when I was majority leader. I miss that very much.  But I urge both of us, both Republicans and Democrats, to come to grips with making the hard decision, not the political demagoguery decisions that this bill projects. Let us sit down together and come to grips with the fact that, yes, my friend, we need more revenues and, yes, we need to restrain spending and, yes, we need to restrain entitlements.  I say that as a leader of my party.
