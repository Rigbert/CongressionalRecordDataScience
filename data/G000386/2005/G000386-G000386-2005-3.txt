 Yes, I want to clarify the intent is not to create an additional liability where none exists today. Pharmacy benefit managers mayor may not be liable third parties. It is dependent upon whether they are ultimately responsible for the payment of a claim. It is my understanding that the health plan or employer contracting with the pharmacy benefit manager is ultimately at risk for the underlying claim, so it is my belief this will not create new liability for the pharmacy benefit manager.
