 Still, so many Americans are out of work that employers can get away with giving no raises at all.  America is supposed to be about opportunity for all, not just the few. We're supposed to be about fair pay for hard work.  I ask my colleagues to oppose the Republican More Work for Less Pay Act, and I would urge us to pay fair wages for a fair day's work. All you have to do is go to parts of the country where people's faces are worn. You'll see what's really happening out in the real America. Let's oppose this Republican bill and the rule.  The bill gives employers the flexibility not to pay overtime to their workers; instead employees would be provided comp time.  However, employers, not the employee, are provided the flexibility to decide when and even if comp time can be used.  There is nothing in the legislation that guarantees that workers will be able to use the comp time they have earned when they need it.  In fact, the bill permits the employer to deny a comp time request if the employee's use of comp time would unduly disrupt operations.  Employers can even veto an employee's request to use comp time even in cases of urgent need under the legislation.  If an employee does not accept comp time, they could be penalized with fewer hours, bad shifts, and loss of overtime hours.  Given that it is cheaper to provide comp time than to pay overtime wages, this bill provides a significant incentive for employers to hire fewer people and rely on overtime to be paid for future comp time.  The Fair Labor Standards Act currently allow employers to provide workers with flexibility and time off without compromising their right to be paid fairly for the hours they work.  Consequently, this legislation is unnecessary based on current law.  Workers should not have to put in extra time beyond a 40-hour week and be forced to forgo pay to earn time to care for themselves or their loved ones.  The same bill proposed and died in committee in 2003 and failed in 1996 and 1997 to get through Congress.                     [From USA Today, May 6, 2013]                      Economy Leaves Wages Behind                  (By Paul Davidson and John Waggoner)       Stock markets and corporate profits are breaking records.      The economy suddenly looks brighter after the government's      surprising report Friday that employers added 635,000 jobs      the past three months.       But instead of celebrating, many working Americans are      borrowing a line from the 1996 movie Jerry Maguire: ``Show me      the money.''       Hourly wages ticked up 4 cents in April to an average      $23.87, rising at about the same tepid 2 percent annual pace      since the recovery began in mid-2009.       But taking inflation into account, they're virtually flat.      Workers who rely on paychecks for their income have been      running in place, financially speaking. Adjusting for      inflation, an average worker who was paid $49,650 at the end      of 2009 is making about $545 less now--and that's before      taxes and deductions.       Stagnant wages aren't only tough on workers--the American      economy is paying a price too. Living standards aren't      rising. Consumer spending, which is 70 percent of the      economy, is more restrained. And the recovery advances at a      slower pace.       Ultimately, for the economy to thrive we need everyone      participating,'' says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's      Analytics.       The profits of Standard & Poor's 500 companies hit a record      in the first quarter. Their healthy earnings have boosted      stocks, and April's encouraging jobs report sent the stock      market even higher Friday. The Dow Jones industrial average      crossed 15,000 for the first time and closed at a record      14,973.96, up 142.38 points.       The roaring market is making the richest Americans richer      and giving them more money to spend. But in 2010, only 31      percent of U.S. households had stock holdings of $10,000 or      more, according to the Economic Policy Institute (EPI).      During the first two years of the recovery, average net worth      rose for the top 7 percent of households but fell for the      other 93 percent, the Pew Research Center says.       Meanwhile, Corporate America isn't sharing its record      earnings with employees.       ``Don't hold your breath,'' for employers to become more      generous, says John Lonski, chief economist for Moody's      Investors Service. One reason, he says, is that revenue      growth has been meager, up between 0.5 percent and 1 percent      in the last year.       In fact, higher profits owe partially to employers' success      in controlling labor expenses by getting workers to be more      productive, holding down raises and hiring conservatively.       Productivity, or output per labor hour, has risen an      average 1.5 percent a year since the recovery began.      Companies are squeezing more out of each worker even as      inflation-adjusted wages have stagnated.       Another reason for stagnant wages is the law of supply and      demand. Sure, the job market has picked up: Employers added      165,000 jobs last month and an average 196,000 a month this      year, up from 183,000 in 2012. And the jobless rate has      fallen from a peak of 10 percent in 2009.                      Few incentives to boost pay       Yet today's 7.5 percent unemployment rate is still high.      Nearly 12 million Americans are unemployed, and millions more      want to work but are so discouraged they've stopped looking.      With an abundant supply of potential workers, employers have      little reason to shell out big raises.       ``High unemployment hurts workers' bargaining power,'' EPI      economist Heidi Shierholz says. ``Employers know they can go      get someone else.''       So many Americans are out of work that employers could get      away with giving no raises at all, Zandi says, leaving      household income falling behind inflation. But employers      realize that would hurt morale and, in turn, productivity, he      says.       Still, wage increases that just barely keep up with      inflation don't make for a prosperous economy.       ``We're not seeing the living standard growth of American      workers that we should be seeing,'' Shierholz says.       Stagnant wages also hurt consumer spending. Low- and      moderate-income workers typically spend nearly all their      paychecks, juicing the economy, while high-income workers      tend to save a portion, says Dean Baker, co-director of the      Center for Economic and Policy Research.       Larry Breech, of Milville, Pa., a retired farmer who makes      about $10,000 a year, says his per diem pay for substitute      teaching hasn't changed in several years.       ``We will be frugal,'' he says. ``Fiscal restraint is      imperative.''       Consumer spending, which has been growing at an average      annual rate of about 2 percent during the recovery, would be      rising by 2.5 percent if employers simply passed their      productivity gains onto their workers, Zandi says.       Some workers are getting bigger raises. While the lowest 10      percent of income earners got average raises of 0.3 percent      last year, those in the top 25 percent saw their pay jump 3.1      percent, say the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Moody's      Analytics. Workers with higher skills and more education in      booming industries, such as energy and technology, can      command higher salaries.       Stephen Allen, an oil industry contractor in St. Louis,      says his wages have increased by more than 60 percent the      past three years. He makes about $85,000 a year.       For now, it's up to Americans like Allen and those with      large stock holdings to generate a bigger share of spending      and economic activity. The top 20 percent of households based      on income account for nearly half of consumer spending,      according to Barclays Capital.                        good news for households       A bright spot is that despite puny wage increases, other      barometers of household finances show improvement. The      housing market is continuing a solid recovery. Climbing home      and stock prices have helped households overall recover the      wealth they lost in the recession and housing crash.       And the share of income Americans are using to pay off debt      has fallen to 10.4 percent, the lowest level since the      government began tracking the data in 1980, reports the      Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, falling gas prices are putting      more cash in consumers' pockets. Such developments can partly      offset sluggish wage growth and pave the way for higher      spending.       After working off debt the past three years, Allen says he      expects to be debt-free this summer ``and then save for a      down payment on a house.''       Still, economists say consumer spending won't take off in      earnest until inflation-adjusted wages return to a normal      growth rate of about 1.5 percent a year. Baker says that      likely won't happen until unemployment falls below 6 percent,      probably in 2016.       Then, employers will begin to worry about not finding      enough workers.       ``They'll start to hire more aggressively,'' pushing up      wages faster, Zandi says.
