I think the Senator from New Jersey would agree, many times he has asked prospective staff people their opinions--and may even disagree with them. I, frankly, believe within my legislative staff there are people who think I am wrong on some issues. That is not only their right but their responsibility to give me that point of view. But at least going in, that is a pretty basic question.  If we can't ask Miguel Estrada, who is seeking a lifetime appointment to the second highest court in the land, what is in his mind in terms of his values and principles when it comes to constitutional law, then we have failed as Senators and we fail our constitutional responsibility.
