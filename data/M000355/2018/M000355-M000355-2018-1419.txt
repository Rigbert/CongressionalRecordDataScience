 President, I wish to pay respects to a member of the Senate family who tragically passed away last week. Michael Beaver was a talented attorney who served as the Senate's Assistant Parliamentarian. That followed service as deputy legislative counsel for the State of California.  Michael was just 39 years old. He leaves behind his wife, Gilda, his two beloved sons, Bradley and Connor, his parents, and an extended family that mourns his loss. They are joined by Michael's colleagues here on the Senate staff, in the Secretary's office, and with the floor staff on both sides of the aisle and throughout our whole institution. The Senate's prayers are with all of Michael's family and friends at this immensely difficult hour.                          ____________________
