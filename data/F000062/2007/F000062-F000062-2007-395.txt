 President, I rise today with Senators Snowe, Levin, Cantwell, Boxer, Feingold, Bingaman, Lieberman, Lautenberg, and Mikulski to introduce a bill to provide necessary Federal oversight of our energy markets.  Just as is currently required for trades performed on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), this bill would require record keeping and create an audit trail for all electronic over-the-counter energy trades.  Generally, in energy markets, the term ``over-the-counter trading'' refers to the trading of an energy commodity directly between two parties that does not take place on a regulated exchange.  Six years after the California energy crisis, this bill is long overdue. As global oil and gas prices increase and as we work to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, the American public needs reliable, transparent energy markets that are not subject to manipulation by traders.  Specifically, the bill would: require traders who perform trades on electronic trading facilities such as the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) to keep records and report large positions carried by their market participants in energy commodities for five years or longer. These are the same requirements that apply to traders that do business on NYMEX; require traders to provide such records to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) or the Justice Department upon request. Again, these are the same requirements for NYMEX traders; and require persons in the United States who trade U.S. energy commodities delivered in the U.S. on foreign futures exchanges to keep similar records and report large trades.  The Western Energy Crisis in 2000-2001 provided a wake-up call about the extent to which energy traders can impact demand and drive up prices.  California and the entire West Coast faced rolling blackouts and skyrocketing electricity costs, while companies like Enron, Duke, Williams, AES and Reliant enjoyed record revenues and profits.  In California, the cost of electricity was $8 billion in 1999, $27 billion in 2000, $27.5 billion in 2001, and $12 billion in 2002 after the crisis abated. Demand did not increase by more than 150 percent between 1999 and 2000. But prices did.  Why? Because companies like Enron manipulated the market in order to drive the price of electricity up.  As a result, Californians have been left with a $40 billion bill. This is an unacceptable burden.  One of the main causes of the crisis is a loophole in current law that allows for energy commodities--such as natural gas, electricity, oil, and gasoline--to be traded on over-the-counter markets with no Federal oversight.  While over-the-counter trades of all other commodities--pork bellies, soybeans, wheat and rice, for example--are regulated by the Federal Government, energy trades are not.  Our country currently faces natural gas prices that have been extremely volatile, and oil prices that have gone through the roof.  With gas prices reaching well above $2 per gallon across the country, and over $2.50 in my State of California, our constituents deserve to know why those prices are so high.  The New York Times has reported that manipulation of electronic energy trades has pushed these prices higher and higher.  Testifying at the Enron trial, the former Chief Executive Officer of Enron North America and Enron Energy Services, David Delainey was asked: ``Is volatility a good thing for a speculative trader?''  His response: ``Yes.''  When asked to explain his answer, he said: The higher the volatility that you have, the better--the higher the potential profit you can make from an open position you might have in the marketplace . . . if the price change is only a couple cents either way, you can't make a whole lot of money in trading.  And if you have, you know, 50, 60 cents, dollar moves in price you're going to make a lot more money for--for every position you might have . . .  Unfortunately, Enron's demise did not sound the death knell for unregulated over-the-counter energy trades. Instead, these trades now take place on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).  Over-the-counter trades performed on ICE are exempt from Federal oversight. In other words, the CFTC cannot require traders on ICE to keep records or report trades in energy commodities. As a result, the CFTC does not have a complete picture of what occurs in the energy markets.  The CFTC has recently asked ICE to provide information for certain electronically traded energy contracts. ICE has agreed to comply. I welcome these positive developments, but nonetheless believe that this legislation is necessary to remove any doubt as to the CFTC's authority to mandate these reports and to ensure these requirements are not administratively removed at some later date.  In this request, the CFTC has only asked ICE to report those trades that are performed using NYMEX-established prices. NYMEX does not establish prices for electricity, so none of the electricity trades will be reported. This means that under current circumstances, the CFTC still will not be getting a full picture of the energy market from ICE's reports.  Our bill will require reporting of all electronic over-the-counter energy trades and will provide legislative certainty that these trades will be reported.  We learned the hard way that if there is no oversight of these markets, they are subject to manipulation.  It is high time to fix this problem. Our bill will do just this.  That is why I urge my colleagues to support this bill. The legislation will simply provide the CFTC with the data it needs to ensure that manipulation and fraud are not taking place on our energy markets.  So who would be against this proposal?  The traders who are making millions of dollars off of volatility in these markets. And some of these traders are people who learned their skills at Enron--like star-Enron trader John Arnold who made $75 to $100 million in 2005 at Centaurus Energy, a hedge fund investing in energy commodities.  The other beneficiaries of high oil and natural gas prices are the energy companies themselves. Oil major Chevron made almost $13.4 billion in the first 9 months of 2006--a 34 percent rise in profits over the same 9 months in 2005.  The number 3 U.S. oil company, ConocoPhillips, reported a 25 percent surge in profits in the first 9 months of 2006, boosted by sharply higher crude oil prices. Net income in the first 9 months of 2006 rose to $12.35 billion from $9.85 billion in the same time period of 2005.  And ExxonMobil made more money in 2006 than any company in history. All of these record profits are due to the fact that oil prices are so high.  So while consumers are paying more than $2 a gallon at the pump, traders and oil companies are making out like bandits.  I hope that we have enough consensus this year to pass this legislation in order to shine some light on our energy markets and determine if speculation, manipulation, or hoarding is occurring in the oil, gas, and electricity markets.  I would like to thank the following organizations for their support of this bill: Agricultural Retailers Association, Air Transport Association of America, American Public Gas Association, American Public Power Association, Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, Industrial Energy Consumers of America, National Association of Wheat Growers, National Barley Growers Association, New England Fuel Initiative, Pacific Northwest Oil Heat Council, Petroleum Transportation and Storage Association, Petroleum Marketers Association of America, PG Corporation, Sempra, and Southern California Edison.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 577       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
