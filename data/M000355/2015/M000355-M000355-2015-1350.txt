 President, this morning, I restated my commitment to working with Senators in a serious way to move our country ahead on trade in the economy of the 21st century. I said that we need to allow debate on this important issue to begin and that our colleagues across the aisle need to stop blocking us from doing so.  That is the view from our side, it is the view from the White House, and it is the view of serious people across the political spectrum. I have repeatedly stated my commitment to serious, bipartisan ways forward on this issue. Now, serious and bipartisan does not mean agreeing to impossible guarantees or swallowing poison pills designed to kill the legislation, but it does mean pursuing reasonable options that are actually designed to get a good policy result in the end.  That is why I have agreed to keep my party's significant concession of offering to process both TPA and TAA on the table. It is why I have said we could also consider other policies that Chairman Hatch and Senator Wyden agree to. That is why I will keep my commitment to an open amendment process once we get on the bill.  Of course, our friends across the aisle say they also want a path forward on all four of the trade bills the Finance Committee passed. This isn't just an issue for our friends on the other side, but there is a great deal of support on our side for many of the things contained in these other bills. However, as a senior Senator in the Democratic leadership reminded us yesterday, we have to take some of these votes separately or else we will kill the underlying legislation.  So the plan I am about to offer will provide our Democratic colleagues with a sensible way forward without killing the bill.  The plan I am about to offer will allow the regular order on the trade bill, while also allowing Senators the opportunity to take votes on the Customs and preferences bills in a way that will not imperil the increased American exports and American trade jobs that we need. We would then turn to the trade bill with TPA and TAA as the base bill and open the floor to amendments, as I have suggested all week. It is reasonable.  So I look forward to our friends across the aisle now joining with us to move forward on this issue in a serious way.                           Order of Procedure  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 10:30 a.m., tomorrow, May 14, the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 57, H.R. 1295, and Calendar No. 56, H.R. 644, en bloc; that the Hatch amendments at the desk, the text of which are S. 1267 and S. 1269, respectively, be considered and agreed to; that no further amendments be in order; and that at 12 noon the bills, as amended, be read a third time and the Senate then vote on passage of H.R. 1295, as amended, followed by a vote on passage of H.R. 644, as amended, with no intervening action or debate, and that there be a 60-affirmative-vote threshold needed for passage of each bill; and that if passed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.
