I share his concern that by cutting this program we are cutting aid to those populations that are the most needy. I can only hope that this occurred because of a lack of understanding about what this program does and what populations it serves. These programs are now tightly focused on the poorest, most food-deficit countries in the world such as Bangladesh and Ethiopia.  Let me give an example of the way the program operates: Title III wheat in Ethiopia has been used to capitalize an emergency reserve. This has helped to stabilize grain markets, while providing a cushion against periodic drought. Under this program Private Voluntary Organizations such as Catholic Relief Services and Care can borrow from this reserve to meet emergency requirements, with a promise to replenish the reserve in the future. Without this facility we would have greater requirements for costly emergency feeding programs.  So here's a way, in a time when we are cutting back on total food aid dollars, that we can help alleviate problems before they become expensive emergency situations. I think the U.S. Congress should be in favor of this type of preventive activity.
