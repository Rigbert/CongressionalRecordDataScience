 President, I had hoped to call up an amendment that Senator Clinton filed this afternoon on behalf of herself, myself, Senator Leahy, and Senator Cantwell, but I understand that laying aside the pending amendment may not be an option. As such, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized to speak about the amendment we filed.
