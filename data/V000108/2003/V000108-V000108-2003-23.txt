Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to indicate my strong opposition to the amendment offered. I think of all of the discrete decisions that have been made on individual projects that were carefully considered, an across-the-board cut is certainly not the way to approach the legislative process, and I am strongly opposed to the amendment.
