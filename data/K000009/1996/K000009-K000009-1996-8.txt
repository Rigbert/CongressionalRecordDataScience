Speaker, there is an economic wind blowing across our Nation that has thus far failed to capture the attention of the leading Presidential candidates, and I am specifically referring to lost U.S. jobs and sinking wages eroded by rising imports dwarfing U.S. exports.  The latest Commerce Department figures show that for midsummer we had the highest trade deficits in over a decade. Over $11.7 billion for the last month. The trade deficit with Japan, up 33 percent. Car parts, imported cars from Japan far dwarfing our exports. Trade deficit with China, up 15 percent. Imported clothing, imported shoes, imported textiles, meaning more lost jobs in this country.  Our dependence on oil continues to grow as we see U.S. troops being sent to Kuwait rather than energy resources developed here at home.  I am glad somebody notices. The Philadelphia Inquirer from September 8 through 22 is running an incredible series: ``America: Who Stole the Dream?'' Please read it. People in America somewhere are noticing, even if the Presidential candidates are not.                          ____________________
