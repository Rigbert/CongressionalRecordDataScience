Mr. Chairman, whoever is running this mike, they better start learning how to run it.  Mr. Chairman, I want to clarify one thing. We believe, from the letters of the Committee on Agriculture, it was exactly the same, because we sent this bill to the committee and they worked on the committee through the exchange of letters.  Now, if there is a misinterpretation, I do apologize, and I do believe the staff screwed up. But we are going to work on that part to make it work, that last provision.  Now, the rest of the amendment disturbs me. This is my part of this bill, the wildlife restoration part. And what the gentleman does is eliminate the ability of Ducks, Unlimited, eliminate the ability of Safari International, the ability of those organizations that believe in wildlife restoration in participating in that program, with the gentleman's amendment.  So I respectfully ask the gentleman to consider that, and let us work on that provision which, if the gentleman thinks I misled, I apologize, but I did not do it intentionally, because it came out of another committee. We will work on that provision as we go through this process. I will do that. But those other two provisions I adamantly oppose, and anybody who understands Ducks, Unlimited and Safari, they are the biggest contributors to wildlife restoration and sustainable yield of those species. I have to oppose the amendment as proposed, but I willwork with the gentleman on that last provision.
