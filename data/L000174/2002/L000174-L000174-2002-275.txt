President, I rise today to pay tribute to a distinguished Vermonter, and my friend, Edwin Colodny. Ed Colodny spent the early years of his life growing up in Burlington, VT. After graduating from Burlington High School, Ed Colodny entered public service as a First Lieutenant in the U.S. Army serving with the Office of the Judge Advocate General. Ed's next career step brought him to the business world where he joined U.S. Airways. During his 35-year career with the company, Ed rose through the ranks to become President and Chief Executive Officer. U.S. Airways grew from a small regional carrier to a major national airline with $6.5 billion in revenues during his tenure--no doubt due in great part to his tremendous leadership.  The University of Vermont is Vermont's largest public institution of higher education. The school is one of the oldest in our nation, founded by Ira Allen, the younger brother of the leader of the Green Mountain Boys, Ethan Allen. Throughout its more than 200-year history, UVM has played an important role in the lives of many Vermonters.  Over the past decade, a number of different people have occupied the UVM President's Office. This leadership turnover has led to some challenges for the school. Last February, UVM faced a particularly difficult time when its sitting President resigned in the middle of the academic year. The school was in the midst of implementing major program reforms and budget cuts as part of a strategic plan that had been adopted by the Board of Trustees; the faculty were organizing a union; and, ongoing student housing issues created some tension between the University and the local Burlington community. The prospect of a leadership void at such a tumultuous time, while a lengthy search for a new President was underway, posed a daunting challenge for the school and its leaders.  It was in that time of need that Ed Colodny agreed to give up his work in private legal practice and move back to Vermont with his wife Nancy to serve as UVM's Interim President. We are all extremely grateful to them for making that sacrifice. Ed has skillfully guided the University through a difficult time, while continuing to implement important policies and reforms that will provide a strong and valuable foundation for the incoming President. The Board of Trustees recently appointed Dr. Daniel Fogel to become UVM's new President and he will be formally taking over the post in July. Thanks to Ed's hard work and strong vision over the past year, as well as that of his entire leadership team, Dr. Fogel will be welcomed by a stable university that is prime for a promising future.  In Ed's short time as President of UVM, he never lost focus of what UVM and all higher education institutions must be about--academic excellence. Last fall, to celebrate the University's 210th year, Ed revived the longstanding but dormant tradition of holding an Opening Convocation ceremony. This was a special opportunity for the UVM community to kick off a new academic year together, and to reaffirm its central mission of providing a high quality education to students in the Green Mountains of Vermont. Ed recognized people's desire to have an opportunity to come together and celebrate the pride they hold for their school and all that it has to offer.  As Ed said when announcing the revival of this tradition, ``The convocation is an opportunity for us to come together as a university community and reaffirm our commitment to the academic ideals we treasure deeply.'' Those words symbolize so much of what Ed has offered UVM over the past year. He has reminded us of the potential power and success that the UVM community possesses when it comes together. He has reminded us of the need to be committed to academic ideals. And, through his leadership in a time of need, Ed has reminded us of the powerful role just one person can play in the lives of so many others.  On behalf of myself, and all Vermonters, I thank my good friend Ed Colodny for his leadership, his commitment to higher education, and his service and dedication to UVM and the State of Vermont. Marcelle and I know we are all better off as a result of Ed and Nancy Colodny's time revisiting Burlington.                          ____________________
