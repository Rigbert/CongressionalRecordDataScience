 Speaker, yesterday Congresswoman Connie Morella and I announced a major breakthrough in the campaign that we initiated to get big-name sports stars and coaches to speak out in the national media against domestic violence in America.  More specifically, last January Representative Morella and I first wrote directly to the commissioners and other top officials of our Nation's major professional and amateur sports leagues. We urged them in the strongest terms possible to join with us and commit to work together to fashion a multi-faceted strategy to prevent domestic violence, including counseling, strong disciplinary action when warranted, and a high-profile public education and advertising campaign against domestic violence. (A copy of our original letter is reproduced below.)  Next we held extensive discussions with leaders of the sports industry to determine how best to enlist the voices of star athletes, as role models of profound national influence, in speaking out against domestic violence.  Then in July we introduced our legislation (House Concurrent Resolution 199) calling fornational summit of sports, political, and community leaders to promote nonviolence through sports, starting with a sustained nationwide campaign against domestic violence and sexual assault.  We are making progress because more and more Americans are willing to stand up and speak out against domestic violence as a crime. For example, starting next week an on-going series of public service advertisements, featuring football stars from the professional and collegiate ranks, will begin broadcast on television stations across the country. On this coming Monday--September 30, 1996--there will be an antidomestic violence public service announcement broadcast in prime time during the ``ABC Monday Night Football'' nationally-televised game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Philadelphia Eagles. I want to applaud the officials of the National Football League and stars like Steve Atwater of the Denver Broncos who have made possible this series of public service announcements to help us in our efforts to prevent domestic violence.  At the same time, I am very pleased to announce that starting next month viewers of televised college football games will see for the first time many of our Nation's college football stars speaking out against domestic violence.  I especially want to salute the outstanding players coaches, and officials of the College Football Association [CFA] for filming these ads as well a the generous sponsors of the Liz Claiborne Foundation for financing this trail-blazing antidomestic violence campaign as well as the scholars at the Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport in Society for helping craft the message. (The text of one of these unprecedented television spots to be broadcast is reproduced below as well.) These ads will provide a powerful start in October to a wide range of activities planned for Domestic Violence Awareness Month.  These televised public service advertisements by major athletic associations are a very positive first step in our efforts to recruit sports leaders to lend their voices to the growing campaign to stop domestic violence. I can't think of a better way to deter physical abuse against women and children than to have our Nation's football heroes take to the airwaves to spread a blunt message all across America. Tough guys mix it up on the field, but they won't beat up on their wives, girlfriends and kids.  At the same time, we will press ahead with our plans to convene during the next year the first-ever national summit on sports and non-violence. Already scores of health, athletic and antiviolence groups have endorsed our legislation and joined the call for defining a prominent role for our Nation's sports industry and athletic heroes to help lead the campaign against domestic violence.                                    U.S. House of Representatives,                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 1996.     Mr. Paul Tagliabue,     Commissioner, National Football League,     New York, NY       Dear Commissioner Tagliabue. We are in receipt of the      January 17th letter from Mr. Harold R. Henderson, Executive      Vice President for Labor Relations and Chairman of the      National Football League (NFL) Management Council.       First, we want to salute the outstanding work of the NFL      across many decades in supporting so many charities and      community-building activities throughout our nation. In      addition, the players and coaches of the NFL, as role models      of profound national influence, have already helped for many      years to positively shape the lives of countless young      Americans.       It is the NFL's record of civic responsibility to which we      want to appeal.       Specifically, we are writing to ask in the strongest terms      that the NFL join with us and commit to work together to      fashion a multi-faceted strategy to deter domestic violence,      including counseling, strong disciplinary action when      warranted, and a high-profile public education and      advertising campaign against domestic violence.       It is commendable that the NFL has taken decisive action      and instituted disciplinary policies on both drug and alcohol      abuse as well as unabolic steroid and related substance      abuse. But we believe the time has come for the NFL to step      forward, as you are accustomed to do, and assume a leading      role in deterring domestic violence among current and future      NFL personnel in particular and the general public as well.       A startling investigation by The Washington Post revealed      that between the January 1, 1989 incident that led to O.J.      Simpson pleading no contest and former pro football players      and collegiate football athletes were reported to police for      156 alleged offenses of violent behavior toward women.      Surprisingly, at the time of that review, 43 of the men      accused of domestic violence were active players on NFL team      rosters. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, only one NFL      player has ever been disciplined for a gender-related      offense: former Philadelphia Eagle tackle Kevin Allen, who      was denied re-entry after serving a 33-month prison term      for rape.       There is good reason to suspect that domestic violence is      even more prevalent among NFL players than these statistics      indicate. The Post's review did not uncover all accusations      against current and former football players. Many rape and      sexual assaults are never reported to police, while      additional charges often are kept confidential for      preferential reasons.       Since 1990, multiple studies have shown that there is a      significantly higher prevalence of domestic violence among      football players than among the general population. For      instance in one study that was published last year by      researchers at Northeastern University and the University of      Massachusetts at Amherst, it was determined that male      student-athletes comprised 3.3% of the total population at 10      large universities in the National Collegiate Athletic      Association (NCAA). But this same group of student athletes      represented 19% of the men reported to campus officials for      sexual assault from 1991 to 1993.       Our concern is corroborated by Don Sabo, a social science      professor and co-author of ``Sex, Violence and Power in      Sports: Rethinking Masculinity.'' He has studied behavioral      patterns, while asking ``are athletes more likely than non-     athletes to engage in sexual abuse? His conclusion: ``Yes, I      believe we are discovering a cultural pattern in sports that      has been hidden for too long by silence.''       For far too long a pointless, circular debate has raged      over whether the high incidence of domestic violence among      professional and collegiate football players is a sports      problem or a societal problem. Clearly, it is both.      Regardless of how thoroughly we can quantify that athletes      commit violence against women at a rate greater than the      average population, common sense and repeated tragic examples      involving professional football players cry out for      coordinated non-governmental and legislative action.       Surely you recognize the enormous influence that big-time      football players at the professional and collegiate levels,      as role models, have upon our society. Many men identify with      NFL players and look on them as both heroes and role models      to be emulated on and off the field. Undoubtedly when      instances of domestic violence receive little more than a      slap on the wrist in courts and go unpunished by the NFL, as      was the case after Minnesota Vikings quarterback Warren Moon      reportedly assaulted his wife last summer, that sends an      insidious and harmful message to many Americans.      Unfortunately, the current message being sent seems to be      that domestic violence is not to be taken too seriously and      that it is not the indefensible and serious crime that it is.       This destructive message may have been reinforced by the      recent handling of the case of Lawrence Phillips, star      running back of the national champion Nebraska Cornhuskers      football team. After admitting to a physical attack on his      girlfriend last year, Phillips sat out a few games, but was      reinstated in time to play in the Fiesta Bowl. Then he was      actively encouraged by his college football coach, Tom      Osborne, to leave the University of Nebraska early in      favor of playing in the NFL, thus minimizing any further      public criticism about domestic violence. Apparently the      lesson to be drawn from this case is that if you are a      good enough football player, you can attack your      girlfriend, still play in the big game, leave college      early, and pursue an unblemished professional career,      essentially free of nagging questions about how you treat      your women off the playing field.       Finally, we are also troubled by public comments of the      NFL's Communications Director, Greg Aiello, to the effect      that unless domestic violence affects the business of      football, then the NFL should be reticent about taking      disciplinary action against professional football players who      are charged with domestic violence for fear of possible legal      action.       That sounds like a short-sighted rationalization to justify      the NFL continuing to ignore domestic violence in its own      ranks. When an NFL player is suspected of drug abuse, doesn't      the NFL get involved out of consideration for the individual      concerned and the public reputation of the NFL regardless of      whether the player in question is criminally charged?       Furthermore, even measured by that self-interested,      commercial standard, the NFL and NCAA could have been      expected reasonably to have taken coordinated action already      to counteract the scourge of domestic violence among football      players. Consider the pending case in Virginia where a woman      is suing Virginia Tech University over an alleged sexual      assault by two college football players and is seeking $8.3      million in damages, the same amount the team is estimated to      have earned for that university by its appearance in the 1996      Sugar Bowl. Clearly taking forceful action against domestic      violence makes sound business sense for the NFL and the NCAA.       In the final analysis, it is not our purpose to single out      professional and collegiate football players for special      punishment for incidents of domestic violence against their      wives or girlfriends, although they certainly should not      receive preferential treatment because of their celebrity      status in the entertainment world.       Instead, we are appealing to you to make it a top priority      to see to it that the men who are privileged to play      professional football, as role models, help to publicly      condemn domestic violence as a serious crime and do not sluff      it off.       Not a week goes by during the NFL season without tens of      millions of viewers seeing televised public service      announcements by star football players featured in community      service and saluting the work of the United Way and other      worthy causes. Imagine the public service that would be      rendered if the NFL, starting this Super Bowl Sunday, was to      sponsor advertisements in which NFL stars help to spread the      word that real men don't beat up women and domestic violence      is inexcusable.       We look forward to working with you to find constructive      ways that we can team up with the NFL to wage an effective      national campaign against domestic violence wherever it      occurs.           Sincerely yours,     Constance A. Morella,       Member of Congress.     Bernard Sanders,       Member of Congress.                                                                    ____                   Public Service Announcement [PSA]       The PSA is set at a crowded football stadium. Various      messages flash on the stadium scoreboard, such as: ``Chevy      Nova License # JRZ-847 You Left Your Lights On,'' and ``Happy      8th Birthday to Alex Burnard.'' Suddenly, the stadium becomes      eerily silent as fans and players look up at a new message:      ``Greg Niel, Sec. 829, Seat 12 Roughed Up His Girlfriend Last      Night.'' Close-ups of fans and players looking at the      scoreboard in shock and disgust appear.       An athlete on the field takes off his helmet and addresses      the camera, ``If you think hitting a women makes you a big      man, you won't mind if we let 70,000 people see just how big      you are.'' A voice over intones, ``Every 12 seconds a woman      in this country is abused. Isn't it time to speak up? Get      involved, end relationship violence. Love is not abuse. To      help or get help, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline      at 1-800-799-SAFE.''       The spot was created by Liz Claiborne's advertising agency,      New York-based Gotham, Inc., and directed by Robert Logevall      of Bruce Dowad Associates. Distribution plans for this fall      include showcasing the PSA in stadiums at college football      games around the country beginning in October, National      Domestic Violence Awareness Month, and broadcasting it during      regional television coverage of college football games.                              PSA Partners       PSA project partners Liz Claiborne Inc., Northeastern      University's Center for the Study of Sport in Society, and      the College Football Association are promoting the concept      that it will take ``intergender collaboration''--men and      women working together--to end relationship violence. The      partnership also represents the uniting of both the private      and public sectors to create social change, which Liz      Claiborne hopes will serve as a model for other companies and      non-profit organizations to follow.       The Center for the Study of Sport in Society, a center of      Northeastern University, seeks to increase awareness of sport      and its relation to society, and to develop activist programs      that identify problems, offer solutions, and promote the      benefits of sport. Sport in Society's Mentors in Violence      Prevention (MVP) Project was established to increase the      participation of student-athletes in campus-based efforts to      prevent all forms of men's violence against women, and to      inspire men to take a leadership position with this issue.       The College Football Association is the organization which      unites 70 Division 1-A major football playing institutions      and includes the Atlantic Coast, Big East, Big 12,      Southeastern, and Western Athletic conferences. The College      Football Association provides a forum in which member      institutions discuss issues unique to major college football.                          ____________________
