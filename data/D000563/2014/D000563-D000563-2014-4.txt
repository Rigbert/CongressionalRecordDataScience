President, I speak in support of the nomination of Jack Blakey to serve as a Federal district court judge in the Northern District of Illinois. Mr. Blakey has been nominated to fill the seat that was left vacant when Chief Judge James Holderman took senior status last December.  In Illinois we have a bipartisan process for recommending Federal district court judges to the White House. Under this process, Mr. Blakey was recommended by my colleague, Senator Kirk, and I support his nomination.  Mr. Blakey currently serves as the chief of the Special Prosecutions Bureau in the Cook County State's Attorney's Office. He has served in this position since 2009. During that time, he has also served as a special assistant U.S. attorney in the Northern District of Illinois. He helps supervise all joint State-Federal investigations and prosecutions in Cook County.  Mr. Blakey previously served as an assistant U.S. attorney in Chicago from 2004 to 2009, as an AUSA in Miami from 2000 to 2004, and as an assistant State's attorney in Cook County from 1996 to 2000.  Mr. Blakey has gained significant courtroom experience over the course of his career. He has tried over 90 cases to final verdict, including at least 27 jury trials.  Mr. Blakey is a graduate of the University of Notre Dame and Notre Dame Law School.  Upon Mr. Blakey's confirmation, the Federal district courts in Illinois will be operating at full strength, with no vacancies in the State.  I urge my colleagues to support this nomination.                       Vote on Blakey Nomination
