 Senator Reid states:       As some already know, I had a mishap in my home last week      while exercising. As a result, I sustained several broken      bones in my face and ribs. As bad as that sounds, I am doing      well and recovering quickly.       I regret I am not on the Senate floor to make these remarks      in person, but my doctors have urged caution and ordered me      to stay home while I recuperate.       I thank my friend, the Assistant Democratic Leader, for      delivering my remarks today.       A Greek philosopher once wrote: ``There is nothing      permanent except change.'' Our nation's elections prove that      theory every two years. This is one of those times of      change--for the Senate and for our country.       The desks in this Chamber have been rearranged, committee      assignments adjusted, and a new majority assumes control for      the next two years. Or in other words, it's just another      Wednesday in January at the start of a new Congress.       For all of the changes, our duties as United States      Senators remain the same: We are here to help working      Americans and ensure our government has all it needs to serve      the people.       In spite of almost no Republican cooperation over the last      six years, we've made significant strides in many regards.      The new Majority Leader claims the Senate hasn't achieved, in      his words, ``squat'' in recent years. The numbers, however,      tell a different story. Today the U.S. unemployment rate      stands at 5.8 percent. Over the last six years the American      economy has added 10 million jobs. The stock market has      reached all-time highs. Our nation's manufacturers are      thriving. The American automobile industry was brought back      from the brink of collapse in spite of Republican opposition.      And let's not forget that there are more than 10 million      Americans newly insured with health care coverage.       While some here in Washington may see that as ``squat,''      the economic recovery has been very real to American      families. I know how important it has been to working      Nevadans.       And while we worked to improve the economy without      Republicans' help, we also worked to fulfill our      constitutional obligation to offer advice and consent on      Presidential nominations.       Just last Congress we confirmed 132 judges--the most since      the Carter Administration. Overall, we confirmed 611 of the      President's nominees last Congress in spite of Republican      opposition. As we speak, we have an Attorney General and a      Secretary of Defense waiting to be confirmed. I remind      everyone that last Congress the Republicans mounted an      unprecedented filibuster for a nominee for Secretary of      Defense [a former Republican Senator].       I challenge my friend, the Majority Leader, to change      course and work with Senate Democrats in confirming the      President's nominees in the 114th Congress. Working together,      we can easily meet and surpass last Congress's benchmark of      611 confirmations.       My Republican colleagues, and especially the Majority      Leader, should also know that Senate Democrats are especially      eager to continue to help American families.       Working together, we can send meaningful, bipartisan      legislation to the President for his signature.       The mistakes of the past, the gratuitous obstruction and      wanton filibustering will not be a hallmark of the Democratic      minority in the 114th Congress. The filibuster is an      indispensable tool of the minority, but Republicans' abuse of      it last Congress has come to epitomize the gridlock here in      the United States Capitol.       To be clear, I have no intention of just rolling over. I      can't. Not when the middle class is teetering on the verge of      extinction.       Any attempt to erode protections for working American      families--the dismantling of Dodd-Frank, the weakening of net      neutrality rules, or the Republicans' never-ending quest to      repeal the Affordable Care Act, known as ObamaCare--will be      met with swift and unified Democratic opposition.       But we'd rather legislate together. And there's plenty of      common ground for bipartisan compromise if Republicans are      willing.  That is the end of the statement from Senator Reid.                          ____________________
