I took heart from the statements he made in meetings I attended about the need for all of us to be more sensitized to the problem of proliferation of nuclear weapons. What I am seeking to do is to get an ongoing relationship with the President and the Senate so that we can continue to monitor the progress being made and the incentive is there for this President and any other President in the Russian Federation or the United States to continue to move forward on this track so we can reduce the likelihood of proliferation of nuclear weapons.  I ask my colleague from Indiana if he will consider this amendment I am offering in that light, as a positive, supportive effort, a friendly effort to add something that may be of value to the conversation.
