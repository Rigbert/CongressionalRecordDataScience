 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Susy Smith, who has served as my Legislative Director for nearly my entire Senate career. Her contributions to my legislative efforts have been without parallel, and she leaves with an impressive record of achievement and the profound respect of all who have been fortunate enough to work with her.  Susy is one of those unique people who knows how to make government work for its people. Her work in the Carter administration, along with her more than ten years as a top level congressional aide to Congressman Norm Mineta, Senator Barbara Mikulski, and myself, have been a testament to both her talent and commitment to public service. Her quiet leadership, innate sense of judgment, and uncanny ability to stay on top of dozens of issues pending before the Senate made her an enormously valuable asset to my office.  Susy also possesses a deep and abiding faith in the American political process, and the role that Congress plays in our constitutional system of government. She has helped me imbue my staff with a sense of their duty to serve the people of California, together with the knowledge that the work we do here truly makes a difference in people's lives back home.  Susy has played a vital role in helping to pass some of my most important legislative initiatives such as the Desert Protection Act, the Assault Weapons Ban, and the Breast Cancer Research Stamp Act. In fact, over the past 5 years, Susy has put her indelible stamp on every piece of legislation that came out of my office. Her hard work has paid off not just for the people of California, but for the entire Nation--in safer streets, in more money for cancer research, in better health care for America's women, and in national parks that all of us can enjoy, to name just a few.  What stands out most about Susy is her wonderful ability to bring out the best of everyone. Her good judgement, great sense of humor, and supportive nature carried the staff through many tough battles, long days, and stressful times. She is not only a sharp political strategist and astute policy analyst, but a terrific manager and steadying presence in the office. I have appreciated her professional spirit and have placed much confidence in her decision making and perspective.  So it is with a deep sense of admiration, some sadness, and heartfelt good wishes that my staff and I say goodbye to Susy, secure in the knowledge that she will be just as successful in all her future endeavors as she has been working in the U.S. Senate.                          ____________________
