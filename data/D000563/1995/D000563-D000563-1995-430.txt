Speaker, today I am introducing legislation to extend the excise tax incentive for ethanol use to the year 2002.  This legislation is necessary for two reasons. First, the Ways and Means Committee's recent attempt to kill this important program has created uncertainty about the ethanol tax incentive. The resulting investor hesitation could undermine the growth of this important renewable fuel program.  Second, farmers are being asked to swallow billions of dollars of farm program spending cuts through the year 2002. The ethanol tax incentive provides an important alternative market for their products, but it is set to expire in the year 2000. Farmers should be given a commitment that the ethanol program will also last a full 7 years.  Ethanol is important to the rural economy. A recent analysis by economists at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign found that, because ethanol demand strengthens commodity prices, ethanol use adds more than $2.6 billion per year in market revenues to U.S. farmers. The General Accounting Office estimates that the value to the U.S. Treasury of ethanol use is as much as $6.3 billion over 5 years.  Ethanol strengthens the economy, improves the environment, and decreases our dependence on foreign oil. Moreover, the ethanol tax incentive more than pays for itself. Ethanol production will provide taxpayers a net savings of almost $4 billion over the next 5 years, according to a recent study. The direct cost of the incentive will be more than offset by additional income tax revenues and reduced farm program costs. The Federal Government gains $1.30 for each gallon of ethanol sold in America--more than double the 54-cent-per-gallon cost of the incentive.  Clearly, ethanol is not a favorite of many of the big oil companies. But just as clearly, ethanol use is good for America. Each gallon of ethanol production capacity not built due to uncertainty about ethanol's tax status represents a loss of revenue to the U.S. Treasury as well as to our Nation's farmers. If investors are scared away because of legislative attacks on ethanol, the taxpayer loses.  That is why I am introducing legislation to reaffirm and extend our national commitment to domestic, agriculture-based, renewable fuel program. We need to give this important sector of our economy the stability that will allow it to keep expanding. We need a solid, 7-year commitment to help ensure that the demand for home-grown ethanol continues.  I am pleased to announce that this is a bipartisan measure that includes Mr. Leach, Mr. Lightfoot, and Mr. Poshard as original cosponsors. I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this legislation to send a signal that Congress will keep its commitment to renewable alcohol fuels.                          ____________________
