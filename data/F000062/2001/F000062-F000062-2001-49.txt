 President, I rise today to introduce legislation to repeal the Government pension offset and windfall elimination provisions of the Social Security Act, provisions of current law that reduce earned Social Security benefits for teachers and other government pensioners.  Under current law, public employees, whose salaries are often lower than those in the private sector to begin with, find that they are penalized and held to a different standard when it comes to retirement benefits. The unfair reduction in their benefits makes it more difficult to recruit teachers, police officers, and fire fighters.  The legislation that I introduce today addresses two provisions in the current Social Security Act that create this problem: The Windfall Elimination Provision and the Government Pension Offset provision.  The Social Security Windfall Elimination Provision reduces Social Security benefits for retirees who paid into Social Security and also receive a government pension, such as from a teacher retirement fund. Private sector retirees receive monthly Social Security checks equal to 90 percent of their first $561 in average monthly career earnings, plus 32 percent of monthly earnings up to $3,381 and 15 percent of earnings above $3,381. Government pensioners, however, are only allowed to receive 40 percent of the first $561 in career monthly earnings, a penalty of $280.50 per month.  To my mind it is simply unfair, especially at a time when we need to be doing all we can to attract qualified people government service, and this bill will allow government pensioners the chance to earn the same 90 percent to which non-government pension recipients are entitled.  The current Government Pension Offset provision reduces Social Security spousal benefits by an amount equal to two-thirds of the spouse's public employment civil service pension. This can have the effect of taking away, entirely, a spouse's benefits from Social Security.  It is beyond my understanding why we would want to discourage people from pursuing careers in public service, such as teaching, by essentially saying that if you do become a teacher your family will suffer by not being able to receive the full retirement benefits they would otherwise be entitled to.  There is a teaching crisis in California right now, as there is in many States. Yet current Social Security benefit rules penalize private sector employees who leave their jobs to become public school teachers, or public school teachers who work second jobs during the summer months to help make ends meet. They lose legitimately earned Social Security benefits. And in certain cases, their wives and husbands will lose spousal benefits, too.  That is simply not fair and not right. California faces a teaching crisis, and we need to do everything we can to attract and keep good, qualified people as public school teachers, not make an already difficult job more difficult.  The same can be said for other public employees, like police and fire fighters.  This legislation addresses this inequity in the Social Security Act, and I urge my colleagues to support it.                                 ______                                       By
