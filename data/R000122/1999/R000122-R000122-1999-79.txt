President, I rise today to pay tribute to His Holiness Karekin I, Catholicos of the Armenian Orthodox Church. His Holiness passed away on June 29, 1999 at the Holy See of Etcmiadzin, Armenia.  In 1997, I had the opportunity to meet personally with His Holiness, the supreme patriarch of the Armenian Church, in Yerevan. I was moved by his devotion to his church and the love and compassion he had for all people. His Holiness Karekin I was not only respected and loved by Armenian people throughout the world, but his wisdom, compassion and courage was renowned in international religious circles. Throughout his life, His Holiness traveled to many countries, including the United States and my home state of Rhode Island, to strengthen and reconfirm the faith of the Armenian community. He was truly an inspiration to all who knew him.  His Holiness dedicated more than fifty years to his faith, and his devotion raised him rapidly to the highest ranks of the Church. He was born in the village of Kessab, Syria in 1932 and was ordained as a priest in the Church's celibate order in 1949 after his graduation from the Armenian Church Seminary in Antilias, Lebanon. His Holiness was recognized as an exceptional scholar and sent to Oxford University for theological studies. After completing his studies, he returned to Antilias to serve as Dean of the seminary. His Holiness was recognized for his leadership skills by being asked to lead church dioceses in Iran and the United States. In 1977, he was elected Catholicos of the Catholicosate of Cilicia, based in Lebanon.  The people of Armenia elected Karekin I Supreme Catholicos of the Armenian people in 1995. Karekin I was the first Catholicos in centuries to reign within an independent Armenian state. His Holiness worked tirelessly for the spiritual revival of the Armenian Orthodox Church in Armenia. His Holiness also decentralized the infrastructure of the church in Armenia by adding new diocese throughout the country, and he restored churches and monasteries which had been closed during the era of Soviet rule.  The Armenian people throughout the world are mourning the death of His Holiness, and Armenia will be paying tribute to his extraordinary life by holding a period of national mourning through August 8.  I urge my colleagues to join with the Armenian community in remembering the legacy of hope, courage, and compassion left by His Holiness Karekin I.                          ____________________
