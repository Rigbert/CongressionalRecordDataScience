 President, before I send an amendment to the desk, if I may, I would like to make one comment on the remarks posed to the body by the Senator from New York with respect to the legislation that we cosponsored.  I want to congratulate him for getting this legislation on the tobacco bill.  I also want to express my dismay that this route has been taken and that an amendment which is very direct cannot get by this body any other way.  Mr. President, every day women of this country are being subjected to a mastectomy being performed in the morning and being pushed out on the streets that afternoon. It is called a ``same-day mastectomy,'' a ``drive-through mastectomy.'' I never thought in my lifetime that I would see the medical profession in a position where the length of hospital stay could not be determined by the physician.  All we would do in this amendment is say that the length of a woman's hospital stay, having had a mastectomy, would be based on the advice and knowledge of her physician. Whether she has a radical mastectomy, what her reaction to anesthesia is, what her preconditions are, all should be party to that decision, and not some HMO that says henceforth all major surgical procedures called mastectomies will be conducted on a same-day basis. This, to me, is bad medicine.  We also, as the Senator said, simply provide that the insurance company must provide for reconstructive surgery or prosthetic surgery, and that the doctor cannot be penalized for recommending additional treatment for the woman.  It seems to me, Mr. President, that we owe this simple gesture to the women of America, because to say to any woman that she has to go into a hospital for major, major surgery and is going to get pushed out on the street--I would hazard a guess that there isn't a man in this room who wants to have major surgery, leave with two to four drains in their body, having had a general anesthetic, and losing a significant portion of their torso, and hear, ``You cannot stay overnight in the hospital no matter how you feel.''  So I hope that the leadership of this body, hearing the capacity, the energy, the stubbornness of the Senator from New York, would really realize that the better part of valor is to allow us to have an up-or-down vote on this amendment. It seems to me, humbly stating, that this is the way this body should, in fact, function.  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I simply would like to say that I have never encountered such graciousness, such tenacity, such great dedication to a cause than the Senator from California has given to this effort for the past almost year and a half; and what a great fighter she is for all of the families of this country.  I thank her. And it is a great privilege and pleasure for me to have the opportunity to work with her in this endeavor.                          ____________________
