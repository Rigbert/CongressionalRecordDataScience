How did he support that house?  I do not want to get into that, but the fact is, the point I am making is that $400,000 is a very significant sum of money, but it is only 10 percent of what our Founding Fathers determined the President ought to be paid. Ten percent.  Of course we have him live in the White House, but that is the People's house, America's house. The President lives there because that is where we tell him to live. Of course we fly him on an airplane, because he has international global responsibilities, and we want him to get from place A to place B safely and fast so he can conduct the People's business.  Of course he has benefits of being the President of the United States, which he will lose when he leaves that office. Of course I agree with the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Sanford) on that.  But the fact of the matter is, the President of the United States, unlike the Congress, that has had numerous raises since 1969 when we were making $42,500, we will now be making approximately 3\1/2\ times that, the President has not had a raise in that period of time. If we did 3\1/2\ what we have gotten, clearly the President would be making about $750,000.
