President, I come to the floor today to pay tribute to a champion of African-American advancement, Reynaldo Glover.  A lawyer by training, Glover had a knack for business. In 1994, he became general counsel of TLC Beatrice International Holdings, later known as TLC-LC, Inc., a multinational food company started by Glover's friend and Harvard Law classmate Reginald Lewis in 1987.  Glover soon took over the role of executive vice president, and it was under his leadership that, in 1996, TLC-LC posted sales of $2.2 billion. With operations in more than 30 countries, the company became widely recognized as the Nation's largest African-American-owned business.  While Reynaldo Glover's accomplishments in the business world are unquestionably impressive, he is probably better known for his passionate work to provide access to high-quality education to young men and women from low-income families.  Glover grew up in a low-income neighborhood in Gary, IN. After highschool, he went to Nashville, TN, to attend Fisk University one of the Nation's pre-eminent historically black universities. A dedicated student, Glover went on to graduate from Harvard Law School in 1968.  Devoted to furthering the advancement of African Americans and other racial minorities, Reynaldo Glover become national director of the Law Student Civil Rights Research Council in New York.  Later, he came to Chicago to practice law. He served as partner at several Chicago law firms before joining TLC Beatrice as an attorney with the firm DLA Piper.  While in Chicago, Glover also served as chairman of the City Colleges of Chicago's Board of Trustees. Established in 1911, the City Colleges of Chicago is a system of seven community colleges that provide educational opportunities to Chicago students. During his tenure as board chairman, Glover was instrumental in launching a campaign to recruit students from the city's low-income housing developments.  In 2003, he was appointed chairman of the Fisk University Board of Trustees. He welcomed the opportunity to serve his alma mater and did so with great pride. The success he achieved in academia and corporate America helped him to serve as a positive example to the students at Fisk.  Reynaldo Glover's life reflected the words of another distinguished Fisk alum, W.E.B. DuBois, who said, ``Education is the whole system of human training within and without the schoolhouse walls, which molds and develops men.''  This Sunday, December 9, Reynaldo Glover's friends and family will gather at a memorial service in Chicago to remember and honor his remarkable life. His tireless efforts to expand educational opportunities for low-income students and to encourage African-American achievement will be felt for generations to come.  Those who knew him recall him not only with fondness but with great admiration.  Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, especially his wife Pamela and children, Reynaldo, Jr., Brian, Jharett Brantley, Ryan, and Shea.                          ____________________
