 President, when Senator Domenici wants the floor to do something, I will yield. But I want to yield myself such time as I might consume off the resolution to speak about the issue that has been discussed on the other side of the aisle.  I do not question the sincerity of the people who have been speaking to the point that we need to know what is down the road before we give tax cuts.
