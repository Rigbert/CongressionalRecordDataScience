 Mr. Speaker, on April 3 of this year, 33 bright and shining stars of America lost their lives on a mission for their Government. Whether they came from the private sector, the armed services, or public service as Ron Brown and his colleagues from Commerce, they were all serving America and serving as a shining example to us, all of the best that is within us.  I, and a number of my colleagues, went to Dover Air Force Base to welcome back the 33 caskets containing those bodies. Their souls, of course, had gone to God. But as we paid tribute to them as human beings and expressed our sorrow along with their families at their leaving, we listened to the President's eulogy which was appropriate and, I thought, compelling. He said that these 33 lives show us the best of America, and indeed they did. And as this resolution does, the President named each and every one of those 33.  Ron Brown was, as he was to so many, my friend. I particularly remember an incident where we were going to Los Angeles to speak, and he had arrived at Dulles on an airplane, and I had gone there from here, and he had a very short connection. We got on the plane and we were flying to Los Angeles, and he had to speak that night at 5 o'clock and, lo and behold, his bags had not followed him and he was in casual clothes.  Now, Ron Brown was not one to speak in casual clothes, as we will recall. Luckily, I had two suits in my bag, so we went in the men's room at the Denver Airport, and there we were, a black man and white man exchanging suits and dressing to speak that night. I am sure a lot of people said, ``What's going on here?''  Ron Brown spoke that night, and he said, ``I'm Ron Brown, but this is Steny Hoyer's suit.'' He was so elegant, I am sure that he thought my suit was not quite up to his standards.  Ron Brown contributed greatly to this country in so many different ways. Yes, he was as shining an example of what a Secretary of Commerce ought to be as any in history, but he was much more than that. He was, as so many of my colleagues have indicated, a representation of what America is all about and what its best instincts produce.  Ron Brown was indeed a happy warrior. He was the embodiment of the joy of politics. Ron Brown, for all the young people of America, ought to be an example that there are no barriers too high, no mountains too hard to climb that should preclude you from accomplishing all that your character and your energy and your commitment will allow you to accomplish.  The President of the United States, as he closed the eulogy in Dover on April 6, said this:       Today we bring their bodies back home to America, but their      souls are surely at home with God. We welcome them home. We      miss them. We ask God to be with them and their families.  The President said that we ought to pray that God bless America. And God did bless America. He did so through the lives of these 33 shining examples of the best of America.  Mr. Speaker, I include the remarks of the President on April 6 at this point in the Record.  Remarks by the President and Brigadier General William J. Dedinger,    Deputy Chief of Chaplains, at Ceremony Honoring the Americans Who          Accompanied Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown to Croatia       Brigadier General Dedinger. Let us pray. Almighty God,      source of all comfort and consolation, we ask your blessing      as we receive the victims of this tragic accident. Though we      walk through the valley of death and grief, we fear no evil,      for you are with us with your comfort and consolation. You      always prepare a table of refreshment for us, and surely your      goodness and mercy will uphold us in our grief and sorrow in      these days.       Help us always to remember these public servants, ever      mindful of their willingness to share their talents and      wisdom, not only with their own nation, but also with people      seeking to recover from the ravages of war. May their example      renew our personal vision of public service. Lord, give us      this day a new hope, as we feel despair; new light, as we      sense darkness; deeper compassion, as we experience loss. May      this hope, this light, this compassion heal the brokenness of      our hearts and minds.       This we ask in you holy name. Amen.       The President. My fellow Americans, today we come to a      place that has seen too many sad, silent homecomings. For      this is where we in America bring home our own--those who      have given their lives in the service of their country.       The 33 fine Americans we meet today, on their last journey      home, ended their lives on a hard mountain a long way from      home. But in a way they never left America. On their mission      of peace and hope, they carried with them America's spirit,      what our greatest martyr. Abraham Lincoln, called ``the last,      best hope of earth.''       Our loved ones and friends loved their country and they      loved serving their country. They believed that America,      through their efforts, could help to restore a broken land,      help to heal a people of their hatreds, help to bring a      better tomorrow through honest work and shared enterprise.      They know what their country had given them and they gave it      back with a force, an energy, an optimism that every one of      us can be proud of.       They were outstanding business leaders who gave their      employees and their customers their very best. They were      brave members of our military, dedicated to preserving our      freedom and advancing America's cause.       There was a brilliant correspondent, committed to helping      Americans better understand this complicated new world we      live in. And there were public servants, some of them still      in the fresh springtime of their years, who gave nothing less      than everything they had, because they believed in the      nobility of public service.       And there was a noble Secretary of Commerce who never saw a      mountain he couldn't climb or a river he couldn't build a      bridge across.       All of them were so full of possibility. Even as we grieve      for what their lives might have been, let us celebrate what      their lives were, for their public achievements and their      private victories of love and kindness and devotion are      things that no one--no one--could do anything but treasure.       These 33 lives show us the best of America. They are a      stern rebuke to the cynicism that is all too familiar today.      For as family after family after family told the Vice      President and Hillary and me today, their loved ones were      proud of what they were doing, they believed in what they      were doing, they believed in this country, they believed we      could make a difference. How silly they make cynicism seem.      And, more important, they were a glowing testimonial to the      power of individuals who improved their own lives and elevate      the lives of others and make a better future for others.      These 33 people loved America enough to use what is best      about it in their own lives, to try to help solve a problem a      long, long way from home.       At the first of this interminable week, Ron Brown came to      the White House to visit with me and the Vice President and a      few others. And at the end of the visit he was bubbling with      enthusiasm about this mission. And he went through all the      people from the Commerce Department who were going. And then      he went through every single business leader that was going.      And he said, you know, I've taken so many of these missions      to advance America's economic interest and to generate jobs      for Americans; these business people are going on this      mission because they want to use the power of the American      economy to save the peace in the Balkans.       That is a noble thing. Nearly 5,000 miles from home, they      went to help people build their own homes and roads, to turn      on the lights in cities darkened by war, to restore the      everyday interchange of people working and living together      with something to look forward to and a dream to raise their      own children by. You know, we can say a lot of things,      because these people were many things to those who loved      them. But I say to all of you, to every American, they      were all patriots, whether soldiers or civil servants or      committed citizens, they were patriots.       In their memory and in their honor, let us rededicate our      lives to our country and to our fellow citizens; in their      memory and in their honor, let us resolve to continue their      mission of peace and healing and progress. We must not let      their mission fail. And we will not let their mission fail.       The sun is going down on this day. The next time it rises      it will be Easter morning, a day that marks the passage from      loss and despair to hope and redemption, a day that more than      any other reminds us that life is more than what we know,      life is more than what we can understand, life is more than,      sometimes, even we can bear. But life is also eternal. For      each of these 33 of our fellow Americans and the two fine      Croatians that fell with them, their day on Earth was too      short, but for our country men and women we must remember      that what they did while the sun was out will last with us      forever.       If I may now, I would like to read the names of all of      them, in honor of their lives, their service and their      families:       Staff Sergeant Gerald Aldrich       Ronald Brown       Duane Christian       Barry Conrad       Paul Cushman III       Adam Darling       Captain Ashley James Davis       Gail Dobert       Robert Donovan       Claudio Eli a       Staff Sergeant Robert Farrington, Jr.       David Ford       Carol Hamilton       Kathryn Hoffman       Lee Jackson       Stephen Kaminski       Katherine Kellogg       Technical Sergeant Shelly Kelly       James Lewek       Frank Maier       Charles Meissner       William Morton       Walter Murphy       Lawrence Payne       Nathaniel Nash       Leonard Pieroni       Captain Timothy Schafer       John Scoville       I. Donald Terner       P. Stuart Tholan       Technical Sergeant Cheryl Ann Turnage       Naomi Warbasse       Robert Al Whittaker       Today we bring their bodies back home to America, but their      souls are surely at home with God. We welcome them home. We      miss them. We ask God to be with them and their families.       God bless you all, and God bless our beloved nation. Amen.
