President. I will be very brief.  I specifically want to talk on this matter with respect to the evidence which would be considered in these suits. The sponsors of the substitute have made it very clear in the Senate that we will strike the clear and convincing evidence standard. It is an important point that the Senator from South Carolina has made.  What we have indicated is that we think it is in the public interest to essentially use the standard the Senate adopted in the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act which passed overwhelmingly in the Senate. So we have something already with a strong level of bipartisan support, and it is an indication again that the sponsors of the substitute want to be sympathetic and address the points being made by the Senator from South Carolina.  But at the end of the day, this is not legislation about trial lawyers or campaign finance. And I have not mentioned either of those subjects on the floor of the Senate. But this is about whether or not the Senate is going to act now, when we have a chance to address this, in a deliberative way, and produce good Government--something which will make sense for consumers and plaintiffs who are wronged and at the same time ensure that we do not have tumult in the marketplace early next year.  I am very hopeful we can go forward with this legislation.  I thank the Presiding Officer for the opportunity to respond. I yield the floor.
