 President, yesterday one of my colleagues came to the floor to talk about my objection to the unanimous consent request relating to the nomination of William R. Evanina.  When I noticed my intention to place a hold on this nominee back in June of this year, I made it very clear to the public and to the administration my reasons for doing so, and I put my statement of those reasons in the Record. I have done that consistently, not only since the rules of the Senate require every Member to do that but even before that rule was ever put in place. When I put a hold on a bill or a hold on a nominee, I don't ever want anybody to, say, put the adjective ``secret'' before the word ``hold'' because there is nothing secret about what I do when I place a hold on something.  The Judiciary Committee has experienced difficulty in obtaining relevant documents and briefings from the Justice Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.  For example, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein personally assured me the Senate Judiciary Committee would receive equal access to information that had been provided to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence with regard to any concessions in its negotiations regarding pending subpoenas from that committee related to the 2016 election controversies. I have not received equal access, as promised, on that front.  On August 7 of this year, I wrote to the Justice Department and pointed out that the House Intelligence Committee had received documents related to Bruce Ohr that we had not received. The Department initially denied those records had been provided to the House Intelligence Committee. After my staff confronted the Department on that misinformation, we eventually received some Bruce Ohr documents.  In that 2018 letter I have referred to, I asked for documents based on my equal access agreement with Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein, and as you might expect, I have not received a response to date.  This morning, I had Acting Attorney General Whitaker in my office for issues he wanted to bring up, but I also had an opportunity to present him with three pages--fairly finely printed--that had a multitude of requests for information that in my constitutional role of oversight of the Justice Department, they should be providing to me. Some of them have nothing to do with this hold, but the Department does have a pretty good record of not responding to this chairman of the Judiciary Committee on things I have a constitutional responsibility to do.  I also have a promise from these Department heads that they will supply information when Congress asks for it. Since that 2018 letter, I have learned the Justice Department has taken the position that Director Coats has prohibited them from sharing the requested records with the committee.  In addition to the records that were requested in May of this year, the Director of National Intelligence and the Justice Department provided a briefing in connection with a pending House Intel subpoena to which no Senate Judiciary Committee member was invited. Thus far, the committee's attempts to schedule any equivalent briefing have been ignored. The administration's lack of cooperation has forced my hand. So then, I continue to press for this hold on this nominee.  My objection, if there were ever a request for a unanimous consent to move ahead, is not intended to question the credentials of Mr. Evanina in any way whatsoever. However, the executive branch must recognize it has an ongoing obligation to respond to congressional inquiries in a timely and reasonable manner.                          ____________________
