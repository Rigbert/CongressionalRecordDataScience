Speaker, yesterday was a historic day. The passage of welfare reform is long overdue. If we listen to the speeches on this floor, we heard Member after Member stand up and say we need to put people to work. The first test of sincerity on those speeches will come today or tomorrow on the question of whether we raise the minimum wage in America.  Think about how many millions of Americans are struggling today at a minimum wage job trying to stay off welfare. The Republican leadership, Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Dole, have both resisted our efforts to raise the minimum wage so people who are doing the personally responsible thing for theirfamilies will receive a decent wage. Those coming off welfare because of reform need to have an opportunity to move to a job where they can make a living.  The first test of sincerity on the welfare reform bill is whether we will leave this week defying the Republican leadership, Mr. Dole and Mr. Gingrich, and increase the minimum wage. If we fail to do that, the critics can just say that this welfare reform debate was political hot air.                          ____________________
