President, there is much at the Organization of American States that needs to be reformed, but the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, IACHR, is not among them. Yet that is what the Government of Ecuador and some other Latin American governments purport to be calling for when the OAS general assembly meets this coming Friday.  In reality, it is not about reform at all but a concerted effort to severely weaken the IACHR, the one institution in the Americas that has been a consistent, strong defender of free expression and other fundamental human rights that have been too often denied by those same governments.  I have spoken previously about the courageous work of Colombian lawyer Dr. Catalina Botero, the special rapporteur for freedom of expression. I have also spoken about the efforts by Ecuador's President Rafael Correa to intimidate and control what remains of an independent press in his country. So I will not repeat myself here.  But the United States is the largest contributor to the OAS, and we have provided additional funds in recent years to support the critically important work of the IACHR. I want to be sure Senators are aware of what is happening, as it could have serious consequences for our future support for the OAS. I ask unanimous consent that an article in the Washington Post by Cesar Gaviria Trujillo, former President of Colombia and Secretary General of the OAS, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From The Washington Post, Mar. 19, 2013]                    Muzzling a Free-Speech Champion                      (By Cesar Gaviria Trujillo)       Cesar Gaviria Trujillo is a former president of Colombia      and past secretary general of the Organization of American      States.       A historic showdown set to occur at Friday's meeting of the      general assembly of the Organization of American States could      determine the future of human rights protections throughout      the Western Hemisphere.       A group of nations led by Ecuador is pushing to ``reform''      the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and its office      on freedom of expression. The purported aim of these changes      is to ``strengthen'' human rights protections. If      implemented, however, the reforms will severely weaken the      commission and make it easier for governments to ignore basic      rights and limit free speech.       When I served as president of Colombia from 1990 to 1994, I      saw how difficult it could be for national institutions to      evolve and change without external pressure. As secretary      general of the OAS between 1994 and 2004, I saw firsthand how      effective the Inter-American Commission could be in providing      this pressure when nations needed help to move forward on      human rights.       The commission has played a crucial role, particularly in      defending the principles of the Inter-American Democratic      Charter. It has pressed for transparency and fair elections,      and, equally important, it has intervened when governments      sought to undermine judicial independence or free speech. A      genuine democracy requires checks and balances as well as      freedom of the press.       The changes being promoted would drastically curtail the      autonomy that has been critical to the Inter-American      Commission's success. One proposal would prevent the      commission from obtaining funds from outside the region,      effectively putting a financial stranglehold on the panel. As      of this year, about a third of the commission's budget comes      from Europe.       This measure would have a devastating impact, especially on      the commission's Special Rapporteurship for Freedom of      Expression, which for many years has led the fight for press      freedoms throughout the region and has served as a constant      thorn in the side of governments that do not believe in free      speech. The office stands to lose virtually all of its      budget, making it easier for governments to prosecute their      critics, impose censorship and close independent media      outlets.       Another reform under consideration would prevent states      that have not ratified the American Convention on Human      Rights from nominating members to the commission. This      measure appears to be designed to limit the involvement of      the United States and Canada, neither of which has ratified      the convention though they are nonetheless subject to its      monitoring and, most important, are major sources of      financial and political support for its work.       Our region has made important progress on human rights      since the dark days of the Cold War. Nearly all of this      hemisphere's dictatorships have been replaced by democracies.      Yet these democracies have at times trampled on free speech      and other fundamental rights. The Inter-American human rights      system is the best mechanism we have for ensuring that      governments in the Americas do a better job of protecting      these rights and freedoms.       So far, only a handful of countries have joined Ecuador in      this determined effort to weaken our regional human rights      system. Those governments that are truly committed to human      rights and democracy must stand up for the commission this      week and put an end to this ill-conceived campaign.                          ____________________
